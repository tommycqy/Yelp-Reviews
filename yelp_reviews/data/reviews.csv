"Note that El Camion IS OPEN during COVID for TAKEOUT, DELIVERY, &amp; DINE OUTSIDE!

Wow wow wow idk why I never came here in college, but El Camion is definitely my new favorite spot for Mexican food in U-District!

My boyfriend and I came here yesterday for dinner and were pleased by the quality of food and quality of service here. They&apos;re menu is expansive and includes everything from tacos to mole to burritos to camarones a la diabla (spicy shrimp). I ordered a chicken burrito ($9.42) and my boyfriend ordered chicken enchiladas ($12.75) to go. 

The chicken burrito weighed at least a pound and was stuffed with moist chicken, cheese, cilantro, rice, black beans, sour cream, and tomatoes. I poured some salsa verde and salsa rojo on top, and it was BOMB. Every bite was just bursting with flavor! I was a happy camper with lots of yummy leftovers for breakfast the next day. Next time, I hope to order the same burrito smothered in verde sauce (+$1.50). My boyfriend also enjoyed his chicken enchiladas with mol√© sauce and was very full and satisfied after dinner.

The atmosphere is pleasant, considering that it&apos;s a food truck right off the main interstate street. They have string lights above and five outdoor tables spaces out, three of which are under a tarp if you&apos;re interested in sitting outside.

Service was good. We only had to wait 15-20 minutes after ordering and the lady handing out orders gave us extra sauce after asking. 

All employees were wearing masks (over their mouths and noses!) and there is a big bottle of hand sanitizer right by the register. People were also good at social distancing, and it&apos;s much easier to spread out since it&apos;s outdoors.

Overall: 5/5 for food, 5/5 for service, 5/5 for health and safety measures","I have heard legend of the burritos and other food here, but have had less opportunity to venture out since the onset of COVID. Thankfully, El Camion is available on DoorDash to help make things feel a little more normal. I had the steak quesadilla and trust and believe this was the fattest quesadilla I ever did see and it was incredible. Even a clean plate club like me couldn&apos;t finish this; it reheated pretty well the next day but I&apos;d recommend splitting something.","I love this location of El Camion!! They are consistently amazing. I have tried a number of things on the menu bust mostly tacos. Their chicken tacos and shrimp tacos are by far my favorite. The shrimp tacos come with fresh avocado that is always perfectly ripe. Their salsas are also super tasty. They can be a bit slow, but I don&apos;t mind as they are usually busy and it&apos;s only a few people working because it&apos;s a food truck.

The best thing about this location for me is the employees. My husband is usually the one who goes and picks it up, sometimes I will go. ONE time we brought our daughter with us and they gave her a free strawberry pastry that she loved. Now every time my husband has been back (months from them meeting our daughter) they ALWAYS ask about her. How kind! With the amount of people that eat at this location, I am so impressed and touched that they remember our kiddo. If the business survives the pandemic, they have a fan for life!!","Love love love their tamales!! Most bang for your buck food truck! 

Highly recommend their tamales - cheap, delicious and wholesome! They have a variety so I would go with any and you&apos;d be good. I think it&apos;s good for people who are on a budget and don&apos;t really feel like cooking during a week where you have so much work to do. 

I&apos;m sure their other dishes are just as amazing because I&apos;ve seen people line up near the Northeast Seattle food truck location during lunch and it gets busy. I&apos;ve also tried the one in Ballard but that location appears to be closed which is too bad because that&apos;s where the variety of tamales are based.","El Camion is probably the best Mexican food in Seattle proper, although that may be the equivalent to being the smartest idiot. That being said, the food here is real good and these people are not dumb. That was just an analogy. 


If you are looking to pay $16 plus a tip for some mediocre Mexican food like a lot of places in Seattle, you should go somewhere else. They serve up food of the people, you&apos;re able to get a filling, delicious meal for less than $11 and fast.

They offer an excellent variety of different Mexican food but you can never go wrong with the burritos here. I went in this evening and got a hearty carne asada burrito weighing in at over a pound and a half. 

I&apos;ve lived in Seattle a few years now and El Camion has always been a reliable staple of mine. Very good!","Hidden taco truck near uw and located in standpoint. Decent size parking lot and this place has standing room heated dining. The tacos were pretty good, tortilla was on the better side. The meat was kinda dry. The horchata was very good.","El camion is Spanish for &apos;the truck&apos;. As in food truck. Located in the university area this is one of several locations and it has a permanent spot plus parking and  covered tables. 

Food: we tried the veggie burrito, pork enchiladas,fish tacos and shrimp quesadilla. Everything was completely awesome and flavorful. 

Service: Friendly and efficient. Doesn&apos;t get any better than this. 

We are going back.","This place is a great bang for your buck. Lots a good food for a decent price! Be aware that the wait might be a little long depending on what time you go. If you are in lunch hours I&apos;d recommend ordering online. I get the Plato Mexicano. Its flavorful and juicy. They also have an assortment of sauces you can request. With the Carne Asada, the lady recommended the Avocado or Chipotle. Went along perfectly. Great for if you&apos;re feeling hungry and want a warm meal.","I have never had one of their burritos without having a slight stomach ache afterwards. Not because there&apos;s anything wrong with the burritos I just eat twice what I reasonably should here. Their burritos are rich, delicious, just sloppy enough, and enormous. I hit this place up at least like once every two months. Very crave-able, very satisfying, and I would 100% recommend.","I didn&apos;t expect to find mexican food this good in Seattle. We had burritos and they were fantastic, we were already thinking about when we could come back as we were pulling out of the parking lot. I tried the adobado, per the dude working there&apos;s request, and it was super flavorful and delicious. I also tried a couple of bites of the asada burrito and the asada was amazing! The chipotle salsa was to die for, I wish they bottled it. The guy taking our order was also super nice. I&apos;ll be back very soon!","Good tacos and location. This food truck is open often and is easy to get to. There&apos;s a big parking lot and it&apos;s right off sand point. There&apos;s some picnic benches for outdoor eating. The staff are friendly and fairly fast.
I&apos;ve gotten tacos and burritos here and enjoyed both. They have good flavor and a nice salsa to go with it. 

It would be nice if the staff put their masks over their nose and not just their mouth.",Amazing!!! clean facility and fresh food you won&apos;t believe it came from a truck!!! The people were super friendly and took the time to explain things to me and answer all my questions the location was easy to find the parking was great there are times they are super busy as long as you don&apos;t go in a hurry but they do their best to get you in and out in a timely manner I will definitely be going back to this place several times over and over you can never get too much good Mexican food.,"I had to increase the overall rating here because while I wasn&apos;t thrilled about what I ordered, my friend who is a very hard to please carne asada person loved their carne asada burrito, saying it was the best in the PNW!","El Camion has been a favorite or ours for well over a decade. When the Sand Point truck arrived we were thrilled and have eaten there plenty of times. Last night was the first time things were totally off. Picked up our online order around 6:30 and the carne asada was super dry, some burnt. The preparation appeared rushed and things looked sloppy. Flavors weren&apos;t as savory and authentic.  Not sure what went wrong but it was saddening. Hope things return to normal soon.","These MF tacos S-L-A-P!!!

The chicken tacos, the steak joints, the shrimp ones and shoooot even the pork ones are all delectable. 

The quesadillas make my mouth water and they have a plethora of different sauces, I recommend trying every singe one. 

I&apos;ve never had a bad experience, they always give me an overwhelming amount of meat and rice and of course I love that. AND it&apos;s affordable. 

The fact that they support Black Lives Matter is just another overall plus. Support this business they&apos;re tasty. 

***Pro-tip: If you&apos;re a tad bit impatient call in 10-15 min before you arrive and it&apos;ll be done upon arrival","First time visiting this El Camion taco truck. It was pretty darn good. 
Also first time getting their burritos. Normally just go with the &quot;street tacos&quot;. But may now be a convert to burritos. Especially when they weigh over 2lbs each. And yes I weighed them at home on my food scale. 

Hubby had the fish burrito. He loves the El Chupacabra version and wanted to compare. I think he prefers El Chupacabra but that&apos;s based on dine in and not to go. I guess we will have to get takeout from El Chupacabra soon. (Oh rats) I had the carne asada burrito and while it was good I wish I would have got chicken instead. 

 When hubby arrived for pickup there were at least 5 people in line in front of him including one person ordering for at least 8 people. . Hubby was smart &amp; went &amp; sat in his truck til he saw that large order filled. 

Great staff went on an ingredient run to the nearest grocery store to keep supplies in stock to meet order demand. 

Will return again!","Forget your lunch plans because you have new ones!  
El Cami√≥n is the best authentic Mexican food I&apos;ve had in Seattle, period.  I used to live in Oaxaca and worked in Mexico City so though I am blonde, I consider myself to be an excellent judge and tough critic when it comes to Mexican food.
I was hungry after tennis so I ordered a lot, little did I know the servings were so big, yeah :)  We ended up having Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos for lunch with four different kinds of salsa.  
For dinner we had the special of the day, Chile Rellenos with black beans and rice. DIOS M√çO, que rico!  
My boyfriend and I are officially full now smiling on the couch.  
Gracias a √âl Camion, Bien Hecho y Buen Provencho!","Closest spot to the Mexican food I miss in SoCal, these guys are great. Gorditas are great and the tripas is really good (some places do them terribly)","Everytime I come to this truck my order gets messed up in a different way. I asked for a burrito with asada and no rice. I ended up with dry shredded beef that tastes like it&apos;s been in a crock pot for two days it&apos;s so dry.
And full Of rice. So I got nothing but a tortilla filled with rice a couple couple shreds of horribly dry beef. And the second burrito I got was also supposed to be asada and they gave me pork!!!
This is the last time I got to el camion!!!!","It&apos;s an okay spot for tacos. Good bonus points because it&apos;s a decent spot to pick up food if you&apos;re hungry and going to the Burke-Gilman brewing next door (you can bring food inside). 

We picked up tacos. Overall tacos were decent but they were average. Adobada - spicy grilled pork was decent. Juicy but a little salty.  Chorizo - I didn&apos;t like it. A little too moist kind of like a sloppy joe more than the dryer spiced chorizo. Not my favorite. Carne - probably the best of the tacos I had. Good! Shrimp - decent but the shrimp itself lacked flavors to make it special. 

Service was great and friendly. 

If you&apos;re hungry and need an option, it&apos;s a good place. I heard their burritos are way better so will have try their burritos next time. But it didn&apos;t knock it out of the park for me. It simply fed me and I was satisfied.",Exceptional service! It was fun watching him gently knead the dough and then dip it in the fryer. Husband had a bison taco and I had pulled pork and both were outstanding! He had the fry bread with their house made lemon curd and it was divine. 10 stars!,Off the Rez is amazing!! 10/10 would always get the bison taco or something sweet!! The coffee is amazing also!,"This is interesting combo: Indian flatbread with contemporary Taco.  I ordered bison and chili choices and both are pretty good.  Indian Flatbread was fluffy, the meat and the topping mixed well, together was a great intriguing snack.  It was a small taco so you will need 2 for lunch/dinner. 
Also the cafe is next to the museum so You can tell the entrance staff withiutbbiuyjng the ticket and park the lot in front of the museum and cafe.  Pay by mobile or the machine for parking fee (the day we visited, the machine was broken, we paid and extended hours by mobile app).  
The staffs were nice and the cafe was clean and neat.  We will be back!","Off The Rez was off the hook.

Came here because it was parked at Optimism Brewing where they do not sell food, thank goodness Off The Rez saved me from starvation at a birthday gathering. Not sure exactly how to describe this truck as it&apos;s not a taco truck, but they do have tacos. They call them, &quot;Indian tacos&quot; because it&apos;s starved on an air-fried bread which to my surprise, it was delicious. 2 tacos was filling! The guy that served me was also really nice. 

Now that I have time to sit down and do some research, this truck is known for their air-fried bread that they serve in more variety besides tacos. I hope to see them again next time I visit Optimism Brewing, but I guess they rotate out the food trucks on a daily so make sure you follow their schedule.

Tell me about your experience if you&apos;ve been here or is going to after reading this review:)","We were first introduced to these guys at the food and wine experience in 2019. Living over in Yakima, the name was instantly intriguing, and after talking to the guys, we liked them even more.

The guys running the place is super cool bunch that are taking a traditional native dish and giving it a little modern flair. Most of the fry bread we have on the side of the mountains is of the sweet variety - The first time I had one, it reminded me of a thick, smaller elephant ear with a lot of good stuff on top. Here they sell a couple different versions. The sweet fry bread is more what we have been used to and they serve it with any of a number of different topping options. We were pretty impressive what they were offering! The guava curd was ultimately the choice and it was legit! If the English Tea-aristocracy gets wind of it, they may trade out their lemon curd! Honey, a bunch of different berries and cinnamon/sugar were the other options and I imagine all are legit!

The savory options are termed Indian Tacos. These are probably the best we&apos;ve ever tasted! We had a braised bison one and it was pretty amazing. The opportunity to consume a less common meat on some next level fried carbs was exactly what we were looking for.

The place has a decent amount of seating and you can go into the museum front room and eat as well. They&apos;ve got decent beverage options including- beer - wine - pop - coffee &amp; juice.

While it&apos;s not the most convenient location, the food is exceptionally good and the guys running the place are doing a solid job. If you&apos;re in the area, it&apos;s definitely worth your time to check it out.",I love this place and love the consistency of quality each time! Both food truck and museum locations have been satisfactory. It is packaged well and the customer service is great!,"This review is for the brick and mortar location, not the truck. Off the Rez is so delicious and their fry bread is made fresh, with high-quality ingredients, at extremely reasonable prices.  I have nothing bad to say about anything we ate at this restaurant and wish it was open later or had another location so we could here more often!

The chili taco is the play here - I went with the classic beef but have heard good things about the others ones as well.  There was a generous amount of chili on the bread and it was flavorful and spiced well but wasn&apos;t spicy hot.  We also got the seasonal cranberry fry bread which was so good our group of 6 ended up getting 3 to share (we initially all naively thought we could just share bites of 1 - wrong).  

The sides here are good as well if you&apos;re trying to get some veggies in alongside the deep-fried goodness - the Kale salad was fresh and the dressing was pretty tasty and the coleslaw was solid, though not as memorable as the other things we ate.

Also be sure to check out the various beverage options they&apos;ve got up by the register - we were happy to see a variety of both beers and non-alcoholic beverages.","The only thing better that my top 5 food truck experiences is to have a sit down option too. Today we checked out the new location inside of the Burke Museum after attending a great play at the UW School of Drama (plug for them too!). Even though they are open until 5 on Sundays (same hours as the museum, although they have their own separate entrance) they seemed eager to close early when we arrived as the only customers at 4:35. No matter, they were friendly, took our order and in no time we were enjoying two savory fry bread tacos along with one sweet one to share. The chili verde chicken and pulled pork selections were both great, as was the honey soaked dessert. Prices were very reasonable for what amounts to a museum cafe. I can&apos;t wait to come back and try other items.","One of my favorite trucks in Seattle:

Quality: the veggie tacos are good. The fry bread is fresh and the chili is well seasoned. I would like more veggies on the veggie tacos, but they are delicious nevertheless.

Quantity: the fry bread is thick and the put enough chilli on it to make it filling. I usually buy 3, but 2 is still plenty.

Service: classic food truck service, nothing to rave or complain about

Price: $5 per taco is steep, so I get it once per month only. They are pretty pricey, so be prepared to splurge.","I&apos;m glad Off The Rez specializes in fry bread because damn, it was good and there really aren&apos;t many places that do it.  But the savory dishes seemed to be amiss. 

My friend and I spotted this food truck, as it was the truck that was parked outside of Optimism Brewery when we visited.  You always need bites with your beer; and when she found out that Off the Rez was here, she was excited to try their fry bread.  I had never eaten fry bread before, but was down to try something new. 

My friend ordered the Powwow Burger, a bacon cheeseburger with fry bread for buns, while I had two Indian tacos, one with pork and the other with chicken.  Menu was pretty standard with taco and burger combinations, with sides like kale salad and fries. 

My Indian tacos were A-OK.  Don&apos;t get me wrong - the fry bread was awesome!  It was soft and fluffy and had crispy edges.  I would&apos;ve happily just eaten it by itself.  But getting it as a taco, to sandwich the meat and toppings seemed to distract from the real winner of Off The Rez, the fry bread.  Both of my meats, chicken and pork were bland.  You&apos;d think that with the toppings it wouldn&apos;t be so, but they were.  My chicken taco included shredded cheese and slaw in a crema sauce while the pork one had a BBQ sauce with slaw and was supposed to have jalapenos, but sadly, they must&apos;ve forgot to put it on.  The sauces did help to add some flavor to the tacos, but meat just never came through.  My friend felt the same way about her Powwow Burger, saying that the beef patty tasted like it wasn&apos;t seasoned.  

I advise getting a sweet fry bread item instead of a savory dish, in hopes that it fares much better.  The fry bread was really good, so the simpler the toppings, the better.",Food was great here and service was also nice! Their Fry-bread is crispy on the outside and soft inside. Their tacos were flavorful and i highly recommend the bison tacos. My girlfriend had the rice bowl and that was also delicious. I would definitely come back here again.,"YUM! I got the carnitas, and that is some of the best meat I&apos;ve had in a long time. The slaw on top was fresh, crunchy, and matched the meats well. The chicken that my partner got was less than spectacular... but still good. I think if I started with the chicken, it would have been a lot better. Unfortunately for me, I started with the carnitas, and the flavor just blows everything else out of the water. My partner also got a lemon curd dessert fry bread and he enjoyed it. 

I want to try their burgers next! Thanks for making delicious food! It&apos;s awesome to sneak a little taste of your delicious world!","The chili is delicious. It&apos;s a bit more tomato-y than tex mex chili and has such a strong flavor profile, very well seasoned. Their fries are golden. My family adored their sweet fry bread. They have a range  from burgers to kale and quinoa salads. They also offer &quot;Indian tacos&quot; made with frybread. Check &apos;em out","The food in this cafe is remarkably delicious compared to most place you find inside of art instillations.  Usually food inside of museums etc. is overpriced and processed. I ordered the beef chili Indian taco. It was hand-crafted and well-conceived. Plus the orders came up quickly!  I rarely get over to the he UW. Campus, but now I have another reason to go.",I had the Spicy Chicken Frybread Grilled Cheese at the Grilled Cheese Grand Prix. It was very good! Such a good combination of flavors.,This place absolutely blew me . My only disappointment was not being able to eat even more beyond my stomach capacity! 10/10 on everything we are.,"Good food, good service, just needs more bison sauce on the wild rice. Fry bread is super comfort food. Got half strawberry jam and nutella. Tacos were tasty too. They should open another location with a more expansive menu and execute similar to Tocabe.","They usually sell tacos in different spots over Seattle. It&apos;s inconvenient for me to go around but luckily, they have fixed located right Burke museum in UW campus !!! Their tacos is superior. No errors in their tacos . Cooked to perfection!!","Ordered for a company&apos;s party and it was delicious! We got savory and sweet version. We got cinnamon sugar, honey, and berries jam. 
Savory we got chicken, beef, and vegetarian (beans and corn).
The pickled onions were quite good as well. 
Would recommend as a big party tray event.","I&apos;ve been a fan of Off the Rez and their delicious frybread tacos for years now. I really don&apos;t like the chicken one at all, and the beef one is okay, but the pulled pork taco is where it&apos;s at. I don&apos;t usually like barbecue sauce, but their combination of sauce and toppings is sublime.

I always felt like there was too high of a filling to bread ratio (what a problem to have, right?), but the last time I was there, they actually fixed it. It seemed like the piece of frybread was a lot bigger, and now it&apos;s absolutely perfect.

If you haven&apos;t tried their tacos yet, you need to - just make sure you get the pork.","I ordered the main entree combo that included one vegetarian papusa, one veggie taco, and one yucca (fried or boiled).

The papusa fulfilled my craving for cheesy goodness. It was much larger than papusas I&apos;ve had before, so the outer dough layer was thinner. It was stuffed with cheese and veggies and was oh so delicious and comforting.

The veggie taco was large, loaded with refried beans, tomatoes, lettuce, veggies, and white cheese. Flavor was  a bit bland but still satisfying.

I&apos;ve never had yucca before and opted for the fried version. It was like a huge thick French fry, whose taste leaned sweeter rather than starchy. Definitely satisfied carb cravings.

The entree came with a red sauce and Salvadoran slaw. The version I had at a different restaurant was crunchy and tart, so I took a huge bite of the provided container. My gosh that was spicy- I had to run for milk even with a decent spice tolerance. Eat in smaller quantities! 

Service was quick and polite and workers wore masks. 

Great place to satisfy cheesy, carby cravings!",Pupusa was delicious and large! Recommend cheese and beans with jalape√±o. Takeout came hot and tasty!,"We did a takeout order this afternoon and had it for dinner and it was fabulous! Tamales were great, pupusas full of flavor and the pastelitos filled with tasty nopal, pork, jalape√±os and cheese. We&apos;ve always enjoyed eating in, and it was just as tasty to take home. Seattle should really want places like Guanaco&apos;s to emerge as strong as possible from this pandemic shutdown. They certainly make supporting them worthwhile!","I been here a few times now and think it&apos;s pretty decent. It&apos;s located a little out of the way of the main business area.

I mostly ordered snacky type of food here so I can&apos;t say much about their main entree dish.

Fish taco - meh, for $5, definitely not worth it, one taco with a piece of fish in it and some slaw. Nothing really special and not much flavor.

Yucca - meh, nothing really special as well 

Pupusa - after ordering this for the first time, I feel like I can come here more often just for the pupusa, they are decently size and comes with a cup of slaw and cup of sauce. The nice part is that you can choose 3 different protein/veggies to put in the pupusa. It&apos;s freshly made and nice texture. This one is good and Worth the price.","We ordered takeout due to COVID-19.  The food is okay but not amazing.  I got a #4 combo and a side of plantains.  The portions look small but are surprisingly filling, and for under $15 for an entree it&apos;s a pretty good deal.  The plantains were pretty rubbery; the texture suggested they&apos;d sat under a heat lamp for a while.  Overall, this is a decent deal for how cheap it is for the area, but I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to return.",I gave it a try especially because I was craving tres leches. I ordered a takeout and then when I got home the tres leches wasn&apos;t in the bag. I called the place again and even though they said they were going to return the money back they were very insensitive about it.,"A cute spot for a casual dinner. I&apos;d never had a pupusa before but I&apos;d have to say that I&apos;m a fan. Parking is on the street and you may have to walk around the building to find the entrance. There&apos;s quite a few spots that are in the same building and the location is a little confusIng on google maps. 
I tried the pork, cheese, and beans put pupusa. You get 3 fillings and have to pay extra for more fillings. It comes with a side of pickled veggies and red and green salsa on the tables. Utensils and water are self serve. If you need a container grab that too. The hostess at the register was very helpful with choosing what to order.",Papusas are hard to come by in Seattle so I&apos;m v grateful that I found this yummy place! Loved the corn tamal as well. Wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the tres leches cake but the plantains made up for it.,"I was a bit surprised at the cost of about $5.50 a pupusa, as they are usually small, but these were quite large- almost the size of a dinner plate. Fillings are mostly vegetarian for the pupusas and I got a couple with beans and cheese.  Small restaurant, you could see and hear the woman making them in the back. Next time I&apos;m trying the plantains too!","So. Good. My family ordered way too much food and somehow managed to eat all of it anyways. I&apos;m a vegetarian, so I got the cheese/refried bean pupusa and vegetarian pastelito. We also got the bu√±uelos en miel for dessert, which were also super good!",Probably the worst pupusas I have ever had. The rice flower pupusas were soggy and undercooked. The side of rice was hard and severely undercooked and the refr√≠ed beans tasted like they were out of a can.,"I happen to be staying at a dorm directly across the street from Guanaco&apos;s and I wasn&apos;t going to leave Seattle without giving it a try. I&apos;ve had my fair share of pupusas over the years and definitely know what I like. Although the menu here is Americanized, the flavors are authentic if you make it. (I&apos;m not sure about adding spinach to your pupusas but whatever works!). I had a classic combo of cheese and chicharron and it was no surprise that the pupusas came out great. I had one of regular masa de maiz and one with harina de arroz (my favorite!). 

I am also impressed by the speed at which the dishes came out. Don&apos;t misunderstand; it&apos;s not that they were super fast; it&apos;s just that in every one of my past experiences at pupuserias, I&apos;ve always waited until near starvation before the food came out. Not the case here at all.","This food was ok. I have only had papusas once before and maybe they were particularly good, but the ones I had at Guanaco&apos;s seemed a little blander than I expected. I can say the exact same thing about Horchata. I&apos;ve had it (a couple times) at one other place and it&apos;s better, but what I got at Guanaco&apos;s was passable. All in all it was affordable and tasted alright, so I will probably order again, but it won&apos;t be my first choice.",They messed up my order and gave me banana fry instead of tres leches. The chicken thighs came with thick small tortillas. They gave tomatillo sauce instead of habanero. The guac was good and the delivery was quick is all,"Went to get their combos. They&apos;re lacking in so many areas, the pupusa is bland, the yuca smelled spoiled and was not crispy, it was soggy. We found a hair in the yuca. I&apos;ve had authentic Salvadorean food, and they are definitely far from it. Will not go back. Waste of $30.","Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing but their horchata and street tacos were just bad. Objectively below average and not worth the price at all. 

Taco was small, chicken was dry and not much flavor and no sauce in it, can&apos;t believe they are charging over three dollars for each. Horchata was just sweet water tasting with this sandy lumpy sediment at the bottom. Hygiene of the place also  concerned me - every condiment on the table was sticky and old looking, the table was also sticky. The utensils also had old food stuck to them.","I was in town on business and found this place online while looking for cheap eats in Seattle.

We each ordered a sampler platter: One Pupusa And One Taco Of Your Choice, Rice And Choice Of Black, Pinto Or Refried Beans - because for $7.50 it sounded great.  However, they charged us $5 more for each plate.  $12.95 instead of $7.50 each.  (We called in the order so we didn&apos;t notice the discrepancy until we were long gone.)  The price shows up as $7.95 on their website: https://guanacostacos.weebly.com/menu.html, and $7.50 on a Google search.  Either way, well less than the $12.95 that they charged us.

Price issue aside, the food was pretty good.  The pupusa was the best - we had meat, bean and cheese in ours and they were delicious.  The rice was under cooked, and the beans were soupy.  I just mixed them together and it was good enough.  The taco was like a taco truck taco, and good too.","Gonna be honest, I love this place! Being a fellow worker within the food business it saddens me a bit to see people review this shop with such complaints, especially because some problems can be fixed via phone call. This place is consistently god and I&apos;ve never had an issue with the employees. I also appreciate that they don&apos;t assume I need plastic utensils as they can be so wasteful! 15/10 you :,)","Didn&apos;t feel welcomed at all when picking up my food. Maybe she was having a bad day? But I would appreciate acknowledgement. Once she handed me my food I noticed she handed it to me with the box wide open inside the bag. I got back with my food there was no fork or napkin and which is pretty crucial when ordering food to-go. Seems like she wanted me out of there. Now with my food I ordered pork and cheese papusa, I got a cheese papusa with very little pork. I&apos;m not one to write reviews but I was very disappointed with my trip to this place, especially since it&apos;s my first time here. With all of that being said, the food is good just not the customer service or menu. If you order a pork and cheese papusa and you only get cheese, don&apos;t be surprised.","Came here a couple of times and this place does not disappoint.  The burritos, tacos, and pupuseria are all divinely tasty and delicious.  The food comes pretty fast so a nice place to lunch or break from work.

Def a must visit in University District.","This the best tacos in Seattle area! The taco comes with chicken, cilantro and lime. Their chicken is so awesome and delicious. Its a very authentic tacos. Their price is also affordable and worth it with good quality.

Their bowl and burrito are also great! They don&apos;t even charge me extra when I asked to add lettuce into my bowl. 

The ladies are friendly and nice. They always give me good service. This place could be busy and has long lines during rush hour like dinner time.","I&apos;ve driven past Rancho Bravo approximately six bazillion times in my life, but only recently started stopping there. This little taco shop, which only offers window service and outdoor seating (so button up if you go!) is dishing out the Mexican food goodness. Both times I&apos;ve gone lately I ordered the chica burrito with chicken. This is a smaller version of their large, mission-style burrito and great if you have a smaller appetite or just don&apos;t want to down a football-sized burrito in one sitting. And at just around $4 it&apos;s got to be one of the better lunch values in the big city.

Rancho Bravo is great for takeout, too. You can order ahead and your food will be ready. I recently ordered a burrito, tacos, sides, and chips and it was ready in about five minutes!","Ordered Rancho Bravo for delivery so don&apos;t have the experience of seeing the place for myself, but I thought that the burrito I got was quite tasty.  The carnitas was tender, and the flour tortilla was perfectly carby and buttery.

On the other hand, we also got a chicken salad that was just okay.  There wasn&apos;t anything special about it and seemed quite smaller than other taco salads we get as nearby &quot;take out&quot; type places.  I much prefer the taco salad at Gorditos in Greenwood, for example.

The hot sauce was really good, and very hot.  Again, this place gets 4 stars from me because I liked the burrito, but if it was any less tasty than I thought it was I would have given it 3 stars.  pricing wasn&apos;t bad, but not great for what you get either.","Hands down, best burrito in Seattle!!! 

My husband and I have been going here for years! I felt like I needed to leave a review for it since we&apos;ve been going here for so long. Since before we were married and while we attended the UW nearby in fact. 

Whenever I think of &quot;burrito cravings&quot;, I immediately think of the Rancho Bravo Burrito! It&apos;s change a little over the years, but always solid, and reliably good! 

Value is amazing and you will definitely be full. We&apos;ve also had the tacos and tamales there-- soooo yummy! But my fave will always be the Rancho Bravo burrito! Get it!!!","I had been coming here for years but saw something very disturbing today. The person in front of me brought in gluten free tortillas from home. My nephew is celiac so I understand.  However, The cashier took the plastic bag from her, set it on the counter where they were wrapping food, and a minute later pulled five or six large tortillas out of the bag and put them all over the grill.  They left the bag the lady brought on the counter and never cleaned it as they wrapped other people&apos;s food.  Perhaps this coronavirus is nothing to be concerned about, but I&apos;m not going to risk coming here again with there current sanitation practices.  

Update:  This is still a very unsafe place to eat, do it at your own risk!","I lived in SoCal for a couple of years and I&apos;ve visited Mexico a number of times, so I feel like I have a good handle on good Mexican food.

Before I get into the review I wanted to share a quick observation I&apos;ve made time and again. I&apos;ve eaten around the globe, literally, also, having lived in a number of big US cities, figuratively in said cities international neighborhoods. One mistake I see made time and again is when people try to order something that looks &quot;familiar&quot; or they have misplaced expectations. Every time I see this happen and I get the chance to hear feedback on aforementioned experience, it&apos;s generally not good.

Now, in saying that, this is not Pecado Bueno, which quite frankly is some of the worst TexMex I&apos;ve eaten in anywhere. No, PB is not Mexican food, sorry not sorry. Nor is Rancho Bravo some sit down Mexican restaurant. Rancho Bravo is, what I would classify as, Mexican street food, it just so happens to be made in a brick &amp; mortar and has parking.

If you are looking for some very, very good Mexican food for a ridiculously reasonable price, then RBT on 45th is where you want to eat. I&apos;ve eaten here more times than I can count on both hands in the past two years and have never had a poor experience... except for them being out of lingua one or two times I really wanted it, haha. Also, the three salsas they have are exactly what I&apos;m looking for when chowing down on a tortas and tamales.

Bonus, the ladies who work here are super friendly and I&apos;ve heard them be very accommodating to people who have come through placing orders with rather specific dietary restrictions, within reason of course.","The venue is not a restaurant- the kitchen is inside, and there is a tent outside with some tables and condiments within. Great for the summer, but better to take it home in the winter.

The food came out pretty quick. I ordered a torta with spicy pork. It was delicious. Especially the bread. I have no clue how they made the bread, but it was great. And the spicy pork inside was also delicious.

The two ladies working in the kitchen were also nice and tolerated my terrible attempts at Spanish.

Would definitely come back.",Love the food but won&apos;t go back.  My order was made incorrectly and when my husband went back with it to get it correctly made they argued with him even with receipt in hand.  They did remake it but it was still not 100% correct.  I&apos;m sorry but they were not that busy and  I&apos;m not going back when he had to basically yell to get what we paid for in the first place.,"As a California native, I love burritos. Having lived in Seattle for years now, I decided to finally search for the best burrito spots in the area. This is my Seattle Burrito Quest.

I love all types of burritos but the type I grew up with was Mission style. And with a quick search, Rancho Bravo seems to be one of the few Mission style burrito joints in the area, so of course I had to give them a try.

I ordered a bravo burrito with lengua. Is it just me or do places in Seattle not typically sell lengua? It&apos;s definitely my go to meat in a mission burrito. When I got the order, the first thing I saw was the aluminum foil - good sign. Then I pulled it out of the bag and saw the burrito was dilapidated, rolled such that it was filling heavy on one side, kind of like a cone. I had to be very careful eating it so that it didn&apos;t completely fall apart.

Flavor-wise this was actually pretty good. The meat was very tender and the flavors were all there. I think if the rice had a bit more punch to offer and if they used a bit less sour cream this would be great. Ultimately, even though it tasted good, the whole point of a burrito is to be able to easily hold and eat your food, and the poor wrapping will drag this place&apos;s score down. Maybe that was a one-off? I will likely be back and I can update this review if my experience is different.

Thanks for reading, and I&apos;m off to the next burrito in my Seattle Burrito Quest.",$2.50 each small tacos and a grapefruit jarritos. I enjoy their carn√© asada and al pastor tacos. You&apos;ll usually get your food in about 5 minutes.,"Consistently good grub and sincere service. We walked over on a sunny evening and shared a bowl of carnitas nachos, eating outside under the tent. They provide like four different types of salsas, a rag to wipe off the table, napkins and utensils. The nachos were wonderful and exactly as you might expect, but better. It&apos;s perfect food to satisfy a salty-spicy-hardy mexican food craving, and a great portion size for the price!
I&apos;ve also had the rice and bean bowl here before. I love taking advantage of the outdoor seating, even in cold weather. The service is always straightforward and friendly with me. This place is definitely one of the best mexican cuisine joints in the area.",I love the food and the women who are usually running making it happen. It&apos;s my go-to for Mexican food.,"The college student who introduced to me to this place sometimes craves it, as it is plenty of volume for a reasonable price and an ok taste.

FOOD: 2.5 stars. We both had a Rancho Burrito with chicken and black beans. Filled us both up. 

SERVICE: 3.5 stars. Prompt and friendly.

AMBIANCE: 1.5 stars. Former Winchells, and the faded Winchells sign still towers above the building. Small unattractive outdoor eating area - we got takeout.","Probably the worse Mexican restaurant I have ever been too
Save your money go to Taco Bell 
I am surprised I am not throwing up
But the people are very nice","The food is awesome! The service is good. They have their own parking lot on a busy street so, that&apos;s all cool.  The area to eat is a little messy kinda like plastic picnic tables with foldable chairs under a tent open on one end. Try the bravo burrito muy Bueno",Like with pizza i am allways on the quest for good tacos by the looks of this place it looked  Promising I will one asada and one lingua the linqua was ok but not clened very well but just ok the asada was  Gross had to throw it away ladies at the counter  Were very nice but wont go back because were not very good,"Decided to break tradition by not eating at Issian, TNT Taqueria or Dick&apos;s along the main drag on N 45th in Wallingford. Had to catch the last rays of sunshine with my iced Zoka mocha after work and an architectural meeting.

First visit ever to Rancho Bravo Tacos in Wallingford. Parking spot out front, dining solo al fresco, and they take debit cards, good so far.

Tried the large steak quesadilla...quite a bit more substantial than TNT&apos;s version. Sat at the table which had large containers of the &apos;red&apos; and &apos;green&apos; sauce. Spicy, cheesy, meaty goodness, and didn&apos;t care that I couldn&apos;t feel my lips. Brief flashback to Jorge who enjoyed seeing me sweat through family meal back in my restaurant days. Amazingly, I scarfed that entire serving. Satisfying dinner!

Sorted my stuff...compost, recycle and trash. No dishes to wash, got some sunshine after yesterday&apos;s deluge, and now a mocha and quesadilla co-mingling in my stomach.

Life is good.","A hidden diamond in the ruff, very inexpensive for large portions. Delicious food as well!","First time there. I ordered a Carne Asada Torta and an Al Pastor taco. It&apos;s how Mexican food should be reasonably priced. This isn&apos;t 5 star dining. Eat in the tent or get it to go. The food comes out quickly. 
I&apos;m unsure if the torta bread is buttered but damn it had this soft crunch to it. Packed with meat and jalape√±os but the heat wasn&apos;t over powering. And my Al Pastor taco, so tender and the tortillas were so fresh. 
I can&apos;t wait to go back.","1 star for being perpetrators. 
I&apos;m surprised because almost no one in there speaks english. Had me thinking authenticity awaits 
This food is offensive and I&apos;m not even Spanish. I&apos;m so done because I stopped here thinking- great, Seattle finally has some culture. WRONG !!!
This is a tasteless ass rip off. I highly doubt there is any Mexican with culture or any other South Americans that would come &amp; eat here &amp; be pleased. It&apos;s for yuppies &amp; gringo that do not know any better.

They get you with the homemade Aguas .... lies. It&apos;s watery &quot;horchata&quot; obviously made with water very little milk powder with cinnamon &amp; sugar. Ridicuat the $4 drink of cloudy water. 

The enchiladas were cold corn tortillas open faced I ass sitting on top of beans ( choice of black or pinto) &amp; gummy rice with some Luke warm enchilada sauce from a can poured over with some garnish of lettuce and onions with some Parmesan cheese they are passing off as cojeta . 

The street taco was blasphemous at a whopping $3.50 after tax. I had what they are referring to as carne asada is rubbery flavorless steak


This whole experience was a expensive lesson that didn&apos;t result in a full belly. 

Lastly, I was disgusted to watch a little girl who was watching an iPad in the kitchen move to the crowd outside touching everything in her path as most five year olds do. &amp; the. Make her way into the kitchen sans washing her hands into the main kitchen to prepare the salsa cups to be filled with wet, cold mixtures, the perfect breeding ground for any type of bacteria from that little girls hands. So disappointed. 


My advice is don&apos;t be fooled. Stay away save yourself $, food poisoning and attitude","I love this little spot! I like to go here once a week and I have never been disappointed. My favorite thing is the tazones- they separate the meat/beans/rice from the lettuce/cold parts when you do take out so it&apos;s not a soggy mess. I wish the salsas were a little spicier, but that&apos;s my own preference. 
The staff is super nice, I&apos;m always greeted with a smile and they&apos;re super on top of everything. 

The absolute cherry on top is how good their churros are. Love yourself. Get a churro. Get a dozen churros. Go wild.",Walk up and Take out fast service and good quality close to Authentic Mexican Tacos....3 Carne Asada Tacos 9.79 expensive but tasty,"This has been a hint of mine for years since moving to Seattle. Finding a good taqueria with flavorful meats and delicious tacos has been hard. Many of the places are Americanized and are bland, and tough meats. Finally I found the place. 

I&apos;d like to start and say this is really pricey which is one of the reasons for 1 less star, but with the corona virus going on I have to appreciate that they are trying to stay open and make accommodations. 

I got the taco plate which was $11, over 12.50 with tax, something I would usually pay $9 for, but still worth it. The carne asada tacos were juicy and flavorful with an interesting spin of shredded radishes on top. I will now be putting that on all my tacos. The beans and salsa were absolutely delicious. I believe I had the salsa verde as well as their habanero which I think was sweetened with carrots. The only negative thing besides the price was the rice, which was slightly bland. 

I definitely recommend eating here.
Happy Eating!","Gosh, it sucks that this place is as bad as it is, because you really want to like this place. It&apos;s dying to be called authentic: it&apos;s got the Spanish word in its name, it&apos;s got the vibrant yellow walls, the TV playing soccer, etc., but the taste is simply not there. My last two burritos there were some of the most tasteless things I&apos;ve ever eaten. My beans tasted like crayons and my chicken was like thawed chicken cubes kept at the International Space Station. 

Even the easy wins - like good customer service - aren&apos;t there. You think you&apos;re going to get this sweet family-owned customer service, but it&apos;s like a UW chemistry junior snubbing you one extra container of habanero. 

Lastly, a can of soda there is $2.50. What else do you need to know?","I&apos;ve been wanting to try this place for a few months, so I was so excited to finally go. Unfortunately, I was kind of disappointed. I ordered the al pastor tacos, and they were not packaged well. They were put inside a container with two tacos on the bottom and one stacked on top. Even though I kept the container upright, the taco contents were all over the place. They were a pretty messy to eat and everything was oily. 

One of my friends ordered salsa and didn&apos;t get it in her order. My other friend ordered a torta and churro, but her order didn&apos;t include the churro. The business was accommodating about refunding her when she called back, but it was surprising that so many things got left out of our orders. Also, I had a fork and napkin with my tacos, but my friend didn&apos;t. It didn&apos;t seem like much care was put into packing the to-go orders. 

I value flavor over presentation, but even that wasn&apos;t impressive. The tacos were good and satisfied my Mexican food craving, but they don&apos;t make me excited about going back. I wish there was more flavor and freshness. Overall I don&apos;t have anything super negative to say about the food, but the lack of care put out into preparing our orders was off-putting.",Chefs/person in the kitchen mask was slipping. Extremely disappointed. Sogged out rice aswell.,Not the best to-go tacos - they must have dropped the order and not said anything. The taco contents were all over the inside of the container. They also forgot the included salsa . . . not stoked.,"I have eaten here often because I like al pastor, but to be honest, many of those times I&apos;m at least a little disappointed. For example, today, they just left all of the toppings out of the burrito! Even one I requested extra (and paid extra for)! It wouldn&apos;t be such a bit deal if the food weren&apos;t so expensive. Anyway, it has filled the burrito hole in my life, but today may be my last burrito from here.",I got a carne asada tostone and everything was great about my experience.  The carne asada was made from quality meat and had perfect texture and flavor. The rice and beans were tasty and romaine was fresh. The pico de gallo had just the right amount of lime. It even came with crispy homemade style chips. The tostone made for a filling and delicious meal!,Best breakfast burritos around.  Good tacos but small and not  cheap the churros are amazing.  Order ahead because they aren&apos;t super fast and can get busy.  The avocado crema is delicious as is the salsa verde. Haven&apos;t tried the breakfast platters yet but can&apos;t wait to.,"This place pretty fire ngl, solid menu options and give you good sized portions. I will say their breakfast menu is lacking flavor, but their lunch menu is great. Here is a burrito for your viewing pleasure. Tasted great","Delicious!  I Like it, I Love it, I want some more of it!!! 

We Ordered the breakfast burrito with papas dulce which is sweet potato, eggs, kale with Pico. Yum! 

The Chiliqules is pretty legit too &amp; you can also add meats (I think).

I&apos;ll be back to try one of everything please!

You KNOW it&apos;s good when a chick from Bellevue (who NEVER) crosses the bridge for Mexican food! And we did, Guilty!!! Three times in 1 week...3 al pastor taco platter, hominey &amp; spinich hash tazone, carnita tazone, chicken Quesadilla, chips, salsa, guac, churro!!! 

I mean, we&apos;ve searched high and low for the taqueria we can make our &quot;go to&quot; and we might have found it! TNT-TNT!!! Da Bomb homey!","Yelp!!! You did me wrong. Thought I&apos;d switch things up from my usual taco places and try TNT. Got a plate of al pastor tacos, so disappointing. Flavor was nonexistent, meat was extra fatty and the tortillas soggy. No thanks. I tossed the last one even though I was starving. To add to it, when I opened the to go container, looked like someone had shaken it a few times with the complete mess that the food was in.","Being from LA, home to quite possibly the best tasty tacos and taco trucks on the planet, I&apos;m always skeptical of the local taco action here in Seattle or anywhere when it comes to tacos. But, I stopped into TNT the other day to check out their tasty tacos for &quot;Taco Tuesday&quot;, which sadly up here nobody gets into .Anyway, I grabbed one test taco and it was pretty tasty, so I grabbed three more and a bottle of Mexican Coke. They survived the trip back to my pad pretty well, and I scarfed &apos;em down. And, by-cracky they were some tasty tacos, so I&apos;ll definitely chow there again!",Good find in Seattle.  The Carne asade is more like small chunks of beef but flavor is good. Got the breakfast taquitos are good and large sized.  Tacos are good. The Al Pastor is flavorful and again good amount of food. Overall it is a good find. If I&apos;m in the area I would come back,"Their walk up window is perfect right now, and I&apos;m mildly obsessed with their breakfast burritos.","Do yourself a favor and get a plate of al pastor tacos with the avocado crema and salsa verde!! I would go almost weekly when I lived in the area. A bit pricey but really worth it. Definitely prefer TNT to Chukis. Both are good but personally, I think the quality and variety is just superior here. You can really tell they put a lot of effort into their cooking. The space is small and there&apos;s minimal seating but I would gladly stand in a rainstorm for the food.

Did I mention they have hot fresh churros??","A hoppin&apos; little spot,
with festive decor.
Service was quick,
To bring me the chorizo burrito I adore!",I&apos;ve been going here since I moved to the neighborhood a few years ago. Great food at reasonable prices. The homemade salsas are great! They recently add online ordering,"I bought the salad one. It&apos;s okay, but not that amazing. Definitely gonna give another chance to try burritos next time. Hope it will be good.","I used to live in Ravenna and this site was a long time Pizza Hut, then transformed into another indie pizza site, and now currently The Counter at Old Ballard Catering located at 15th and 65th. I ordered takeout back on 9/22/20. I recall how kind and welcoming one of the catering owners was going through their menu with me. 

I ended up ordering the Carnitas Street Tacos with chips and salsa ($10) and the Chicken Strips with dipping sauces and Lemon Pepper Chips ($10). For the amazing quality and generous servings, these are a steal versus other restaurants serving similar entrees.

Definitely a useful pro tip, go through their menu, complete and pay for an online order. They are pretty popular and their tiny parking lot fills up fast at this busy intersection.

Quality food and a solid business model, no surprise they continue to thrive and receive praise during the pandemic.","Joann was very welcoming when I walked in their store.  She was helpful with my billing request.  Took care of me right away.
Food was ready for pickup 
I had beef lamb gyro and fries.  Very very DELICIOUS!!!!!  This is the first time I&apos;ve tried their food.  I highly recommend it!!!  Very clean place too.  I&apos;ll definitely do more takeouts from THE COUNTER...and will recommend this place to all my friends and neighbors...it&apos;s so convenient just walking distance from my place.   Please thank your Chef!!!  Super delicious gyro and fries!!!","Just ordered the best beef/lamb gyro from here and it was exactly what I wanted. The meat was ample and tender, flavorfully balanced with the freshness of the Mediterranean salsa, which includes marinated cherry tomatoes and cucumbers with crunchy lettuce and zingy, but sweet pickled red onions. All these things danced perfectly with a creamy mild tzatisiki sauce and crumbled feta, wrapped in fluffy pita bread. Perfection. I also got a side avgolemeno soup (basically creamy chicken and rice soup, greek style) and it was simple and deliciously comforting. I also got a few bites of my partner&apos;s chicken strips and lemon pepper chips and they were very tasty, we&apos;ll have to come back next Friday for Fried Chicken! It was easy to order online (cheap bloody mary&apos;s on Sun, $5!), and pick up was friendly and easy.","The wife and I ordered fish n chips from there for dinner this evening.  Online ordering was super easy, and they said that the meal would be ready at 430.  I drove up and parked at 429, and as I walked in, I could see the meals being bagged up.  I walked in, the person at the counter handed me the bag and off I went to get home.  

Quite honestly, it might have been the best fish n chips I&apos;ve had in Seattle!  Both the wife and I were impressed on how crispy the fish and the chips were despite eating our meals 20 minutes after picking them up.  Great sized portions, and it was not greasy at all!  

We&apos;re excited to try other things on the menu!","Initially I was looking to try something else food wise here, but When I was looking over the menu and saw they had wings, I just so happened to be in the mood.
I&apos;ve been looking for a wing place for some time now and so far everything has been ok. I was really just taking a chance. And let me tell you. Worth it.

Chicken: cooked evenly, good size, good quantity, no extra breading
Flavor: Buffalo is generally not my personal go to, but it&apos;s the standard to try. Really good flavor, more of a spicy kick than I was anticipating (but I&apos;m not mad about it)
Sides: couple celery sticks
Price: slightly more expensive than at a dive bar or typical wing spot, but I think it&apos;s worth the quality

I&apos;ll definitely come back for wings when I&apos;m craving it, but should probably look into the rest of their menu too!","I have been here a couple times now for burgers on Wednesdays. I am also a fan of their fries - though make sure you get home immediately to eat them otherwise they lose their crispness in the closed box. The fried chicken on Fridays is sooooo good, sides are also great especially the Mama Lil&apos;s potato salad. They are so friendly! Love this addition to the neighborhood!","Great lunch and dinner spot!  The food is delicious and at a fair price especially given how generous the servings are.  The fried chicken was so nicely seasoned and crispy and nice and juicy.  It tasted like it was brined with Italian seasonings like oregano.  The tacos were also nice and tender with the right balance of fat and flavor.  We also got their house made chips which were perfect and their ultra cheesy mac and cheese.

Totally worth the money.  Things sell out quickly so it&apos;s best to order ahead","In total agreement with others that OBCC is such a welcome addition to the neighborhood! My first experience was their Fried Chicken Friday special a few months ago, and it got my Southern-raised BF&apos;s stamp of approval. I&apos;m not a fried chicken expert (only if it&apos;s the Korean variety), but he said it was the perfect rendition of buttermilk fried chicken.

Today, my chicken strip craving led me here and they were delightful! TRUST that these are better than any chicken strips you&apos;ve ever had. They&apos;re texturally perfect all around and you can tell they&apos;re made with care. I have a big appetite but the portion was more than generous, and the fries were just perfect.

I love that they have rotating specials and curated drinks/treats--this place has character and charm, and I&apos;m all for it! The owner is also super sweet!",Delicious food! Fun drink options :) clearly they love cooking and are committed to freshness.,"The Counter has become a pandemic staple for us - we get takeout from them at least once a week. The menu is varied, the quality is excellent, ordering is easy and the pickup process is the best we&apos;ve had in these many months of supporting local restaurants. When you arrive you can see through the front door if your bag is waiting for you (they&apos;re always on time, but never cold) and just pop in and grab it.

We&apos;ve tried most things on the menu. Our favorites are the Wednesday night burgers, the carnitas taco, the Mama Lil&apos;s potato salad (so good) and the pork gyro. We always add a Caesar salad to share and they&apos;re huge. 

This is a great example of a neighborhood spot that&apos;s adapting well to the pandemic.","We are so glad to have discovered this amazing gem on grubhub and ubereats.   We now order from here every week.   The food is delicious and fresh.  Portions are very generous.   Amazing customer service.   Really good prices for the quality and quantity of food.    The food is packaged very well,  with food safety seal.   Really appreciate that!

Highly recommend these dishes:
1.  Beef/Lamb Gyros - the best I&apos;ve had.   Meat is very juicy and nicely seasoned, the pita is thick and fresh, the dressings are very fresh and yummy  :  love the pickled onions, salsa is slightly spicy, tzatziki is mild and creamy, feta is generous.  I would order extra meat, it&apos;s worth it! 

2.  Buffalo Chicken wings - spicy and absolutely delicious.   Not greasy.   The sauce is what makes it so good.   Generous celery portions.   My son finished it in 10 minutes!

3.  Fried Chicken Strips - the best I&apos;ve ever had.   The chicken is authentic (not plumped up, tastes fresh and real), the breading is seasoned perfectly, crispy, just the right ration of breading to chicken, absolutely not greasy.   We usually purchase the 1 pounder (large size) and it is generous and feeds 3 people generously.

4.  Potato Salad - it is spicy, not like any potato salad I&apos;ve had, very addictive.  Potatoes perfectly cooked.   Spicy though!

5.  Mac and Cheese - very good, repeat order.

6.  Fries are thick, perfectly seasoned (not to salty), just enough grease as expected with fried.  

7.  Chocolate chip cookie - soft, chewy, fresh, clearly homemade

We also ordered the following, they are average, you may enjoy it more than we did, depending on your taste palette:
1.  cole slaw is fresh but bland
2.  chicken nuggets - better than fast food, but you don&apos;t get a lot for $10, but if you like typical nuggets (where you don&apos;t get a lot of meat, but you get that special breading), these are fine
3.  Athens Gyro (with the roast pork) it&apos;s ok if you like pork, the beef and lamb is so much better","Wonderful take out experience! Kids had mac n cheese, tacos for us parents with a side of strawberry margarita. We loved it all and so thankful we decided to get the cookies to bake at home.

Service was very friendly and covid precautions made me feel very safe.","We are so stoked these guys decided to set up shop in our neighborhood!  The food (available for lunch &amp; dinner) has really been exceptional.  Still trying to work through everything on their menu, but so far everything has been top notch in terms of quality, flavor, and value.  

Because they are a catering company too, they offer a nice variety of food options.  They have a Greek menu, taco offerings, and some really great fried chicken.  They also a small smattering of pantry items, and a good selection of beer and other drinks.  

Anyway, thrilled to have them around.  Hoping the word spreads and these guys enjoy the great business they deserve!","Great carry out addition to the Roosevelt/ Ravenna neighborhood. Caught them on opening day, and have probably ordered at least a dozen times since then. They offer a wide variety of &quot;comfort&quot; foods - we&apos;ve ordered tacos, gyros, chicken, and a couple weekly specials. My wife&apos;s favorite is the tacos, while I think their chicken strips are some of the best fried chicken I have ever tasted. Chicken strips are available every day, while they do normal fried chicken on Fridays only. 

Their experience with catering shows - food items are all well-packaged and labeled. Orders have always been ready for pickup at the promised time, the food is hot, and the wait times are very good for made-to-order meals. 

Have recommended The Counter to a number of neighbors, and feedback has been very good. As others have noted, the owners are extremely friendly and personable - they&apos;ve even met Pepe, my green cheeked conure! Glad to have them in the neighborhood!","Amazing food by amazingly nice people. They even have dog treats outside! Masks are required, and the safety protocol seemed particularly tight here. We ordered a Greek salad with herb chicken, the jerk chicken special, and a strawberry margarita (booze with food orders only, btw). All were FANTASTIC and the portions are so huge (including the margarita), it will be two meals or you&apos;re Dwayne Johnson-sized. 

A bright spot in a dark time, for sure.","THESE GUYS KNOW HOW TO COOK SOME CHICKEN! Man, oh man, it is good!  Super moist chicken, flavorful fry... so tender, the chicken tenders almost fall apart when you are eating them.  Wondering if there might be some sous vide magic going on here.  Mama Lil&apos;s Potato Salad is 12/10!  Great paired with chicken, as well, if you like a little spice in your life!  Tzatziki was also super fresh and yummy.  Exceeded expectations; excited to try more on the menu.  Ooo that chicken!","First off... THE OWNERS ARE SO SO NICE. I&apos;d just go in to say hi if I were to walk past here every day. I literally walked back into the store after I ate my meal down the street to tell her that I enjoyed everything we ordered.

Now for the food:
- fried chicken Fridays -- DON&apos;T SLEEP ON THIS, IT&apos;S AMAZING
- chicken strips -- ALSO PROBABLY THE BEST I&apos;VE HAD
- beef &amp; lamb gyro -- they stack this thing with a lot of meat and some tasty tzatziki sauce and some fresh veggies. Really good!
- shrimp tacos and carnitas tacos -- enjoyed the shrimp tacos slightly more and their chips/salsa are always delicious

AGAIN. Please support this business! It&apos;s owned by the sweetest siblings and they&apos;ll answer any questions and make recommendations where you need them. JUST TRUST THEM.","We have only had the fried chicken and the chicken strips (plus sides of Mama Lil&apos;s potato salad, fries, and coleslaw), but we are hooked!  Based on this, we are so excited to try the rest of the menu!  Their chicken is among the best we have ever had, and we LOVE fried chicken... so we have had many kinds.  It is so crispy and flavorful, it is just perfect!  If they ever make a spicy version, we would be ALL over it!  

We feel so blessed that they are in our neighborhood now, and look forward to more wonderful meals!  During this pandemic, they are a ray of light, and make staying home a little bit easier.","What a pleasant surprise! To be honest, I was a bit skeptical when I saw this place open, thinking it was just some catering company serving leftover box lunches. Boy was I wrong! The food was amazing- I had the Jaegerschnitzel special, which came with a side of the best red cabbage I&apos;ve ever had. The breading was perfectly crispy and they served the gravy in a separate container to keep the cutlet from getting soggy. Maybe even better than the food was the service. I have to assume the woman who helped me was the owner, because you never see regular employees so friendly, helpful, and genuinely excited to have a new customer (and if she isn&apos;t an owner, I might just have to start my own business and hire her because any business with employees like that is bound to be successful!). Do yourself a favor, stop by and support a local business with fantastic food served by great people.","Just earlier today, my roommate Oliver and I were fucking starving when we decided on The Counter At Old Ballard And Catering. Boy were we glad we did because the chicken was incredible and the breading was amazing and the fish tacos were delectable. Thank you Ioanna for taking our order and serving us much appreciated. Wonderful food.","I&apos;m not really into Mexican food but let me tell ya, the Carne Asada Plato here was 10/10. I&apos;d definitely recommend trying this place out, it was highly recommended by my coworker so we ordered lunch from here. 

The beef was juicy, had little bits of fat, seasoned well, and was smokey. The rice was seasoned and cooked perfectly, as well as the beans. The avocados and tomatoes added a fresh touch to the plate so I could keep eating! They also gave me a side of tortillas so I could make my own tacos. 

Because of COVID-19, our office is closed so I&apos;m dreaming of the day I can order from this place again!!","I had driven past their location by Home Depot on Aurora, but had never stopped. I didn&apos;t know what I was missing...

So far, I have had three varieties of tacos and their breakfast burrito with chorizo. Everything has been excellent with very generous portion sizes. 

Biggest challenge is reading the menu - old eyes and social distancing makes things tough, particularly because they have a lot of options - both menu items and meat options. I strongly recommend using their web site to study the menu and make your choices in advance. 

I would recommend that El Camion post a full page summary of the meat options by the order window, for us easily confused gringos who can&apos;t keep track of the three (!) different pork options... 

At any rate, I only recently discovered El Camion, but I am already hooked!","Wow - best shrimp tacos I&apos;ve had in a while! Ordered for pickup and it was ready super fast and amazing. I got shrimp tacos and the side of rice and beans. The rice and beans were really good too, although the container leaked a little bit (not a huge problem, I was able to put the container and my plate of tacos on another plate to minimize the mess). My boyfriend got a burrito and has ordered from here many times, and loves it every time. Definitely ordering from here again!","Customer experience was super poor. The guy in the front was rude, I tipped nicely- no thanks, or appreciation. The shrimp weren&apos;t deveined and appeared to be preheated. Rice and beans smelled like old water. Not sure if this was a bad night but I&apos;m disappointed. The one thing that was solid was the horchata. I will never eat there again, which sucks because it&apos;s down the block from me :(

Still no response from owners. What a wack establishment. I will never come here again.",I feel three stars is fair for mediocre Mexican food and rude behavior. I intended to tip in cash and when I wrote zero on the debit card transaction the attitude completely changed. This was my second visit in hope to give them a second chance from not having such a great first experience. I will not be returning for a third.,"As someone who is constantly in the neighborhood, I had to check this place out. Not only is the staff super friendly but also have my order now down as I&apos;m a regular and remember my name. Now that makes me want to come back! I&apos;ve tried most things on the menu and almost everything I&apos;ve tried I have liked. The portions are really big for the cost as well. Delmar is also great and even told me my next meal would be on him if I didn&apos;t like his reccomendation.","We have never had bad food or a bad experience at el cami√≥n, until yesterday, where (the food was still great!) but the guy taking our order was on another level... and not in a good way. He was abrasive about how we ordered, shook his head when we asked for certain things (maybe his sense of humor but it did not land well), and argued with us about the drink we ordered, saying it wasn&apos;t a thing &amp; we were wrong, even though we were staring at it on the menu board. When we picked up our food our salsas weren&apos;t in there, which he said was our fault, he told us not to order them at the beginning. Not a fun experience. I&apos;d recommend the sand point location, they are so lovely!","Since we saw the truck across from BOL and down the street from Whole Foods we knew we would be ordering take out a lot! They haven&apos;t updated their website for this location yet. We had to do some searching for the phone number.. service is fast, food is great, and the wait is normal is busy. You might have to ask for salsa when picking up as they don&apos;t added it. They do have a tent set up for the waiting area but no seating.",El Camion has been a favorite of mine for years and this location is no exception! My go-to is the Huevos con Chirizo burrito and I always get their chipotle sauce to go with it. I&apos;ve have a lot of things off the menu and they&apos;ve all been tasty so you really can&apos;t go wrong. Give them a try - you won&apos;t regret it!,"I&apos;ve been to this place a few times now and tried a bunch of stuff because I was so excited to see a taco truck in the neighborhood.

Chile Relleno (2) - This seems to be their special for a while now. I&apos;ve always been a fan especially after my trip to PV. I was a little worried at first because it didn&apos;t come with meat and as a protein fanatic, I had some reservations. However, after trying it I can see why meat wasn&apos;t needed. The chile is beautifully battered and fried but leaves more of a fluffy taste than a crunchy one. There was a generous amount of cheese oozing out from inside and they give you two large stuffed chile peppers. It comes as a combo and you get corn tortillas in case you want to make your own tacos, definitely a great buy.

Sopes/Gordita (3) - This isn&apos;t like the traditional sopes I&apos;ve had. The base is exactly what I excepted in a sope, thick on the outer ring yet still soft throughout. I can&apos;t really say if there was a layer of mashed beans cause I didn&apos;t see it but I did taste it very faintly. Then you have your choice of meat on top which I had a generous amount of carne asada once again. They top it off with cheese, caramelized onions and cilantro, but instead of lettuce and salsa, they give you two slices of avocado. Eating it as is the sope was a little dry for me. After adding martajada rojo sauce it really worked out. I personally prefer salsa but that&apos;s my preference.

Tacos - My first visit I wanted to get a quick taste test to see if this truck was legit so I order a bunch of tacos. It was your standard street taco but with added salsa. Shrimp, this was definitely my favorite. Again it came in a generous portions (surprising cause most places aren&apos;t like that with seafood). Fish, I loved the flavor and how the fish stayed moist. Carnitas, it was a bit oily for me, but the meat was super tender. Chicken, I&apos;m not a fan of chicken taco in general but the meat had the same consistency of a carnitas taco. Chorizo, you can&apos;t go wrong with chorizo, it tasted exactly as you would expect,m. Lengua, I don&apos;t like lengua and this wasn&apos;t part of my order but I received it anyways. Still not a fan of that texture.

While they don&apos;t have an actual red sauce, they do often five different types of sauce. I&apos;ve tried four of them: 
1. Salsa Verse - doesn&apos;t taste like much. 
2. Martajada Verde - tastes like an actual Salsa Verde from other Mexican restaurants.
3. Martajada Rojo - closes thing to a hot chili sauce
4. Habanero - a few drips is enough spice

I prefer Martajada Rojo just cause I can pour a lot on my food to get that additional flavor and kick.

Overall, a great taco truck, really convenient location away from traffic and ample parking.",We love El Camion.  But.....this location needs to amp up their service.  Nice folks but they need to bust a move!! Took 45 mins to get our food.  Not good!,"Somehow, back in the summer of 2018, when I was restaurant hopping (trying out many new restaurants), I never stumbled upon this one, yet it is so well known. Apparently, this place is a go-to for my coworkers back when offices were open. 

Now that I&apos;m finally back in Seattle, I decided to give this a try - takeout style, quick and delicious! I got the house specialty - the Tacos Chukis, overloaded with delicious toppings including a pineapple. While pineapple on pizza is a heated topic, pineapple on tacos is unanimously a flavor enhancement. The value is great as you can get one taco for $2.75 + tax. 

Every bite into the taco is a flavor bomb. Everything is there to be honest - I don&apos;t need to add additional toppings to enhance the tacos. Do note that it can be quite messy to eat, so get a fork and sanitize thoroughly.","I am unsure if I could physically exist on this planet if Tacos Chukis ever closed. Their baby burritos are what dreams are made of. I am vegetarian and the baby bean burrito is literally a beacon of light in this dark world. I recommend ordering at least 3 of them. 

I have also been present in the restaurant when a customer absolutely ripped them a new one over a minor inconvenience with her tacos (during covid) she opened up her to-go food right there at the register (like hello, you should leave) and complained about how there was no meat on her cactus tacos. Then had the nerve to YELL in an old ladie&apos;s face about it. The Chukis team handled it with absolute class and humility.

Did I mention they have extremely fair prices? This establishment and their food is the real MVP.

I hope someone is feeding me a baby burrito on my death bed. 

Thanks Chukis","One of my favorite places to visit in my neighborhood for quick bite to eat! 
The house &apos;Taco Chukis&apos; is where it&apos;s at! Adobada pork, grilled pineapple, melted cheese, onion, cilantro, salsa and guacamole on a soft corn tortilla! Wash it down with a refreshing Pacifico! There is indoor/outdoor seating, but with the current restrictions due to covid, there is no longer indoor seating, but there is an outdoor bar/ledge that you can belly up to and enjoy your food! Cheers!","I love this location. As usual food is delish and affordable. Quick ordering. 

Compared to the Cap Hill/Broadway location, this one is way nicer but both locations have good quality and tasty foods :p yum!","Great location 
Nice staff working here 
The taco is really cheap
And quite fulfilling
I love it soooo much","I might be biased because I lived off of tacos in Texas, but these tacos were not so great. I had high expectations coming in because I&apos;ve been told it was one of the best places for tacos in Seattle, but I found myself to be quite disappointed.
The meat was a little bit dry and the tortilla (which I consider as the KEY piece) wasn&apos;t soft, but the tangy and spicy sauce helped compensating.
However, the cashier was very nice and welcoming, and the food came out quickly.
Overall, if you want to grab a quick bite and get decent food, this isn&apos;t a bad place for that!","YES! All for this taco spot! I&apos;ve always heard great things and read the raving reviews about this place so I don&apos;t know what took me forever and a day to finally try it. I recently moved into the area not too far from Taco Chuki&apos;s. I was super hungry one evening and so my friend and I decided to try it out. 

I got 3 tacos and it was quite filling for me. The house taco was by far the best one that I tried. The grilled pineapple makes it extra yummy! Each bite is filled with so many flavors. I also had the adobada and the asada. Both were yummy but the asada seemed a tad dry for my liking. My friend got 3 tacos along with the baby burrito and he said it was packed with meat. I cannot wait to keep coming back!!","Beef 8/10 $2.35 each

Finally visited the famous Tacos Chukis! Heard so many good things from the locals about the tacos here. Loved the sauces on top but i definitely still think pineapples are the best topping on these type of tacos. The beef itself was slightly dry when I tried them but that could be from the drive home. Will be back for more!!!","I wonder if people keep coming here due to hype?

Maybe I keep comparing it to my fav taco location in Utah, El Morelense, and Los Tacos No 1 in NYC. The first time I had Tacos Chukis was a few years ago in Cap Hill. Neither my boyfriend nor I were big fans of the place and we didn&apos;t get it why everyone raved about it. 

Fast forward to today. People are still raving about Tacos Chukis and since I didn&apos;t get my usual dose of tacos over the holiday season in Utah, I have some massive cravings. This location opened up a year or so ago and so we decided to give Tacos Chukis a second try. 

Honestly, I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll be going back so I deemed it the Yelp 2 star &quot;Could&apos;ve been better&quot;. It wasn&apos;t bad, but I wouldn&apos;t recommend it. It tastes pretty basic.","I was searching for a taco truck around the area but then ran into this place on yelp. I went to the south lake union location and was able to park right next to the restaurant for pick up. 

I love how efficient this restaurant is! You order online and they will send you a message how long your food will take, about 10 min for me. When your food is done they text you again. When I entered inside, the staff was super friendly! Loved the whole transaction.

I ordered taco Chukis (they&apos;re specialty) and carne asada tacos and an abodabo taco.
I&apos;m gonna be honest, the asada ones were dry and not flavorful. I&apos;ve def had better. 
The speciality ones were good esp with the cheese, but again it was missing some flavor. 
Don&apos;t get me wrong, I still ate all my tacos but I don&apos;t think I would get them again. Instead, I&apos;ll be back to try their torta!","Love the tacos here. This reminded me of los tacos no 1 in NYC.
Rating
Food - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Price - 5/5","I LOVE this place, they have great quality food, efficient service, and I think they are fairly priced! Income frequently and will continue to do so.","A solid spot for Mexican fare -- I went to the location in SLU and the food was pretty good and there are vegetarian options! 

Two tacos and a baby burrito are super filling and I got the frijoles and nopal tacos and frijoles baby burrito. The food was all really good, although next time I&apos;d probably add cheese to my baby burrito. The veggie tacos were good and the nopal was unique since it was a cactus leaf which I&apos;ve never had before. Overall solid spot which has vegetarian food as well!","This place is such a classic. The CapHill location has been my go-to for years but I decided it was time to try out the location in SLU. Man, this place just never disappoints. 

If you want authentic, flavorful tacos for a great price THIS. THIS IS IT. I honestly found both locations very comparable however this SLU location has a more modern/newer kinda vibe, whereas the CapHill location is smaller/older(which I personally feel makes it more ~authentic~

My go to is usually 1 quesadilla with either carne asada or pollo asado along with 1-2 house tacos depending on how hungry I am. I have a pretty average appetite and that order keeps me stuffed.

I&apos;ve brought friends here who have grown up eating tacos their entire life and even they say that Tacos Chukis is by far one of the closest to authentic. 

If you&apos;re coming here for your first time you NEED to try the house tacos to get a full experience and I would highly recommend a quesadilla to elevate your experience.","This is my second time at a Tacos Chukis location, and it&apos;s even better than I remembered. I ordered lunch for pickup at the South Lake Union location, and the process was super easy. This location also has a sleek modern look (different from the Capitol Hill one).

We tried all three types of meat tacos (adobada, asada, and pollo), and all were delicious. The juicy pineapple slice on the taco adobada definitely puts it ahead of the rest, though. I also ordered one mulita and think the cheese is worth the extra money--will mix it up more the next time I visit! Menu options are limited but all of them are perfectly executed. My partner loved it so much that he actually returned a few days later to get lunch again.

The food was also packaged well, with sturdy paper plates, foil coverings, and a paper bag. All tacos survived the trip in the car safely!","Our go-to for some fresh, tasty and cheap tacos and burritos. I have tried every taco on the menu (including the nopales) and never once been disappointed with Tacos Chukis - they are consistent. I recommend adding the grilled pineapple on everything!","Yes, yes and yes! Don&apos;t even think about it - just order these tacos already. The Carne asada ones are my favorite!!! There&apos;s so much flavor &amp; the seasoning is just perfect. The chicken was pretty good but I def prefer the Carne asada ones more!","Friendly staff, spacious lobby that is safe for ordering and take out. Loved the collection of small burritos: carne asada pork and chicken. Order four if you&apos;re really hungry!","Since I am still looking for the best Mexican place that serves good Burrito/Tacos/Quesadilla, I finally give this place a try. Hmmm. Did not capture my heart, but this is worth the try! 

4 star for the price,
$2.15 for mullitas- fairly priced!
and $2.85 for quesadilla (I found a bit overpriced)
-No free salsa (which I found odd)
But I can give 5 star for the price of baby Burrito which is $4.00, it is filled with steak! Which I find very generous!


5 star for the location, easy to navigate and street parking is ample.

5 star for the customer service. Food is served fast and warm. Everyone is friendly and attentive.

4 star for the taste, they might not have the &quot;mexican style burrito&quot; but the generous amount of protein is enough to give them 4 stars. Be aware that they are serving Americanized Burrito, which means no beans, no rice, just plain bread steak and herbs. 

This might be your Taco/Burrito place to go to if you are craving for Western style Burrito.

Tip: You have to pay for the Salsa, I get it that this is not a typical Burrito place, but it&apos;s like going to Mcdonald&apos;s and paying for the Ketchup.","This spot in Downtown Seattle is seriously one of my favorite affordable eats.  I can get a great meal easily under $10, which is a steal these days.  My best friend and his wife and I were craving taco&apos;s and burrito&apos;s.  Tacos Chukis was on our list so we ventured over and was greeted promptly by the amazing staff.  

We ordered various tacos, beer, and horchata.  The food came out promptly and the portion size of the tacos was very generous.  The horchata paired well with the food and I was simply satisfied once I scarfed the tacos.  Both the carne asade and chicken were well seasoned and the sauces provided only added an extra boost of flavor.

The next time I come visit Seattle, I will definitely make sure to make a pit stop for my next taco fix.  It just reminds me of what &quot;Old Seattle&quot; used to be like back in the day.............","Nice patio for Covid distancing.  Communist theme, it&apos;s Fremont, ya know Lenin statue, if you&apos;re too closed minded to get over it go somewhere else.  Otherwise, you are in for quite a treat, because good tacos are hard to come by in Seattle, but not here.  Haven&apos;t had a taco I didn&apos;t like yet, but Yucatan and Tequila Lime Chicken are as good as it gets.","Just ordered takeout and took it to discovery park! 
With 4 people got 12 tacos! 
Pork Adobo taco, 
tequila lime chicken taco, 
honey shrimp taco
Any taco from here is incredible! 
Highly recommended","This is one of my favorite spots on the planet!!!! The staff is fantastic and the food is always mind blowing!! I live in West Seattle and my wife and I still make the long trek to get there. It&apos;s totally worth it! They have a big selection of tacos (some classics, some unique) all of which are 100% delicious. They started doing burritos during COVID and they are pretty much the size of a newborn child. Don&apos;t forget to add cheese &amp; guac! It&apos;s at least two meals worth! Some of my absolute favorites are the chips, salsa &amp; guac, the Buffalo chicken burrito, tequila lime chicken taco, Yucat√°n slow roasted pork taco, bacon cheeseburger taco, carnitas taco and their AMAZING torta with an incredible dipping sauce!  Go now! Don&apos;t wait! You won&apos;t regret it!","I recently moved to Fremont and stumbled upon this place while walking. I tried their Sriracha honey tofu taco as it sounded delicious. However was disappointed by its underwhelming or lackluster falvour. It was totally bland. Underseasoned and dry. There were no salsas provided which otherwise would have somewhat helped with the flavor.
Wanted to love this place but was sadly disappointed :( might be non vegetarian options are better but it&apos;s a NO for vegan or vegetarian folks. However I do liked their home made tortillas. To sum up I paid 9$ to eat a home made tortilla","Red Star Taco Bar is a fun place.  I came here for Taco Tuesday, where select tacos are two dollars all day long.  However, they also do Margarita Mondays ($6 margs and trivia) and Movie Night Wednesdays (movies played on the TVs and projector).

I ordered three tacos: Tequila Lime Chicken, Breakfast, and Carnitas.  All three were great, but my favorite was the Breakfast one.  The tacos were medium sized and these are normally $3 or $4 dollars each.  I thought three tacos were a good portion for lunch.  I might try different tacos next time, just to mix it up.

I came here with four other people and it is a great place for groups.  We sat in one of their nice booths and it was super easy for us to split the check at the end.  I would definitely recommend this place.","Hey, I like tacos and nachos and margs.  And when I found out there was a bar, dedicated to tacos in Seattle, I was excited to check it out.  Located in Fremont, Red Star Taco Bar offers a variety of tacos with a full bar.  I can get down with that. 

We started with the nachos, which was a massive size, so is great for sharing.  They were your standard nachos, but you really can&apos;t go wrong with with this classic appetizer, especially when it has a dollop of guac.  For tacos, since there&apos;s quite a lot to choose from, you can either get three tacos, priced at $3.50 for $9 or three tacos, priced at $4.50 for $12.  I recommend getting the more expensive tacos, as they are more inventive. 

For my three tacos I ordered the Catfish, Carne Asada and the Buffalo Chicken.  They make their own corn tortillas here, which were fine.  They&apos;re not my favorite, as they were more thick than what I prefer, but they were still good.  Of all the tacos, I really liked the catfish one!  The batter on the catfish was made with crushed tortilla chips, which added some delicious crunch and the fish was a thick piece.  I also really liked the cajun crema sauce on it, adding some zest.  Get this if you like catfish!  The carne asada was good, especially with the lime crema.  Yet I&apos;ve had better.  But what I didn&apos;t like as much was the buffalo chicken, which was surprising since I love buffalo chicken anything.  Chicken tasted dry, unfortunately. 

Overall, this is a good taco bar in Seattle.  And we need more taco bars/eateries in the area!  Red Star is a chill place to check out, that&apos;s only 21+, with a full bar menu and marg specials.  Let&apos;s taco &apos;bout it.","We went to Red Star Taco Bar per Eater&apos;s recommendation on essential Fremont restaurants. I enjoyed the fact that their menu heading were &quot;pre-taco&quot;, &quot;taco&quot;, &quot;post taco&quot;, and &quot;taco-ish&quot;. Have to appreciate some taco humor. :)

Things I liked:
1) Plentiful margarita options- including slushies!
2) Numerous taco options (there is only 1 veggie option though)
3) Prices were reasonable (3 tacos for $11)
4) Special deals like Taco Tuesday ($2 tacos) and Margarita Mondays

I ordered the Baja Fish, Yucatan pork, and Carne Asada tacos. They were all solid choices. This is not your super traditional taco place but it is good. I really liked the Yucatan pork tacos (because in my humble opinion, there is no better taco than a pork taco). However, I am a lover of all tacos so I was content. 

My friends and I also split the Honey Sriracha wings- they were super delicious and packed with flavor. If you like spicy, you will enjoy these.
We also split the chips &amp; salsa &amp; guac. I really liked their salsa because it was spicier than most salsa you get at Mexican restaurants. It was more blended (not pico de gallo) but had a strong peppery taste. The chips came nice and warm and were delicious. 

Overall, I really liked this place. It was casual, laid back, and affordable. The food was good and the drinks were tasty. There is an outdoor area with seating if you want to enjoy the nice weather we are having now.","One of my favorite spots in Fremont for tacos and margs. The HH deals are fantastic for tacos and apps and the margs are always amazing. Made from scratch with minimal sugar added, things can get dangerous. 

The nachos are huge and super tasty, loaded up with all your favorite toppings and then some. Dads taco is a must if you&apos;re there for HH.","Got the chorizo, sriracha shrimp, and catfish tacos. The chorizo was very flavorful - I should have just got 3 of this. Catfish was also good but the shrimp one was kind of underwhelming. The monthly special (cheeseburger taco) sounded interesting but I didn&apos;t get to try it. Great spot overall with good deals during happy hour and for taco Tuesdays. Will be back to try something off their drinks menu.","Pretty solid spot. Their happy hour is even more solid AND $2 tacos on Tuesday&apos;s is the super steal. The  special fried chicken taco is tight, also the buffalo chicken, short ribs, catfish, and the pork one, alllll fire. 
Plus I&apos;m a sucker for ice cream or slushees and they have margarita slushes in like 10 flavors, the raspberry one was my favorite out of the 4 different ones. Uh let&apos;s see what else -- nope I think that&apos;s it.","On our most recent visit, we encountered the bartender that Darnit Y succinctly describes as the &quot;slowest, laziest most useless excuse for a service industry worker in all of Ballard&quot;. Couldn&apos;t have said it better myself. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/red-star-taco-bar-seattle?select=YREvliWdnWRQPtgj6BXu-g

This bartender had his buddies at the bar, and by God was he taking care of them. He would momentarily be distracted by the fact that customers had come in, but remembered that his main job was cavorting with friends. Not something so mundane as taking orders, bringing bills, or anything so distasteful.

Indeed - after taking our drink order, I got to wait about 20 minutes for him to prepare the complex concoction knowns as pouring a Pacifico from the tap. And as I opened my mouth to provide a food order, he ran off to be with his friends again.

I waited about 15 more minutes - and then made the grave infraction of interrupting the bartender&apos;s conversation to ask if we could place an order. He snapped at me angrily, how dare he sully his hands to do work. Work is for the proletariat, as he stormed off huffily. When he came back, I asked him to just bring the check for the one beer, since he was too busy talking to his friends.

Oh boy - his buddy the white knight was suddenly activated. He stood up and started yelling, really giving the rest of the restaurant a show. Swearing like a sailor as he rose to the lazy bartender&apos;s defense, until even the subject of his affection was blushing at this pathetic display.

After I grew bored of this show, we departed and went to Galo&apos;s up the street.

There&apos;s so much other Mexican inspired food nearby. TNT, Pecado Bueno, Pablo Y Pablo, and others. With Red Star raising its prices recently, I see little reason to return. Especially while the lazy bartender perches behind the counter.

EDIT: Thank you for your completely pointless response. The fact that you consider this service to be exceptional, despite additional complaints about the exact same bartender, is absolutely hilarious. Though the fact that you consider criticisms of your business to be a greater offense than poor customer service in your own words, is incredible, albeit unsurprising.

If we take your &quot;timestamps&quot; at face value and I was indeed there for less time, that does not negate the complaint. While I wasn&apos;t timing every checkpoint of our visit with a stopwatch, since I wasn&apos;t foreseeing getting into an argument with a recalcitrant owner, time did drag on as your bartender ignored us in favor of the party on our left.  Including while he was &quot;making drinks&quot;.  What drink is on your menu that takes 5 minutes to make?  Give me a break.

Don&apos;t worry, I won&apos;t be back. But if you want to survive in an increasingly competitive downtown Fremont with increasing number of restaurants, a slice of humble pie might be in order. Who knows, maybe you&apos;ll finally be able to afford a security camera with greater video quality than my grandmother&apos;s Magnavox VCR.","Sad to change my review about this place. I really liked coming here, but my most recent experience left me feeling pretty put off.

We sat down at the bar for dinner and the bartender seemed really preoccupied with his &quot;friends&quot; at the bar. After some time, he handed us one food menu for a two-person party - which I felt was super weird.

Then we waited some more and watched him leisurely make drinks for a busy night, and he takes forever to check on us. When he finally decides to come around and grace us with his presence, my hubby orders a beer, and we get 10-15 more minutes of waiting.

The bartender sure was busy talking to his buddies at the bar for the past 20 minutes. He finally brings the beer, and we&apos;re decided on food. But of course he is too busy in his own world, and completely ignores us.

My husband pointed out that we were trying to order, and the bartender got offended. We figured we&apos;d leave at that point, but then his friend started yelling at us, making a scene.  The bartender shouldn&apos;t have his friends at the bar, and he displayed a serious lack of professionalism. We won&apos;t be coming back. :(","Let me start off by saying that when I have physically gone into this location, it&apos;s extremely yummy. I love the Korean tacos. The service was &quot;eh&quot; but I will also note that both times I went was on a Friday and there were shows going on in the area.

The reason why I&apos;m only giving 2 starts is actually because of that delivery option you see above....
I was staying with a friend who lives about 1 mile from this place. It was on the list of places that delivered to his place. I was excited and ordered some tacos and a quesadilla. After over an hour of waiting, I get a call from Grubhub (their delivery partner) and was told the restaurant was cancelling my order due to &quot;having never received it&quot;. (Which didn&apos;t make any sense). This was on a Thursday. Then this week, on Tuesday, I tried to re-order this same thing. I watched it go through on the app and waited about 30 minutes and got another call from GrubHub. The restaurant was cancelling my order again but didn&apos;t give a reason. I was pretty livid and called to the restaurant.  They said they &quot;didn&apos;t do delivery&quot; and that I must be ordering from the wrong place.  

‚Äç‚Äç","Stopped in for a quick lunch it was pretty ok. 

Queso - delicious and a very large portion
Sriracha honey shrimp taco - really delicious 
Short rib taco - pretty good
Carnitas - too much cinnamon 

The tortillas were too big for the contents therein. I&apos;d go back to have margaritas for sure. The space is cool.","Hubby finally convinced me to try it out. We went for happy hour and wasn&apos;t disappointed. The tofu tacos were delicious. Get the homemade corn tortillas. The HH nachos were humongous.
We will come for dinner soon.
Support local business","Their veggie tamale was excellent and pepper queso dip was to die for. These two totally overshadowed their veggie tacos, which were just okay. I&apos;d definitely go back though, not for the tacos but for their other offerings.","I asked for a box for my food, stepped outside remembered I left it behind(turned around immediately) and it was thrown out. No apology, no promise to make up for it. Nothing, just &quot;sorry we threw it out&quot; 



our bill was $110 for 5 weak drinks and some nachos that would have tasted better from taco bell(cause at least they wouldn&apos;t have been sold out of steak and queso on a monday)

Update: I&apos;m glad I left.the nachos, i had the worst cramping/diarrhea from then it was almost unbearable l. Next time I order Mexican food it won&apos;t be there. I must admit the food was very tasty, just not worth the cramps, cost and my to go box being thrown away.

My wife and I have been here 2 other times, the food was tasty and we did not have the same problem.",Great taco bar in Fremont! The place is 21 and over which is pretty cool and gave more of a bar vibe which was great. The tacos were amazing and i definitely want to go back to try more of there menu. Great date spot as well and did not have to wait for a table at all,"Red Star redemption yay!! We went back after months of being taco-deprived. Although with our favorite tacos, we ordered a Korean short rib quesadilla and it was amazinggggg! Best quesadilla I&apos;ve ever had and I&apos;m really glad that it comes with two pieces instead of three, because we definitely would have fought over it. 

Service is still friendly and even when it isn&apos;t speedy it&apos;s understandable because a) they are almost always crowded and b) the food is so worth it. Price is fantastic for the quality and serving sizes. 

My boyfriend and I now order our own quesadillas, and I tell him he can&apos;t go get them without me :)","Tacos were just OK. Beverage selection was minimal but decent. Monday nights offer deals on margaritas and taco Tuesdays offer $2 tacos. Service was good but it&apos;s super claustrophobic and dark in here - not much space to move around and surfaces are a little sticky - what you&apos;d expect in a bar I suppose. Came here for trivia night and between everyone needing to turn in their slips of paper each round, regulars lounging about the bar, and servers racing around, it was a veritable game of Pac-Man trying not to run into someone!

Our server was friendly and kept my water glass full through the two games of trivia but I had to find my own silverware as I couldn&apos;t track her down when the food arrived. I was sad they were out of the vegetarian tamales when I was there but I will have to come back to try them!","Great local place, affordable, filling, delicious, and takes care for COVID distancing.","What we&apos;ve tasted:
Nachos must order! Sooo good
Green Enchilada  phenomenal
Tinga tostada, not bad, but had a mild sweetness that I&apos;m not used to in Mexican food
Their homemade corn tortillas are delicious. This is a great little restaurant and a perfect stop for dinner when you are walking around the lake. Highly recommend","We love this place! Delicious tacos and quesadillas with the best salsa to top it off! We haven&apos;t been able to dine in yet, but take out is very quick and easy and the staff is very friendly. The closest to legit Mexican i have seen in Seattle! Just wish the PNW appreciated Tex Mex Queso","I do not know where my review went!! I have been here 3 times- each was a delight.
It is  a little plain inside and quite crowded each time I went.
We were in a group which did nto bother the server ne bit. The food was delicious.
Thanks yelp, for popping this restaurant tup on my feed so I can repost a review.","Seattle has no shortage of Mexican restaurants. It used to be hard to go wrong, but these days it&apos;s a challenge to find a place that is true to their region or culture.

The first thing I saw when reviewing their page was a comment from a poster that said ,&quot;best Mexican north of Capitol Hill&quot;. That made me a bit nervous, but we made the trip anyway. When we got there, there was one group eating outside. We decided to eat inside and were the only guest other than the steady flow of people getting take out.

What bothered me first was service, despite being the only inside guest, it felt like the outside table got far more attention. I had to ask multiple time for water and salsa as it appeared the salsa bar was not available to customers. Having a full glass of ice water is a must for me and not only was my glass mostly empty, there was no ice. Clearly they had ice, because the people outside had ice, but again, we were marginalized.

The food came in reasonable time and it was as good as the reviews claim, however, I found an issue that left a bad taste in my mouth. I had the rolled tacos and the menu clearly states topped with guacamole. I saw no guacamole and when I asked our server, he said there is a guacamole sauce, and pointed to a faint green drizzle that really required a microscope. My first reaction was to point out the menu said guacamole, not guacamole sauce. But I had hoped he would do the right thing and just offer a small side for the confusion. That didn&apos;t happen. May be trivial to some, but for me, it&apos;s the same as not having a tomato top my burger and have someone say, oh we use ketchup for that.

Combine that with the slow sloppy service and I can&apos;t give these guys the average rating. The food was good, I&apos;ll say it again, but combine with services and misleading menu, I can&apos;t recommend this place.","I really like this spot. Their food is delicious and they&apos;re always very nice. Pro tip though, if you&apos;re ordering fajitas to-go, make sure you ask for the fixings and extra tortillas. Two is not enough! I also asked for salsa but didn&apos;t get any with my order. So check your bag before you leave.","Even though id assume that this spot would be really americanized due to its location,  I was clearly mistaken. I will comment that the pricing is not worth it unless you go for happy hour. Outside of that, the ingredients are super fresh and the quality was pretty top notch, all paired with amazing warm service. 

I swung by for their late night happy hour (9 to close] and I tried a variety of the offerings. 

Tacos 5/5 - $2.50 each and the steak tacos were my favorite.

Quesadilla Frita 3/5 - wasnt all that great and I wouldn&apos;t order it again.

Caldo de Olla 4/5 - this sour tomato-y beef stew was good and interesting! Its neat how they had fresh cactus in the soup. I&apos;d recommend trying it!

Overall this would be a fantastic spot for hh deals, but given the service and location, I wouldn&apos;t be butthurt coming in during regular hours. I&apos;d recommend checking this spot out!",Do yourself a favor and try this place.  It&apos;s a tiny little space in Greenlake with phenomenal Oaxacan authentic food.  This is not your standard American/Mexican place that we have so many of around here.  The place is seemingly run by a family who will welcome you in as if you were their honored guest or even family.  I have never had a better wet chicken burrito and both the green and red sauce are terrific.  Plus the burrito is huge.  If you can finish it I have to tip my cap to you.  And my favorite thing of all time at an authentic Mexican restaurant? Salsa bar.  They make 3 different home made salsas and you can have at it at their fresh salsa bar.  My plan is to have lunch here at least once a week.,"Yo!

This place is legit good. 

I&apos;mma drop a bookmark here to return. Ambiance
doesn&apos;t feel great to hang out for a long dinner but the food is on point. 
 
Pescado tacos and enchiladas verdes. A+ Reminded of some of the enchiladas I&apos;d had in Mexico City - and I&apos;ve been doing enchiladas since I was 3.","Cocina Oaxaca has quickly become our favorite Mexican restaurant north of Capitol Hill. 

Love the food, all of it. Delicious mole, salsas, rice and beans, margaritas, all their staples are excellent. Tacos al pastor are great. Good carne asada. Great pozole, and I don&apos;t usually favor pozole. 

Staff is very friendly. Prices are reasonable. They&apos;re kid- friendly. Decorations are fun to look at. Cozy, fun ambiance. 

There is 2 hour parking for the restaurant below the building, which is a big plus.","I&apos;m so behind in my Yelp posts, but this evening&apos;s solo happy hour experience/first time visit (8/14/18) was so on point. I felt compelled to let you know about Cocina Oaxaca at Green Lake. 

I parked a block or so away by Green Lake to take advantage of free, no zoned street parking. There&apos;s also underground parking, but felt like a brief walk to and from.
 
No reservations needed, was acknowledged immediately at the host stand, and promptly seated at a window side two top. Clearly it&apos;s both Happy Hour and family friendly. No need to people watch, especially once the food commands your full attention.

Aside from the main dining area, there&apos;s the open kitchen and bar area with giant flat screen (with Oaxacan futbol, of course). I&apos;m hoping third time will be the charm for this new business at this primo spot. I miss the former Italian place, but not that lackluster Japanese one. 

To get your bearings, this section of Green Lake businesses include Duke&apos;s, Zeek&apos;s, Ben and Jerry&apos;s, Jak&apos;s, and Chocolati. It&apos;s also directly across from the park&apos;s kiddie wading pool area.

Happy hour runs from 3-6pm and 9pm to close.
I posted both the happy hour and regular menus on Yelp...pretty vast selections from apps, soups, salads, HH bites/snacks, tacos, tortas, entrees, and with a full bar with a variety of tequila from my vantage point.

I thought of my pastry school classmate and her brother who hail from Oaxaca, but coincidentally I visited on a Taco Tuesday as another Yelper pointed out.

I wished there was a combo taco plate, but proceeded to have an entree and two HH specials to check out some of my favorite go tos. No chorizo or lengua though.

I ordered the Tacos de Camaron ($12.99), trio of perfectly cooked plump shrimp with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, and their house dressing. Ate two of those, delicious!

I supplemented this with Carne Asada Tacos ($5 HH, $7.99), a pair with tender flavorful steak and cilantro, minced onion, and salsa. Ate one of those too, yum!

Another addition, the Tacos Al Pastor ($5 HH, $7.99), a pair with succulent pork marinated in chile and pineapple, also topped with cilantro, minced onion, and salsa. Yes, one of these also savored.

I skipped the rice and beans ($3 extra) to save room. The tortillas are handmade and thin, which means more protein and vegies than carbs. However, another tortilla would have provided more structure and integrity, especially if getting them as takeout. The fork and napkin become necessities, however, just aim for your mouth. You don&apos;t want to miss any of these flavorful tacos! Nice compositions visually and definitely palate pleasers.

Excellent service from Miguel from start to finish. Tasty tacos! That&apos;s enough reason for me to return and further explore their menu, maybe get a cocktail too. Looking forward to future visits for sure! Terrific addition to the Green Lake neighborhood!",Andres is a good bar tender. This place is pretty authentic Oaxaca style. We had the puerco en salsa and mole negro with chicken and we were not disappointed. Def recommend! And Andres is the bomb!!,"Ok... I got to say, bravo to the service and the quality of food. The enchiladas are great in texture where it&apos;s not smothered with sauce.
The sauce that came with it, was also tasty but not overpowering.",My wife and I buy seven meals a week and delivery them to our children&apos;s homes. When we called in our order we ask that the meals be labeled so that we can deliver the right meal to each recipient without having to open all the meal containers. When I picked up my order l again asked if the meals had been labeled and was told they had been. When we got to our fist stop we discovered they had not been labeled so we had to open each meal box to figure out what was in each box. In doing this I notice how small each portion was. My children reported the food was okay but nothing special.,"Please Yelp add 1/2 stars. Rounded up to 4 when I really would give 3.5 if possible but they&apos;re definitely better than a 3. 

Saw that this place opened a little while ago and had been planning on trying it. Didn&apos;t really plan on trying it last night but Jaks Alehouse was packed. This place was busy too but we only had to wait about 5 min at the bar with our house margaritas. Which were delicious but not very strong. 

To start we ordered a basket of chips and salsa. You do have to pay $3 for them but then you can help yourself to the salsa bar. There&apos;s a verde, orange, red and pico de gallo. The verde was our least favorite. The smoky red was our favorite. 

Hubby ordered the fish tacos. He wasn&apos;t crazy that the fish was cut into pieces instead of one big piece of fish. He also felt it would be better with 2 tortillas to hold together better. 

I ordered one of my &quot;go tos&quot; at a Mexican restaurant. The chicken enchiladas with verde sauce. A little disappointed that only black beans are offered. I prefer whole pintos or refried beans. Their rice is excellent. I might get all rice and no beans next time. The enchiladas themselves were good. A bit skinnier than I&apos;m used to for an enchilada but the serving or 3 instead of 2 makes up for it. Also personal preference I&apos;d like more cheese on top. 

Will go back again &amp; sample some other options.","Stopped here while my friend and I were on a walk through Greenlake, and we got really hungry really fast. Decided to take a chance on this place! It was full of people and had a good vibe going. Big mistake. It took about 10 minutes to be seated, and they didn&apos;t even ask if we would like to be seated indoors or outdoors, so we had to ask to move. Service:
some of the worst service I have experienced, they never checked on our waters and forgot we were there once we were done with our food, so sat for about 30 extra minutes waiting for someone to offer a check or a box, but they never did so finally we went inside to pay for this tragic meal. 
Food: 
Their menu looks amazing, it has a wide variety of foods, and I&apos;m not a huge fan of the prices but I was expecting that range in Greenlake. When we ordered, I was confident we got some of the best food, my friend the quesadilla Fritas (she is vegetarian and was not feeling their veggie option), and me, the beef enchiladas in tomatillo sauce. Tasteless. They offer a salsa bar here, and I&apos;ll be honest we loaded up on it just to make our food taste like something even in the &apos;Mexican&apos; food category. We are both not huge fans of super spicy foods, but my rice and beans were plain. Let me repeat: white rice with obvious canned black beans that had not been spiced. Now, for the actual entree and focus of the dish. Representation was cute, but again my enchiladas tasted like I had just taken them out of the freezer and cooked them in the oven. The tomatillo sauce was tasteless, the beef dry and unseasoned, and that&apos;s all there was to my enchilada. Extremely boring meal and will not be returning as service and food is horrible for what you&apos;re paying.","Delicious! So glad there&apos;s now a reliable option for tacos in Greenlake. My friend and I both ordered tacos--I had the al pastor and she had the carne asada. The al pastor was SO flavorful, I really loved the marinade! The tacos are generously portioned, although I must say that they definitely need that second tortilla to hold up the weight of everything. By the time we both got half way through the second taco, the tortilla was all but falling apart. Despite that, I&apos;ll definitely be back!

They do charge for chips and salsa although they are made to order. We didn&apos;t order them since we weren&apos;t too hungry, but I&apos;ll have to give them a shot when I return.","Who doesn&apos;t like it when a new tasty restaurant shows up in your hood. My husband and I were super excited to give this new place a shot. 

The service is very nice. Sitting closer to the bar was better for comfort, sitting around the Corner near the bathroom smelled of bleach and cleaner (better than the alternative I guess...but chemicals with my food are not my bag baby) 

THE DRINKS: My husband LOVES their margaritas. So very good. I tried a Rosita and it was not my thing. If you want to feel like you are drinking an evergreen tree with some bitters, this could be your deal. Not mine. 

The salsa bar is nice, but the dishes are so small that they are hard to fit chips into.  

THE FOOD: The Carne Asada is amazing. We both loved that very much. I got the Tamale with pork and green sauce... there wasn&apos;t much pork of flavor. I love my Tamales was was so sad about this. 

So, we will likely be back to try again... but I felt pretty meh about it.","I was really impressed with the food here. I&apos;ve had Oaxacan food at a few other places, including in Oaxaca, Mexico. I love the rich, bright, complex flavors of the sauces from this region. Cocina Oaxaca did not disappoint. I ate here with my parents, we tried the quesadilla fritas, pollo en mole oaxaqueno, salad isabella and pollo en tomatillo. The quesadillas came drizzled with a delicious black bean sauce with a hint of anise; they were crispy on the outside with delicious, stringy cheese within. 

The mole was phenomenal, and the pollo en tomatillo was a real show-stealer. I tried the tamarind agua fresca - homemade, refreshing, perfect balance between tangy and sweet. I am looking forward to my next visit here.","Worth a stop, if you have time to spare. The quality of food is above average but not every menu item is a winner. For example, the shrimp tacos are excellently cooked and have fantastic depth of flavor, while the Al Pastor tacos are dry, mild, and lacking their keystone flavors. To give fair warning, the tacos are very thin for the shrimp, so it&apos;s likely they&apos;ll start falling apart if you let them soak in the juices for too long. 

My main reason for giving a 4 over a 5 is because this location is experiencing growing pains as they encounter the amount of traffic coming in an out of the area. Our service was very slow and lacked the regular amount of attention you find at most sit-down restaurants. Realistically, I&apos;d give this place a 4.5. It&apos;s worth a visit, but won&apos;t be one of my regular go-to spots in the future.","I was in the U-Village area and wanted to grab quick bite to eat. When I walked in, I came to find out that the restaurant was being ran under new management. With all restaurants being only open for take out, the employees were very welcoming and nice as if I were dining in. The food wait wasn&apos;t long at all, I ordered the Enchiladas Rojas &amp; the Adobo Chicken Pasta. As far as the food, it was very delicious and very filling. The price i paid was very good, considering the great quality of the food. La Villa Mexican Restaurant is a restaurant that I highly recommend to all people who are looking to eat some good Mexican food in the area.","I ordered take-out tonight and it was terrific!  Mole, enchiladas and a fajita, along with extra guac.  The food was delicious and the servings so generous.  Extra chips and salsa.  A great value for awesome food.","High praise for La Villa Mexican Restaurant! Each entree ordered has been excellent; I would particularly recommend their chicken enchiladas suizas and a la crema. Sometimes an eatery just hits the spot, you know? This seems to be one of those places with a menu full of delicious eats.","Great value for your buck! The food here is amazing and super tasty! 

My friend got the steak (which was equally good as my dish) and I got the arrov con pollo (chicken) tomato dish with rice, beans, and cheese and salad. It was Soo tasty. I would order this Everytime. 

Definitely coming back here again.","I wanted this to be my next easy access Mexican restaurant being so close to where I live. Unfortunately the food was maybe the worst Mexican food I&apos;ve ever had and I didn&apos;t feel welcomed here at all by the server. I loved the space and all of their decorations, but they are missing some key elements to make a successful business IMO. 

My friend arrived first and got us a table. It seemed like there were plenty of tables available when I got there and yet there were still people waiting to be seated. I don&apos;t think they have many people working there so turnaround of tables was an issue. My friend ordered the beef enchiladas while I ordered the crab quesadilla. 

Red flag #1 should have been how long it took for the food to come out. Mexican food is usually super fast, unless you have a big party and they are trying to get all the dishes out at the same time. Red flag #2 was that they used surimi (imitation crab/crab stick) instead of actual crab AND charged me an extra $3 for it on the check! Um, what?! That stuff costs less than pork at the store - you definitely can&apos;t be upcharging for fake crab meat!!!

My water glass sat empty for the second half of the meal and it felt like the server was pissed off at us every time we flagged him down for something. This is why I left thirsty without asking for more water and didn&apos;t bother to dispute the extra $3 charge for terrible surimi in my utterly disgusting quesadilla. If you&apos;re going to try to sneak in fake crab, at least use enough cheese so that it melts the whole thing together and I can&apos;t tell the difference! This flour tortilla fold was dry and barely edible. I make a better quesadilla at home!",This place is really good! Authentic mexican food and great service. I&apos;ll be back again and again,"Great neighborhood Mexican place to grab dinner! Been there two times and have loved the food they have given us. Ask for chicken enchiladas with the chipotle or mole sauce (you can request mole sauce for the enchiladas but I can&apos;t seem to find that option in the menu so it was really nice of them to make a change because we love mole sauce) The only wish I had was for the portions to be a little larger, but regardless we love stopping by after an awesome haircut next door at the barbershop we love supporting the local business that are worthy of support!","Efficient takeout, very yummy entrees (creama enchiladas and taquitos), didn&apos;t care for the house salsa, but loved the beans and rice!","I have given this restaurant two tries. One a few weeks after they opened and again on Tuesday. I&apos;m going to base this review only on my second experience. I distinctly remember not being happy with the first, but I don&apos;t have the details fresh in my mind.

On Tuesday I was immediately stunned at how bad the tortilla chips tasted. They were bitter and the salsa tasted like it was laden with dry spices instead of fresh peppers, tomatoes, and onions. The chips were either burnt or cooked in burnt oil or both.

I ordered the &quot;La Villa&quot; burrito. I expected a fairly standard cheap Mexican place burrito with ground beef, rice and beans on the inside and lettuce, guacamole, cheese and sauce on the outside. What I got was a monster with everything stuffed inside and the top split open because it was overstuffed. The flavors were muddled to say the least and the quac was brown despite being hidden inside. When I finally found a pocket of the ground beef filling I thought it tasted pretty good, but the rest of the ingredients were under seasoned or had some weird spices in them that threw the flavors off.

My daughter had a quesadilla and some refried beans on the side. The beans were runny and devoid of flavor.

I don&apos;t recommend this place and will not be returning.",This is your traditional Mexican restaurant. Top notch. They use the best meat for their taquitos. This is one of the best Mexican restaurants I&apos;ve eaten at. And I&apos;m comparing them to Bay Area Mexican restaurants. You won&apos;t be disappointed!!!,"We came here on a Friday night because the wait for Mioposto was an hour. We had never noticed this little Mexican restaurant before and it looked kid-friendly/not packed. We had our toddler in tow who was hungry. We were immediately seated and we asked to order something immediately for our son. His food arrived lightning-fast! It actually arrived before my husband and I had ordered our food. This was perfect because we could feed him while we waited for our food. The staff was incredibly attentive and friendly. The food was homey and traditional. Definitely will add La Villa to our restaurant rotation. It&apos;s the perfect place to bring our toddler. He enjoyed the chicken burrito with rice and beans. We got the carne asada plate and enchiladas. I thought the carne asada was a little tough, but other than that everything was good. My husband also said his margarita was very good--I wouldn&apos;t know because I&apos;m very pregnant. All in all a great experience and we&apos;ll be back, La Villa!  Thank you for having such a friendly staff.","Great neighborhood Mexican restaurant! The food is fresh and service is excellent. We&apos;ve tried many items on the menu and all have been delicious. It&apos;s also nice to see local restaurants with that coveted &quot;Excellent&quot; rating for cleanliness from the department of health. They also have a great kids menu and are very accommodating to the young ones. 

If you live in the neighborhood, definitely add this to your &quot;night out&quot; rotation.","We love this place! So nice to have a good, consistent, not bank breaking restaurant in the neighborhood. We&apos;ve always had great service when we dine in and also love ordering take out from here too because it&apos;s typically ready in 10-15 minutes, max (like actually ready in a bag waiting for you). I love that they also include chips and salsa in take out orders without even asking. We hope this place is around for years to come!","Love this place!  Finally a great Mexican spot in this neighborhood.  Both food and drinks are awesome, and service is amazing. We have a baby and they always treat us so well. The baby loves the whole scene--service, setup, music, and food! It&apos;s our family go-to now because we know that we can have a delicious meal surrounded by awesome people who get it:) I highly recommend the Chile relleno and anything with their mole sauce.","This is a great neighborhood spot. Fast and friendly service, good drinks and good value. Both times I&apos;ve been I&apos;ve had mole chicken enchiladas. Super good. 

The building is old and has a slight smell, likely from water damage, which put me off the first time. My friends who were along didn&apos;t notice, so I wouldn&apos;t let it dissuade from a visit.","I was pleasantly surprised by La Villa. And in good ways. I was expecting the bland American-Mexican offering of enchiladas and fajitas, but found a very diverse menus and the food from it very good. 

Chiles En Noraga, Habanero Mahi-mhai and Tamale de Rajas were complex in flavor, fresh and well presented. Many other tasty items on the diverse menu to draw me back. Plus nice selection of small plates for less formal seatings. Chips are complimentary and come with a nice verde hot salsa. 

Cadillac Margaritas may be the best I have had in Seattle. And plenty strong. 

One downside of the setting is that a lot of the seating is dark and kinda stuffy. Try to get a spot by the windows. 

Service is good, especially for a newer restaurant. I walk past frequently and notice it seems to be getting busier. A good sign.","In all fairness I would give this place 3.5 stars... I rounded it up to four. I am so terribly picky when it comes to Mexican food and I feel like I only have a handful of places in the area that I would return to routinely. Lots of people say that Seattle doesn&apos;t really offer good Mexican food and for the most part that is true. If you come from the southern United States you can definitely confirm this without hesitation.
But out of all fairness La Villa wasn&apos;t horrible. It wasn&apos;t spiced the way I prefer but few places actually have the southwestern Mexican recipes in the area and do them well. The ingredients were indeed fresh and the food did have it&apos;s own charm to it which was a couple notches above than typical Mexican fare in town. The refried beans and rice were enjoyable. I got the beef chimichanga which was pretty good as well. Again though those spices that I love just aren&apos;t present in the Mexican restaurants up here though but since the food tasted fresh that went a long ways.
There was some confusion with the ordering process that I got frustrated about but it more or less got worked out.
The location of the restaurant is great and the service is very friendly and eager to please.","Word has it folks form the former Mr. Villa on Lake City (which was our previous go-to location for Mexican food) are operating this location.  So we were delighted (of course) to find out they moved closer to our home.  Solid Mexican food, nothing fancy, fairly conventional offerings (&apos;conventional&apos; in the best sense of the word), nothing unfamiliar.  Mexican comfort food might be the best way to describe their menu.

The dish I can&apos;t stop ordering is their feature dish &apos;La Villa&apos;.  Its their grilled skirt steak with bell peppers, onions &amp; mushrooms, finished with a fantastic avocado &amp; jalape√±o sauce. Its probably large enough to share, but I usually keep for myself, (leftovers the next day if necessary- &apos;cus I want it ALL!)

Servers are attentive and friendly. Decor is pleasant without getting too themey or gaudy.

After a long week and when the family doesn&apos;t feel like cooking- they know this is the place I will suggest!

Its great to have more dining options in NE Seattle. Look forward to going back.",I have been here twice when in area and am always amazed at the quality of the food. reminds me of Mexican in Arizona or Utah not the northwest.  Sopes are nicely made corn fritters with plenty of chicken and really hard to find in Seattle. Mole enchilada are excellent too.,"Probably the worst Mexican food I&apos;ve ever had. Literally the most basic thing, a taco salad and the meat was dry and the whole thing had no flavor. Honestly shocked by all the good reviews, clearly I ordered the wrong thing?? It also took like 7 minutes just to get a menu/waitress.","Had a few take out meals here, and it was fast and great everytime. The food is delicious, authentic, and reasonably priced. There is a road construction next to them, but the restaurant is open.","This place was a revelation.  This unassuming little cafe across from a fishing store and just a block from gasworks has delightfully tasty sandwiches and burritos. 

The $6.50 chorizo breakfast burrito stands out, every bite was perfect till the end. Delicious and comforting on a grey Seattle morning after a little too much wine the night before. 

A bit sloppy but otherwise *chefs kiss*","Usually I&apos;m driving past this Northlake location heading to/from the University District heading to either Fremont or lower Queen Anne. 

I just started a new job nearby a little over a month ago, so I&apos;ve been paying more attention to what&apos;s in the vicinity where Northlake meets up with Wallingford and Fremont. Mas Cafe is located along N 34th near Gasworks Park. Welcoming counter person, efficient kitchen crew, decent menu for such a pocket indie cafe. 

We walked over to Mas Cafe where the manager treated me and three other colleagues to lunch (2/10/21). They ordered burritos or tacos, I opted for the carne asada quesadillas ($8). The order came with onion/jalapeno/cilantro garnish, green salsa, and crema. Mammoth sized, chockful of meaty cheesy goodness, I was done in by a 1/4 portion. 

It was nice to sit outside to soak up sun rays despite the brisk breeze (=the calm before the snow event two days later). It was served on a foil wrapped paper plate, so I was able to transport it back to work and later home without any incident. The reheated leftover remained tasty. 

A pleasant find for breakfast, lunch, or coffee beverages featuring Mukilteo Coffee Roasters.","That endless search for Seattle&apos;s best breakfast burrito ended at Mas Cafe. The flavor, the quantity and the price all rest in harmony. In fact, I&apos;ve known about this place for months but withheld telling anyone other than close friends and family so as not to disrupt the delicate balance of culinary excellence and prompt service. In the past few years, I&apos;ve spent a significant time in Mexico and with each bite of their magnificent burritos, you can almost feel the warmth and sunshine as if you were taking a stroll through the local malecon. If you ever get the chance to visit the Pyramid of the Sun in Mexico city, climb to the very top, breathe deep, and you might experience some of the passion that Mas Cafe brings to their small Seattle outpost.","One of the best breakfast sandwiches around! (And for great value in quality/toppings). Have been back multiple times. 
Friend got the al pastor street tacos and claims they beat her previous local favorites. So happy to have found this gem!",Perfectly sized tasty breakfast burritos in a few different flavors at an excellent price! One reviewer said their burrito fell apart but my partner and I get burritos here at least once a week now and they&apos;ve never fallen apart. They offer coffees and juices. Our new go to. Easy to access parking options. Order directly from them inside the shop or by phone--don&apos;t order online through an ordering service who increases the prices. The burritos are only ~ $5/6.50 but ordering through here they&apos;re ~ $8/9.50,"This place was pretty good, but wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to get food from here again. The shrimp fajita wrap was mostly lettuce, hardly any shrimp and it was wrapped up poorly. My husband really loved his chicken sandwich. I had a bite and it was quite good. Tried all the tacos and they were good. Nothing particularly special. If you&apos;re in the area and need a quick bite, go for it.","I&apos;m giving them Stars for amazing customer service and decent coffee. I ordered a breakfast burrito which was huge, that&apos;s usually a good thing unless the burrito completely falls apart upon first bite. You should use foil or something to keep it together. The eggs in the burrito were burnt and tasted like wet dog, the salsa and veggies were fine but I only had like 3 pieces of potato. Took 3 bites and threw it out. Maybe try their breakfast sandwich but don&apos;t go for the burrito.","Family-run cafe. Serving tasty hot breakfast sandwiches, wraps and burritos. 
We ordered the Huli Huli Chicken sandwich and the Avocado breakfast sandwich. Crunchy bread, and soft succulent and juicy chicken. The avocado sandwich was generously filled and perfect for eggetarians.
Loved their coffee from local suppliers. 
You&apos;ve got to try their fresh carrot+orange+ginger juice.  
On a previous visit when they had just opened, we had tried their chicken burritos. Lip-smacking good.
1 street/block North of GasWorks main parking lot. They also have small parking area. I recommend just call ahead, park at GasWorks, grab your order and head over to the park to enjoy your meal.",The juice was GREAT and the street Tacos very DELICIOUS when I&apos;m in Seattle and want tacos This will be my go to !,I cannot believe I&apos;ve never been here before today.... I&apos;m kicking myself for however many weeks/months/years I&apos;ve been living within a mile of this place and NOT eating their food every day.  Got the bacon breakfast sandwich and one of the juice blends and wowwwewwwee holy wow this is beyond delicious. Already made a breakfast date to go back later this weekend. YUM!!!!!,Visited Mas Cafe for the first time today for coffee and breakfast sandwiches. Breakfast sandwiches were really tastey and reasonably priced! Looking forward to having this place in the neighborhood to frequent often!,"FINALLY! Mas Cafe has the best street tacos. They are the most authentic I&apos;ve had since leaving Mexico.  Small double tortillas, flavorful meat choices, amazing onions and hot sauce on the side. This is as close to taco perfection as you will find. 
Please check it out. You will not be disappointed.","The sandwiches are really good and flavorful. I recommend the Huli Huli and the egg sandwich. The brioche they use for the egg sandwich is so delicious. Tacos are delish. Great customer service, too.",Amazing food at a great value! I&apos;ve yet to find a menu item that I don&apos;t like. The flavors are amazing. A great addition to the neighborhood.,"Staff is very friendly here, I tried the tacos (one of each) and they were all superb; best street tacos in the area.",$6.50 for an excellent breakfast burrito in Seattle? Pretty much unheard of.  Also I&apos;ve been on the hunt for good Mexican food since moving here from Arizona and I&apos;m happy to finally have found a spot. Would definitely recommend and will be back.,"When in Seattle this is a must stop for authentic Mexican food at affordable prices  we pick up horchata and. ChirroI love the rolled tacos to the chimichanga plate, even the tacos are yum! 

They accept phone orders, you can come in and order, or even DoorDash. They accept cash &amp; card. 

Still my fave place","Okay so I&apos;ve eaten here twice now and both times I&apos;ve been pretty satisfied. It&apos;s not a perfect Mexican spot. It&apos;s not going to bring you back to your college days in San Diego. However, it&apos;s definitely gonna hit the spot even if it&apos;s a temporary fix. My favorite to date is the pork burrito. And they are always so nice to me. The horchata is fire as well. I don&apos;t know why people come here and expect so much. I&apos;m so thankful they&apos;re open so I am not complaining about dumb things here -- it&apos;s a huge meal at a great price at 4am if you need. I could try to think of 100 ways they might make me never come back but that&apos;s not the case here, I just love it. They are nice and the food is so good for what I need. Definitely give them a try. Plus... 24 hour? It&apos;s a no brainer. My advice? Don&apos;t walk into any Seattle Mexican joint with high expectations. But this place kills it.","I discovered this spot via DoorDash. Don&apos;t believe the b.s. bad reviews. This place has great tasting food. I&apos;m from the south where we know great Mexican. Trust me.

The meat has great flavor &amp; they know what they&apos;re doing.

I&apos;m looking forward to eating here in-person once the restaurants open back up.","Stopped in for a quick burrito, it was delicious and the service was great. Good bang for your buck!","Excellent four-star Mexican counter service food, but deducting a star for the music blasting SO CRAZY LOUD you literally can&apos;t do business at the counter. I&apos;m not a Boomer, it just really is that loud. 

The music is so loud that: 

The order-taker can&apos;t hear your order unless you repeat it 3-4 times, by name and item number, and maybe not even then. 

You can&apos;t hear their questions unless you lean in 10 inches away from them and they take their mask off. 

People picking up their orders can&apos;t hear when they&apos;re ready.  

And apparently the staff can&apos;t hear one another in the kitchen, since they got my order wrong (I ordered using the item number on the menu!  And used its name!  Several times!)

Music is nice but Memo&apos;s volume is totally excessive, especially now that there&apos;s no need to make the space too uncomfortable for lingering. Memo&apos;s should save some money on mistakes by lowering the volume to &quot;night club loud&quot; rather than &quot;aircraft carrier runway loud.&quot;","This place is dope. Straight-up Tex-Mex like I grew up eating in Tex. You can see the grease on the plate, so you know it&apos;s good. And it&apos;s a total dive, so that makes it better. I&apos;d been on a search for great Tex-Mex since I moved here from Austin two years ago. Since Seattle is mostly Baja style and Mexican street tacos, Tex-Mex -- especially great Tex-Mex -- is hard to find. Thank gawd a coworker recommended this place. 

So far I&apos;ve tried the cheese enchiladas with rice and beans, all of which put me in a food coma. I can&apos;t even finish the damn plate in two sittings. Seriously, I get three meals outta this shit. 

The bean tostadas are on point, and somehow the tostada chips manage to stay crispy despite my ten-ish minute drive back to work with the food. Same goes for the crispy beef tacos. I live a block from a Taco Bell and a Taco Del Mar, but I&apos;ll gladly drive to Memo&apos;s instead. 

My heart doesn&apos;t appreciate it when I eat here, but my cardiologist&apos;s wallet sure does. Be mindful: This food is to die for.","Love these little inconspicuous spots!  First of all, they had apparently just undergone a renovation, so the place was very clean and tidy.  The counter area was very colorful and vibrant, but the rest of the restaurant was pretty sparsely occupied with tables.  LOTS of potential though!  
I got the shredded beef burrito which was delicious!  However, I soon realized that it had a pretty salty aftertaste.  The flavor was amazing, but I think they may have added too much salt that day.  
Also, the fountain drink machine wasn&apos;t working so I got a warm Coke instead.  Not the end of the world either way.  
So it sounds like they have a few kinks to work out, but the potential here is huge.  I might come back for an update in a couple months to see how it has come along.  Still recommend!","Memos is always the place to go for late night food. I always get the Washington burrito, and their hot sauces pair fantastically. Red one is spicy, green is mild, both great! Listen, it&apos;s 24 hours and cheap so don&apos;t set your bar too high, but it is still delicious!","I got a door dash order from this place, so I can only comment on the taste and order.

I&apos;d be giving this place a solid 5 stars if it was solely based on taste. I got a California burrito, and the asada was extremely flavorful. I was very surprised, probably one of the better burritos I&apos;ve had in Seattle since moving up from LA.

We also got the super nachos which came a bit soggy, (delivery, duh) but I bet they would&apos;ve been really good fresh. I still liked it.

We also got the enchilada plate. The rice was really tasty and the enchiladas were properly seasoned. I&apos;m convinced to make my way down and give this place a try in-store. 

The bad: I probably wouldn&apos;t order anything but burritos and rice from here for delivery again. They left out the flan I ordered, and we&apos;d ordered a chicken and asada enchilada, but we ended up getting both chicken. Not the end of the world, but still a little bit of a bummer. 

The salsa was zero levels of spicy. Tasty, but I wish they had one salsa that burned your face off.","The food was not impressive. The chili relleno had hard inedible seeds in it and it was not flavorful. The guacamole is very bland. The burritos are flat, rectangular, and floppy. The tacos are marginal at best. To top it all off, I&apos;ve gotten sick and had some sort of gastrointestinal distress from the food every single time.","Gotta give it a 4 star because they are open 24/7! I came here with a friend after all the bars were closed in downtown and I was craving carne asada fries at 3:30am. We really took a $20 Uber (one way) just to come out here and eat some carne asada fries. I still think about how ridiculous that decision was but nonetheless it happened so.. #noregrets. 

The carne asada fries were pretty decent.. I&apos;m originally from LA so there&apos;s no way this compares but it was decent. Total came out to be about $9 for fries topped with carne asada, cheese, sour cream, and some sort of Chile verde sauce? 

The university of Washington is pretty close by so I feel envious that they have such a convenient 24 hour Mexican place so close to their campus.","Worst place ever I just ordered Uber eats on them and I received my order got beef on my veggie taco, chicken taco and carne fries which I asked them SPECIFICALLY DO NOT ADD BEEF. I called them briefly after this problem I asked them &quot;may I please speak to your manager you messed up my order&quot; they told me there&apos;s no manager I run the kitchen it&apos;s only me and hung up on me and I&apos;ve called them 5 times now and they have dodged and declined my calls. I raised a complaint with Uber and they will be reaching out to the owner of that unprofessional, very rude business. They need to be shut down, I heard the lady talking Spanish to the guy and he tried to talk to me in Spanish and was very rude to me after I asked to speak to a manager and he said no no one is here to mess up order and hung up and now they&apos;re ignoring my calls? Haha have fun getting business.","Food is average, decent at best. The 2 stars is for the customer service. I have came multiple times to this location and been served by one of the females working there. Each time I have ordered she was rude, abrupt and unfriendly. Didn&apos;t bother greeting me when I approached, didn&apos;t bother listening to my order causing them to get it wrong. And when I asked for hot sauce she acted like it was the biggest burden in the world for her to accommodate me. I liked the food enough to come back but won&apos;t be returning because of her shitty service.",I had the worst experience.. I ordered Tacos (shrimp tacos ) and I asked well done shrimp. If anything the shrimp is still frozen and the only thing they had on the tacos was rice and shrimp.  I called in to tell them they pretty much didn&apos;t care at all.,"Seriously screw this place !! Employees don&apos;t wear mask for some weird reason !!The dudes that work there are super beyond rude this isn&apos;t the first time either!! I figured I&apos;d give it a break for min and see if things would get better but no  !!. I just left the restaurant moment ago , there was a mix up in my order they had no ideal what was going on  . The guy would ask me a question then immediately start talking to another guy up over me. Never tried to fix the issue the guys could literally  not care any less if he tried to.  He literally threw a burrito down and walked away !! Seriously never met a bigger bunch douche bags working at a place. 
P.S. If you wanna make fun of guest and call them stupid in Spanish make sure no other guest can speak Spanish ,and understand what you&apos;re saying!!","This place was questionable as soon as I walked in, I decided not to risk it and get something without any meat, so I got the vegetarian burrito. Well it was good on my first bite, and then on my second bite I got a nicely cooked hair. I would suggest getting 7-11 nachos before going here.

**unable to post videos I took of mess inside**","So, this is a complicated review, which spans maybe 30 visits over the course of a year or so.. The first time I went into Memo&apos;s, there were homeless people sleeping in the dark unlit corners of the restaurant, people begging for change from the patrons in line, and an article in the paper about some criminal activity be it a drug bust, a stabbing, or other unsightly going-ons. The tables were scarred with graffiti, and filthy, and finding the red cap to a needle on your seat was never outside of the realm of possibility. They also frequently ignored requests to have some ingredients removed, say you didn&apos;t want guac, you&apos;d ask for &apos;no guac&apos; and you&apos;d get home with guac in your food anyways.
I used to take my best gal to this place, and it kinda became &apos;our place&apos; despite being a den of sin, and after we broke up, I just kinda didn&apos;t go there for a couple months till one day I was passing by and just felt like a big greasy hangover shattering burrito.
I was shocked when I went inside! The place was brilliantly lit, and the cavelike booths were gone! The place looked clean, and there weren&apos;t any undesirable type folk begging for money while you waited in line.
I&apos;ve intentionally avoided touching on customer service because I&apos;m not sure what staffing has changed recently considering the length between my visits, but the young lady that took my order was very friendly and I&apos;d consider the visit a positive one.
In the past, you really couldn&apos;t tell if they understood you any, which may have been why orders were constantly wrong, or requests to have some ingredients removed went ignored.. It&apos;s kinda freaky to imagine all the allergy related lawsuits this place could have been hit by if someone with a life threatening allergy had their request ignored/not understood.
ANYWAYS- Atmospherically, this place is a million times better. It looks like an entirely different place, I cannot impress this enough, I&apos;d actually legit bring my own mother or father to this place without worry of a thing now. I&apos;ll try to add some pictures so you can see the crazy transformation!","I can finally say it! I have found the best comparison I have found in Seattle to a San Diego burrito! And in the U-District? AND cheap?! I&apos;m in burrito heaven.

A friend of mine who&apos;s also from CA recommended Memo&apos;s as a solid and cheap option for a burrito craving after school. I figure, why not? I wasn&apos;t going in with high expectations, I had come to terms with the reality that burritos in Seattle would not match the burritos in Southern California, but oh man... I was taken for a surprise!

My friend recommended the &quot;Washington Burrito,&quot; which I thought was clever as it seems to be a homage to the common California Burrito - carne asada with french fries. Let me tell you - it was pretty dang tasty and filling! And for 6$?! I&apos;m sold. Not only that, my friend boasted about their salsa bar and I was shook to realize that they WERE in fact authentic - spicy, delicious, and full of flavor.

In addition, the restaurant is open 24 hours and located conveniently near the U-District bars... perfect for late night cravings, if you know what I mean ;-)

So why the 4 stars? While it was a tasty burrito, and inexpensive... still not 100% comparable to the classic California Burrito. There could&apos;ve been more flavor and substance to the burrito and the ambiance of the restaurant could be a little more inviting. Nevertheless, I&apos;m excited to find somewhere with burritos that remind me enough of home! :-)","Do not use the Grubhub app to order food from this place. Their menu and the grubhub menu online do not match up. You mayl be surprised by what you get. I ordered a breakfast dish that is served all day according to grubhub menu. 
Apparently the University district store did not get the message. They do not serve the breakfast items. If you click on a breakfast item they will send you somethings else. It&apos;s not their problem it is the problem of whomever is uploading content.  Call the restaurant directly and do not use the  gurbhub menu.","Was told that this place was the best approximation to SD mexican food. It is indeed more like it than other restaurants I have been to in Seattle, but it is still not yet there. I am not sure what is missing, so this review may not be very constructive...perhaps it is better served as a note to myself.","This place came highly recommended by a few people so we decided to finally give it a try. We ordered the D&apos; La Santa Parrillada for take out, which includes a few types of meat (chorizo, carne asada, chicken, short ribs) as well as some tortilla. Everything was extremely well packaged and super flavorful! The chorizo was unfortunately pretty dry and cold by the time we got home. My favorite was their short ribs and carne asada. They were both flavorful, tender and some of the best I&apos;ve had! Would highly recommend ordering individual meats vs the parrillada combo unless you want to try everything.

While this place was definitely worth picking up from, I can&apos;t wait to try it again while eating at the restaurant and the meats comes straight off the grill.","I&apos;ve tried 4 different entrees and a couple appetizers here and they&apos;re all incredible. The prices seem too low--kinda fancy interior, quality/interesting food, and an entree is like $13(?!?!). I&apos;ve only gotten takeout because COVID, but everything reheats really nicely and easily.

I strongly recommend the chile en nogada if you&apos;re not sure what to try!","These folks are serving ridiculously amazing meals that they pack with care. When I eat them at home, the only thing missing is the experience of having wonderful in-person service and the special plates they use. I miss eating here in person but they&apos;re doing so well during COVID, great job!","Anything good I can say about this restaurant will not suffice.
Dream steak house! Amazing food and ambience and quite affordable quality steak offered. 
Food here is low carb/keto friendly, they offer lettuce wraps instead of tortilla. 
Definitely order the Margarita which is served in a unique bowl.","Came on a Wednesday night for dinner with a friend and I came in at 6 PM to get seated and there was no wait! But there was definitely a lot of people already inside eating and people coming in. Before I get into the food and service, can I just say they have a NICE A** bathroom! It&apos;s clean and it doesn&apos;t smell... definitely matches the vibes of tHis place in general!

The service is fantastic, I waited a bit for a friend and they were always checking up on me to see if I wanted anything to drink and if I was doing okay. 

The food.. for sure on the pricier side compared to a taco truck. BUT if you&apos;re coming here, you&apos;re paying for quality food and the food is definitely the fine dining Mexican experience. When you sit down, they give you a platter of taco assortments and water/menus are immediately placed at yo table. We ordered the the platter of taco meat and I really enjoyed the carne asada and the chorizo! The chicken was definitely on the dry side and the al pastor as well... not a favorite. 

TIP: IF YOURE COMING HERE, GET THE CARNE ASADA!","Wowza

Our group of 5 waited for 45 mins for a table on Saturday night but it was totally worth it! Loved their salsa selection (servers also promptly re-filled salsas upon request) and the awesome grilled meats. This place is 100% keto friendly as they can provide lettuce wraps in replacement tortillas.","Hands down one of the most authentic and flavorful mexican restaurants in the greater Seattle area. I&apos;m constantly recommending this restaurant and bringing guests from out of town here in a thinly veiled guise for why I need to go back. Incredible atmosphere and waitstaff makes this a true gem. Great spot for date night or catching up with a few friends. 

Space is limited and this is a very popular spot, so plan accordingly. Definitely worth the wait if they can&apos;t seat you right away.","If you don&apos;t order the ribeye tacos, YOU&apos;RE  DOING  IT WRONG!! I was surprised that there weren&apos;t more reviews on these tacos, because these suckers are legitimately SO GOOD. I  order mine medium rare, and they typically come out closer to medium, but the steak is tender, juicy, flavorful and honestly one of the best things you can sink your teeth into in this city. 

Each table always has complimentary toppings (eg salsa, pico, cilantro) but make sure to ask for the habanero hot sauce that isn&apos;t automatically given out if you want something spicier to top things with. This hot sauce is a family recipe, and it has a delayed onset sweet/tangy flavor. 

Although the above are amazing, the next best things I&apos;ve had here are the carne asada (very flavorful) and the cochinita pibil (tender in a nice citrus marinade). The carne is overpriced for what it is, and I&apos;d recommend getting the ribeye tacos instead and saving yourself $12-$15.

One potentially controversial opinion: the chips aren&apos;t good here and the Chile en nogada is overrated. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the latter isn&apos;t bad, it&apos;s just not as life-changing as what other people say in their reviews.

I&apos;ve also tried the rice pudding here - solid with the right amount of sweetness but VERY thick cream, so don&apos;t get this unless you want something denser for dessert.

Last tips I have are to 1) wear something you don&apos;t mind picking up a smell on, because the place can get pretty smoky 2) opt for another spot if you&apos;re trying to accommodate foodie vegetarians. This place is really more of a meat-lover&apos;s paradise and 3) dine here if you like ballard&apos;s asadero - this place is as good as or better from a food and ambience perspective.","Great food served in an authentic style with the &quot;family style offering of additions&quot; like pickled veggies and salsas. Nice to have vegetarian options on the menu that go beyond a salad, (the nopale, grilled cactus) especially when the alternative core menu is steak. Family run restaurant with the owners as the chefs and their children serving tables. 
I haven&apos;t seen him for several months so maybe he went off to college, I always forget to ask, but the young man who worked here was always a pleasure. His sisters are good also, they still work here. 

If you like to drink, get one of the cocktails. The margarita comes in a fun pumpkin shell, that&apos;s carved with a Mexican design, it&apos;s always a treat for visiting family but still delights me. And yes, I recommend the Nopale dish or the pomegranate for more unique, if you want something without meat.",This restaurant makes me love Mexican foods more than ever before.  I brought my family there last The foods is fresh and delicious,"Yummy food in a festive environment. Great service and, did I mention tasty food? The margaritas are great and served in a gourd-- which is a fun twist. They are huge &amp; pretty boozy but not too sweet. Delish!

Even on a Sunday evening the wait for a larger party (7) was quoted at 50 minutes. We grabbed a beer at the Roanoke down the block while we waited &amp; our table was ready much more quickly than quoted.","We ordered takeout here for my boyfriend&apos;s birthday recently, as we wanted something a little more upscale to celebrate during quarantine. We were both thoroughly impressed by the quality of the Carne Asada and the Portobello Mushroom dishes despite not being able to eat them &quot;fresh off the grill&quot; via takeout. The portions were very large as well - plenty of leftovers. I&apos;m a bit of a guacamole snob too and tend to dislike takeout guac to my own, but found theirs to be delicious. 

We were also able to get some margaritas for takeout under the current pandemic restaurant rules and they were BIG and delicious. Way more than what I would have expected for the cost - made for a nice bday treat for my boyfriend. Looking forward to dining in with them once the pandemic subsides!",Just ordered takeout through Ubereats. I was surprised by the yummy sides that came with it. Ordered lettuce instead of tortillas. Will definitely order again soon!,"Great hospitality. A family owned gem their queso fondido was amazing !!! And I had the rib eye!!!! So perfect, I didnt realize I loved cactus. Only issue is the hot plates the steaks are served on. Order them rare if you like me rare or take the steak off the hot plate immediately.","Came here for the third time tonight. Consistently delicious food and attentive service. As soon as you sit down they bring you a garnish platter which is the prettiest thing. Even when it&apos;s busy we&apos;ve had multiple servers come by to talk to us!

The value is amazing here. For apps we ordered the jalape√±o poppers. Three large poppers with cream cheese and bacon for $4.99! Can&apos;t go wrong. I ordered &quot;light tacos&quot; for my meal tonight which is 3 tacos of your choice with lettuce wraps and it was a ton of filling per meat! I really liked the carne asada! My husband got the pollo asada for $16 which was huge and he had a bunch of leftovers. We&apos;ve also ordered the tacos for 2 before which is also a great deal for only $32.

Margs are also quite good here. Not too sweet! Tonight I ordered the cab and liked it. Was a fruitier cab but went perfectly with the tacos!

We will be back again and again!","Food was creative, authentic, and overall excellent, servers were friendly, atmosphere is welcoming, service was on the slow side.  We will definitely go back and recommend it.","This place is good. Really good. Start to finish, everything exceeded expectations. We started off with a margarita, and it was presented in a bowl. I generally don&apos;t like salt with my margarita but they used a very high quality salt was went perfectly with the drink. Definitely one of the best margaritas I have had. 

Then there was their food. The reason to come here is for their meats. They have Waygu beef carne asada and that was my favorite. We also got the short ribs, bone marrow, and shrimp tacos, which were all amazing, but the carne asada had the best flavor and will be a repeat order for me. They don&apos;t take reservations so come a little early, but we were seated immediately on a Saturday night so you can get lucky","Love love love this restaurant, the food, and the sweet Mexican family that runs it with passion and love. This is truly an amazing Mexican asadero, and everything is absolutely delicious. The steaks are gigantic, and delicioso! 
Take out was packaged perfectly and we enjoyed the meal to the fullest, and we have a whole bunch of leftovers for huevos rancheros tomorrow! It&apos;s a gem of a restaurant that you must try!",Amazing.   Such flavor.  A traditional Jalisco Mexico experience.  The Carne Asada tacos are to die for.   Guacamole yummy!!! Ok starving... going back again tonight!  Can&apos;t wait!,Yummy food and good service. The guacamole was delish. Chips needed salt but were very fresh. They set down a beautiful try of toppings when you get seated. Watch out! The salsa in the middle is hot! I had a chicken quesadilla and it was so good. My daughter had something I can&apos;t pronounce...thick homemade corn tortilla covered with poblanos and cheese. She loved it. We were too full to try desserts.,I love this place! I go at least once a week. Great folks who work there and my favorite burrito in seattle!!,"Taco truck next to a gas station. I got a carne asada super burrito and some tacos. 

Convenient location, although had to deal with some guy screaming because the gas station next to the truck wouldn&apos;t let him use their microwave. It&apos;s a risk you take with being on Aurora.

Super burrito is hefty but almost all beans and rice, would not recommend. The tacos are pretty good, regular street tacos priced at $2 per taco. The red salsa is real hot and real good. Adobada taco was the best but can&apos;t complain about the chicken or carnitas.

Check this place out if you want some tacos. It&apos;s alright!","AMAZING! Friendly service and huge portions for a low price. Each dish was served with a salsa too. I got a carne asada burrito, it was delicious. Friends got a torta and tacos. All were fantastic. Would completely recommend.","Before heading out, we wanted one last fix of Mexican. We randomly spotted El Naranjo, a food truck, that is located right beside a Shell gas station. It&apos;s also close to popular Green Lake. 

We dropped in on a Saturday afternoon (around 3:00pm). It was busier than we expected. Two picnic tables outside to sit at with a nice attached awning to provide some shade. 

The menu is short and sweet with just over a dozen options. They also had a couple specials.

- Sauces - there were two bottles on the table. Green sauce and a red sauce; both were simple and unmemorable.
- 4x Tacos - we went with the asada ($1.75 US), pollo ($1.75 US), lengua ($2.00 US) and tripa ($2.00 US). The best taco was the lengua which was the most tender. The asada was unfortunately dry. The pollo was okay; interesting that it was chopped in small cubes. The tripa wasn&apos;t crunchy enough and completely over salted. 
- Enchiladas (#11) ($8.27 US) - we opted for adobada. The plate also comes with rice, beans, shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream. The enchilada texture itself was oddly dry. The sauce was completely bland and flavourless. Rice and beans were standard fare.

Sadly, EN didn&apos;t hit the spot. It had all the makings to be a gem but under delivered. 2.5 stars.",what a nasty woman you have working there with her face of few friends look for another person who wants to work,"This dependable Mexican food truck always comes through. And the best part for me are the beans and rice made homemade-style. This is my starting point for assessing any Mexican food establishment: the traditional food staples are done well. 

Everything I&apos;ve had here has been made with care. Plus, the three tacos plate special is a great bargain @ $5.99.

Tip: charges less than $5 with a credit card have $0.50 added.","Solid option if you are around the green lake area. Coming from a San Diegan transplant, the flavors and execution are authentic, although the quality of ingredients could be better. The carne asada was decent but the pork adobada stole the show. My wife got a bean n cheese burrito that was delicious, although the cold cheese was added to the burrito late in the cooking because it was still cold in the hot burrito. All in all worth a stop.","This place is just okay, I&apos;ve definitely been to better Mexican food trucks. I had the chicken and steak tacos as well as the nachos. The chicken and steak taco meat wasn&apos;t all that great, it wasn&apos;t too tasty. The green spicy sauce that you can ask for makes it better,  it goes well with the tacos. The nachos were topped with artificial tasting cheese, which tasted like something from Taco Bell or other &quot;Mexican&quot; fast food chains, not authentic tasting whatsoever. The best part of the nachos were the topped jalape√±os, that is if you like spicy food. 
This is a good place if looking for a quick bite in the area for a cheap price, it is right across from Green Lake. I probably wouldn&apos;t come here again, the food didn&apos;t taste authentic like other food trucks.","I just did my first open water swim in 2014 yesterday in Greenlake! 

After a scary, short swim by the shore, a group of us headed over to El Naranjo from the bathhouse theater parking lot. Well, since I didn&apos;t work out as hard as the rest of my peers, I decided just to get two chicken tacos. 

I am telling you, taco trucks are the best! I wasn&apos;t not that hungry. My two tacos really fed me well. Just slight bigger than my palm, very well-marinated chicken, and nicely-toasted tortilla. I loved it! I wish I could have eaten more! But, again, I didn&apos;t deserve it this time!

I will have to overcome the fear of open water and come back for a HUGE meal!","I keep tormenting myself trying to find decent Mexican food in Seattle.

The other Yelpers who have been here must never have had actual Mexican food.

The meats are very reheated and taste of nothing but salt. They all tasted kind of the same actually. Salty and dry. Adobada should taste like pineapple. Carne Asada should taste like beef. All my tacos tasted like salt. 

The salsa that came with it was from a jar. Seriously? No salsa fresca, amigos?

And, my daughter got charged $5 for a bean and cheese burrito that would be ashamed to serve if I owned a restaurant. Nothing homemade. Terrible cheese blend. Tortilla barely heated on the flat top.

PNW is oh so very white, and, sadly, it&apos;s non-white-people restaurants cater to the lowest common denominator. There is no way this place could stay in business a week in San Diego, Los Angeles, Tucson, etc.

Just stay away. Unless, you&apos;re from Washington state in which case you&apos;ll probably rate this place 5 stars and say how bomb the food here is.","I ordered the three tacos with a coke and it all came out to less than $7. That was a super  great deal! 

The tacos I chose were carnitas, adobada and chicken. The seasoning on the meat was good and made the meat tasty. The rice and beans were ok.","My husband and I came here a few years ago before moving out of Washington state. We loved the food. We recently moved back and decided to take a walk around Greenlake. We were so excited that this taco truck was still there so we rewarded ourselves with some after walking around the lake two times. We were not disappointed. We both got the 3 tacos beans and rice special and my husband also got a Jarritos. The total was just over $13! I got a carnitas (shredded pork), Asada (beef), and a pollo (chicken) taco and my husband got two asada and one carnitas. All were delicious. We even thought about getting something else to go for dinner because it was so good!

The food came out quickly and they even take cards for payment (0.50 charge for under $5.00). Oh and they are closed on Sunday! Go try it! You won&apos;t be disappointed!",This food was so bad I threw it out after 4 bites. The meat was dry and overcooked. The tortilla was so rubbery I could not cut through it. (The fork and knife they provided broke as I trying to take a bite.) The beans were soupy and mostly lard. And the whole plate was cold. I threw it away. HUGE waste of $9.,"Great Mexican truck.
The food is good and pretty fast. The folks working it are friendly. I find it fresh and a very good value.","El Naranjo is hands down my favorite food truck this side of the Sound.
Quality food, always tastes fresh, and the staff is very friendly. Orenzio is good peoples!

The tacos are perfect, the burritos hefty and satisfying, and I challenge you to find a better torta in Seattle. The meat selection is great anyway you go: carne asada, chicken, carnitas, etc., try them all, as well as their homemade sauces.

Very reasonably priced, and conveniently located at the northiest part of Greenlake.


Viva El Naranjo!
(Credit cards now accepted $5 min)","Pretty nice location right next to green lake so if you want a bite after hanging out at the lake this could be an affordable option. As for the food, I got the tacos (which came in sets of 4) in chicken and pork. The pork was actually really yummy with moist, juicy shreds and paired deliciously with the green salsa. The chicken on the other hand was not my favorite. They were cut in small cubes and seasoned in some kind of reddish seasoning that didn&apos;t do much for the flavor. My friend got a taco combo with rice and beans but the rice and beans tasted like they were straight from the can. Not the best food but you get what you pay for I guess.",Have only had the tortas with Carne Asada. They are delicious. Every time I drive past this place I have to stop and get another torta.,A good local spot for a quick bite.  The tripas are great and it&apos;s one of the only places I&apos;ve found that does them at all. The Lengua and Steak are above average. I was not impressed by their chicken or salsas. I keep it simple with taco plates and have been satisfied on each trip.,Ordered the burrito plate and the first bite tasted horribly of expired cheese. My wife tried it and confirmed the cheese had turned. How difficult is it to check the quality of one of your most basic ingredients before serving it to a customer?,"$0.99 tacos? Uno mas!! 

Stopped by for a snack and tried their tacos al pastor. Pretty good, not the best I&apos;ve had but I love that it&apos;s in my neighborhood. Tasty homemade sauces as well. I&apos;ll be back to try their tortas! 

Located in the Shell gas station parking lot. Cash only.","Based on my experience here I need to award five stars. I was out running errands and needed to buy plantains, so I thought Mendozas would be a good bet. I ordered food to pick up as well. As soon as I walked in, I saw a giant stack of plantains, so I knew I came to the right place.

I ordered huaraches, two for $10. The huaraches are delicious masa &quot;sandals&quot; topped with beans, nopales and cheese. I could only eat one at it was delicious, I&apos;ll save the second for lunch tomorrow.  I also got champurrado because it&apos; was a rainy December day. 

This mercado is small but has a warm atmosphere, it has everything you need, from a wall of spices, cases of cheese and salsa, ceramic mugs and bowls, and yes, a mound of platanos by the register.  I live nearby so I&apos;ll be coming here more often now that I&apos;ve found this gem of deliciousness.","I&apos;m not a huge review guy, but I do sit down and take the time when someone or someplace has gone out of their way to make an experience great and I literally just sat down at my computer as soon as I got home to write this. First off, my daughter and I walked in there (masks on during COVID times) and we were greeted with somebody behind the counter taking a Mendoza&apos;s branded mask out of plastic packaging and handing it to us. He saw that we already had a mask, but gave us a free one anyhow and we&apos;re happy to represent their brand around town! They had everything I was looking for to make Birria tacos where I was substituting beef for goat and serving with a side of consomme. And then when I told him what I was making, he told me to make them and then come back and try them there at the mercado when they make them every Saturday! So he was encouraging me to go ahead and make them myself with the ingredients from the mercado but to come back and try them and compare notes on another Saturday when their cafe makes them with true lamb and goat. The kindness and unassuming &quot;above and beyond&quot; made me want to go home immediately and write a positive review. If I can convince even just a single shopper to go there either for pantry/produce/meat items or to go get a prepared meal, I&apos;ll feel like I&apos;ve at least given back something for the kindness they&apos;ve shown us. We&apos;ll be back, no doubt!","I love this mercado! I discovered it a couple of years ago and it is my &quot;go to&quot; place for all things Mexican, from lunch time take-out, to groceries, to pi√±atas. For starters, Carlos and his wife are incredible friendly and helpful. Mendoza&apos;s has authentic home-style take-out food with special menu items depending upon the day of the week. The food MUST be great because at lunch time Mendoza&apos;s is busy with hispanic workers buying lunch. The food isn&apos;t Taco Bell variety or something you&apos;d order in a Seattle &quot;Mexican&quot; restaurant. It is food that rivals the great food you&apos;d find in someone&apos;s home kitchen. It is that good and worth a detour. Some of my simple favorites are the tamales. The green chili and chicken tamales are filled with chicken - and not mostly masa like the tamales sold at other take out restaurants. The steam table has options I&apos;ve never seen or eaten outside of Mexico. Also, this is the only place I have found REAL Oaxacan cheese from Oaxaca. It has an incredibly earthy flavor and is great in cheese quesadillas. There is NO comparison between this authentic cheese and domestic versions of Queso Oaxaca. Lastly, the fresh sour cream (from Mexico!) is the closest thing I have had yet to the jocoque (a type of cultured sour cream) I have eaten in Mexico. The stuff is phenomenal. Eating it would be like comparing real heavy cream to Cool Whip.","Truly a magical place! I bought some of their freshly made queso fresco, salsa verde, and flour tortillas last time I went (plus $60 worth of other yummy items) and was beyond pleased with the taste and quality. Great customer service, too. I&apos;ll be trying their menudo next. 

I moved to Seattle from Texas, where &apos;mercados&apos; are a given. I&apos;ve struggled to find a place close to home because I live in Lower Queen Anne, but this place knocks it out of the park. I&apos;ll be back!","I was have been wanting to go to a Mexican market in Seattle. Not many options so I came to check out Mendoza&apos;s Mercado. The prepared food was overpriced and definitely needed flavoring. 

They didn&apos;t have a large selection of vegetables. All vegetables that they sold could be purchased at a Safeway for a cheaper price. 


The other items that they sold, such as Mexican candy or other goods, were not priced. You had to ask the price of each item or else you would not know the price of the item you were paying. 

They said they would email me the receipt and they never did :(.","Love Mendoza&apos;s, I get all my dried chiles, hot sauce, pozole, mole and all my Colombian goodies. For anyone wondering where to get baked Colombian goods like bu√±uelos, empanadas, arepas and pan de bono (same as pan de queso), they carry these in the frozen section. Added bonus, Carlos is a sweetheart and will go out of his way to help you find or order whatever you need.",So bomb! The lunch plates are crazy good. Authentic af. Will be going again to try all their other cooked meats.,"This was my first time here. It was nice and small. They have a lot of Mexican candy options and what they say to be fresh produce. They have a range of Jarritos as well as other Latin drinks I didn&apos;t recognize. They have paletas  as soon as you walk into the store. They also have a cerniceria that seems to be pretty popular. You can order food by walking to the back of the store. They had a sign above it, but it didn&apos;t look like a menu. When I asked the person working for a menu he pointed to everything in the display case while naming it off. There were no prices shown. I ended up getting a plate of carnitas with rice and beans. 

The carnitas were good, but there was too much buche for my taste. The beans and rice were delicious! The tortillas seemed like they had been reheated more than once; the edges were hard, kind of stale.

The green salsa was spicy, but an acceptable spicy. I really liked their green salsa. I didn&apos;t taste the red salsa, just because I&apos;m a green-salsa-kind-of-person.

When we went to go pay we took out drinks because we weren&apos;t done with them. The person working there told us that we had to finish them and then we can out our bottles in the crate below the bottle opener. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s because they want the deposit or what it may be, but we felt like we were being rushed to chug our drink.

Overall, I would recommend it if you want to buy anything other than food. They also had cute signs everywhere that just made us laugh. In one way or another it made us feel at home.","great little mexican tienda with mini restaurant in back! the restaurant food is mostly stews and such kept in food warmers like you would have in supermarket hot food areas.  

stufd tried

pork ribs in mole sauce plate: not the chocolate mole  but a nice savory curry like sauce.  plate comes with spanish rice and beans, both were also very good

carnitas (pulled pork): nice portion size! a tiny bit dry but i was there at the end of the night! would get again

chiles rellenos: sort of my standby dish.  tasty

chicharron ( fried pork skins) got to get this with your meal! crunchy deliciousness! 

the seating area for eating is very no frills and has no tables. there are stools and a countertop area so you can sit and eat.  i like how you just grab your own drinks from the grocery refrigerators! folks who worked there were really nice.  menu changes a bit daily! get the sense this is more of a lunch spot and a lot of menu items were already gone by the time we got there around 630p.  would get there earlier to make sure you get to try all the options!",Wonderful market! Has all the essentials and very friendly people working there  I&apos;ll definitely be back for more tamarind candy,"This would be 3 stars if this restaurant were in Texas, but 4 stars for Seattle.

I had the birria (like a Mexican beef stew), cabeza (cow&apos;s head tacos), and carnitas (basically Mexican pork confit). All of the tacos were delicious and authentic! The first two meats were flavorful and quite juicy. The salsas they have at the bar are all flavorful in their own right -- one tasted of smoked chipotles and the salsa roja had a nice kick to it.

Only complaint was the portion size was fairly small, considering each taco was $2.80 before tax (the birria was especially skimpy, like 1/3 the meat portion of a normal taco in Texas). It seems the food had been sitting for awhile, but considering the place is a meat market cum grocery, understandable! I&apos;ll be back to buy some fresh meat and more tacos, perhaps earlier in the day.","Love love love this Mexican market! I love cooking Mexican, and Latin American food, so Mendoza&apos;s has all the ingredients my heart desires. They carry some vegetables, homemade tortillas, homemade salsas, different kinds of cheeses, whole and crushed peppers, and pan dulces. They also sell pre-marinated taco meat and well as having a little stand where they serve tacos. 

All really fair prices and the folks that work there are so sweet. Definitely my go to for Mexican cooking items. Worth checking out for sure!",Authentic Mexican food and ingredients at a great price. I was able to get the guajillo Chile peppers I needed to make enchilada sauce like my mom makes.,Absolutely delicious Chiles Rellenos. Hands down the best ones I&apos;ve found this side of the border. That have Mexican sweet bread and almost any ingredient you might need for Mexican cooking. Check them out and support a fun local business.,Very ehhh mediocre. Not many products at all and definitely not many authentic ones . Very small and dusty and expensive which is crazy for what they sell. There is no really frozen foods and very few things besides snacks . So it&apos;s hard to even call it grocery or meat market more like a corner store with some meat cuts there . They also have no prices labeled and it&apos;s bizarre and you just have to guess . They do have home cooked Mexican fair available but again with little assortment. The customer service is great you do feel welcome,"Love the tamales here the chicken and the chilies and cheese. They have lots of Mexican food staples like peppers, canned Hispanic brand foods, home made fresh pico, salsa green and fiery hot salsas. They also have a taco, tamale, Chicharron and other Hispanic soups like what looks like posole, and what I thought was menudo. They have lots going on here. Everything I have had so far is delicious!","Ordered a carnitas plate and a Chile relleno. The carnitas were fantastic as well as the beans. However the rice was extremely garlicky. Generally the rice is the first thing to go on my plate but I left it. Also my relleno was stone cold. When I got ready to pay I told him that is was cold and thought he wouldn&apos;t charge me for it since we didn&apos;t eat it due to it being cold. On the contrary I paid 21$ for 1 carnitas plate, a cold Chile relleno I didn&apos;t consume, and a small coke. The only good things: carnitas, beans, and a clean tienda, but definitely not worth the money or the hype.","The tamales are delicious, amazing, and authentic. Customer service was excellent and there&apos;s a wide variety of Mexican products. I will definitely come back again.",Simple and good. Adding more salsa with chips would improve.  I like the tamales. Everything is good. You can get 8 oz Mexican cokes too.,"A wonderful surprise to find visiting Seattle! I wanted to make my sister dinner and needed a Mexican market. Well, this place was wonderful and the gentleman at the counter/cashier was great!","I really want to try something else here, but I love the vegan nachos so much, it&apos;s the only thing I can speak on.
Pre-Covid, I&apos;ve been here a few times and the vibes were good, the hot sauce (in perfect little squeeze bottles) was delicious, and the food was excellent.
Post-Covid, we dined on NYE and another occasion outdoors under heaters. And recently just did delivery.
My fianc√© loves the tacos, which I swear some day I&apos;ll try, but I gotta say the vegan cheese sauce wins me, and the healthy portion of guac means I keep ordering the same thing over and over.
I&apos;m guessing the chips are house-made b/c they are thick and wonderfully crunchy in that homemade type of way, and the salsa that starts with a &quot;c&quot; is delicious and tangy.
For upscale-feeling mexican food, I highly recommend!","Super cute restaurant located in fremont! They have a nice area for outdoor seating and they&apos;re opened inside currently!  

I got the street corn which is delicious and the steak and pork taco. I asked for pork belly but I guess he heard just pork but that&apos;s ok it was still good. 

Their chips and salsa is also super good, get the hottest salsa which I believe is the habanero. It&apos;s not as spicy as you&apos;d think it&apos;s be but it&apos;s sooo good.","Big props to PYP for their covid safety protocols! Enjoyed a meal of chips and guac, ceviche, and some yummy spicy mule in their patio seating. It wasn&apos;t crowded, all staff wore face coverings, and there was heating above our table. Plus for nice smelling hand sanitizer at the entrance! 

Tip: they do have some indoor seating available as well on first come first serve. (We didn&apos;t use it but saw two groups sitting indoors, far apart from each other.)","It took about an hour to get a table because the people who cashed out wouldn&apos;t leave their tables. You&apos;d think they&apos;d be a little more considerate considering the capacity a restaurant can hold.

The food was definitely mediocre. For a Mexican restaurant... it definitely did not taste like good Mexican food quality. 

We ended up waiting 20 minutes AFTER receiving our food to get enough attention to get utensils, so you can see in my photo passing my roommate my used spoon from eating my soup. 

Overall, it&apos;s very busy here for lower quality than expected. Probably won&apos;t return.","They have outfit seating, drinks were great, and excellent service! All the food was delicious and we also got nachos, but ate it all of it too quickly :) 

I would recommend this place to sit outside as long as you can handle the cold a little bit. We went while it was rainy, but it was a blast to eat under the heaters and with candlelight","Great ambiance, great tacos, even better margs!! Definitely a great place to come on a sunny day in seattle!","COVID Review - 12/21/20
When we walked up to the restaurant we were impressed by the warmth of the heat lamps, and by the warmth of the wait staff. Eddie was enthusiastic in his service and recommendations. We ordered margaritas, the starter appetizer bundle (corn, taquitos, nachos, chips/salsa/guacamole), and a series of tacos. Everything was excellent. The vegan nachos are truly mind blowing - our crew was not vegan, but may consider it after these nachos. 

The Covid setup is functional and enjoyable. If the tequila from their blue ribbon margaritas isn&apos;t enough to warm your soul... all of their outdoor seating has newly installed heaters near every table. Such a great addition! So, Cheers to a evening out of the house. Paublo y Paublo... it was bueno y bueno.","Soft crab tacos were good and still crispy-ish after a 20 minute drive home, being packed in egg carton-type paper boxes for take-out. Fish tacos, street corn, and guacamole were also tasty. 

I got a random &quot;Heavy Restaurant Group&quot; gift card from work for 50 bucks and decided to use it for take-out from Pablo Y Pablo, otherwise I would have never even come here; it&apos;s really off my regular route from Carkeek to Lake Union.

But despite decent food, I will never EVER return to this place, not even for take-out. Let me explain.

When I first arrived at the outdoor host stand, my ears were assaulted by the most detestable music being blasted throughout the patio.  

I use the word &apos;music&apos; in the loosest sense of the word; what I heard was some type of hateful, discordant rap-style racket in which the vile &quot;N-WORD&quot; was repeatedly recited over and over and over again. 

How could any establishment in the year 2020 choose this kind of deplorable, hate-filled &quot;music&quot; for its ambiance? I just wanted to pay quick and get the hell out of there. 

Shame on PYP for its disturbing and dreadful judgment. Who could sit and relax while being forced to listen to such repugnant and abhorrent noise?

I&apos;ll never come back here.","I was overall very impressed with the food quality and service. We got the nachos to share, which are HUGE and very tasty. The pineapple, bacon taco was amazing and extremely flavorful. We got our food very quickly, and the overall service was great, including their covid precautions. Numerous tables outside spaced apart. I would definitely come again.","Step above Chipotle style concept with burritos, bowls, nachos, etc.

Carnitas bowl was solid - The ingredients were fresh and delicious. Guacamole was NOT extra (yippee!) and the hot sauce was delicious. My only nit is that $15 was pricey for the amount of food we got but I guess the quality makes up for it.

Food came out super quickly.","Updated review: Long overdue! Management contacted me regarding the plastic cups and they started to use glass again a few days after my last visit.  Great customer service as  always expect from HRG restaurants!

Hoping COVID goes away and HRG restaurants are able to survive and open whenever that is.  I believe right now (January 2021) P y P has outdoor seating so will visit them very soon.  Along with Barrio, favorite Mexican restaurant in Seattle and amazing cocktails!

Thank you HRG and best of luck!!","Love this place! The blood orange margaritas are my all time favorite. The service is always excellent and they have great outdoor seating with heaters. The charred broccoli tacos and vegan nachos are great! So glad they have some decent vegan options. Beware, the vegan nachos are pretty spicy! Highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner.",Great food. The guacamole is superb - and the soft shell crab and the banh mi taco were fantastic.,"My friend and I went to Pablo y Pablo for lunch.  We showed up around 12:30 PM on a weekday and were seated immediately.  The tables are pretty close together, but it wasn&apos;t a big deal.

As an appetizer we ordered the guacamole.  I would definitely order the large if you have two people sharing.  The guac was amazing.  It was a little weird because they had huge slices of serrano peppers on the top (my arch enemy!), but it was easy to push them to the side.  The tortilla chips were also really good (and freshly made).  Our server also offered us more chips when we ran out!

For lunch we both ordered the Taco y Taco combo, which is any two tacos with a choice of small chopped salad, cup of soup, or rice and beans.  I chose the pork carnitas and spiced steak tacos with a side of rice and beans.  Everything was delicious.  I enjoyed the pork taco more than the steak taco, but my friend felt the opposite way.  The rice and beans were good and well seasoned.  I washed everything down with a delicious Mexican coke!

So, the food was great and our server was attentive and friendly.  The only downside is the price.  I do think it is worth it, but I probably wouldn&apos;t eat here all the time.  They also charge a mandatory 20% gratuity.  I don&apos;t know why that bothers me so much.  I usually tip 20% anyways, but I hate it when it is not a choice.  Also, I think you should always tell your customers that when they sit down instead of at the end.","We visited Pablo y Pablo after reading good reviews on it and seeing it on a couple of &quot;Seattle Tik Toks&quot;. I was really excited to come try this place out, but I have to say, it was pretty disappointing. We went on Sunday at 1:00 PM and the vibe was not what we were expecting. I understand that it&apos;s SUNDAY AFTERNOON, not FRIDAY NIGHT, but there was something missing. There just wasn&apos;t a VIBE to it. They were playing music in the background, which didn&apos;t even match the ambience of the restaurant. It&apos;s a Mexican restaurant! Why are they playing random slow/alt. rock songs in English? They should be playing something that reflects the ambience/environment that they&apos;re trying to provide. How about some Regional Mexican? Latin Pop? Reggaeton? It doesn&apos;t have to be Vicente Fernandez but at least throw on some Latin hits. On top of that, the music was going out. Not sure if it was the speakers or just bad connection. Moving on from the vibe, we go to drinks and food. Now, I read that this place is good for drinks, not the food. It seems like many people agree that the food is not as &quot;authentic&quot; in flavor and it&apos;s over-priced. I agree. We ordered the elote, which was expensive for what it was. The plate/presentation was nice, but not the flavor. We were hesitant to order more food so we left it at that. I ordered a beer, and realized they don&apos;t offer anything on tap. Really? Bottles/Cans only? I mean, there are coffee shops that have beer on tap. The cocktails were over-priced so we skipped on them. It&apos;s not a money issue, but how can a place charge so much and not deliver a good atmosphere and good quality? I&apos;m sorry Pablo y Pablo, I&apos;m not a hard critic, but this place just wasn&apos;t it for me. Reading other reviews, it seems like there are plenty of other people that really enjoy this place. If you plan on visiting, try a drink and an appetizer first. Then see if you want to stay. I&apos;m giving two stars since the restaurant is modern, clean, and nicely decorated inside. It looks like it may be a good spot for cocktails but in my opinion, nothing more.","I am a big fan of Pablo y Pablo. It&apos;s a rather fancy looking, very modern Mexican Restaurant with lots of vegan options on their menu. I have eaten here multiple times and enjoyed great meals on their Covid-friendly patio served by wonderful staff. Their vegan nachos are great, though my favorite are probably their charred Brokkoli Tacos. Definitely worth a visit!","I write this review in the context of a carryout order. We haven&apos;t eaten in here, but we get carryout all the time, probably twice per month. 

The taco&apos;s here are phenomenal. I highly recommend the fish taco. It has a light, crispy breading and the fish is always fresh and cooked perfectly. 

We&apos;ve gotten most of the other tacos on the menu. They are all delicious, but the one I&apos;d specifically like to highlight that was new when we ate there last night was the stone crab taco. I have never had a crab taco until last night, and the crispiness, flavors, texture, and garnish were all perfect. Top it with a lime and it was divine. 

We order the nachos regularly too. They are always generously covered with fresh ingredients and guacamole. The ratio of chips to toppings is correct. The chips are crispy and salty, but not overly so. 

Pablo y Pablo is great, we will continue to come back. Thanks for providing the neighborhood with great food and strong service!","Honestly feeling crazy ripped off by Pablo y Pablo right now and their management could not care less. I ordered a BOWL of their chicken tortilla soup. This is what I got. This is damn near the size of a dipping sauce cup and I paid $12 for it. It was $9 for a BOWL as listed on their menu plus tax it came out to $10 and $2 was tipped so in total $12. When I saw it in the bag, I really couldn&apos;t believe it and told the hostess I had ordered a bowl. She said there was one size, I told her their menu said there were 2 and she insisted that there was just one. I took it up with what seemed to be the manager and I asked him if I really had to pay $10 for this and he said there was one size and their menu changed. If this was the $9 option then what did the $6 one look like? Smh","I stopped by for a solo brunch and they took wonderful a care of me! Even with only three front of house on staff they handled the insanely busy brunch rush! 
Food:
I ordered the halibut ceviche with fresh chips as well as a pork and fish taco. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. Then best part was the blood orange margarita I was served while waiting for my table. 
Covid:
Outdoor seating, very clean and sanitary.","Located along the front of some corporate building, this place has a fine patio that allows dogs (very important to me).  The servers were usually good, and the food was fine.  Biggest complaint: it was a bit fusion-y, not authentic Mexican-American cuisine like you&apos;d get further south along the coast.","I love the barbacoa (lamb) tacos here! The tacos are big and with lots of meat.

Salsas are fresh and delicious!","Love this place. Authentic mexican food at very reasonable prices. We normally get one pound of carnitas and one pound of barbacoa to go, and make tacos at home.","My boyfriend and I love this place. Unfortunately, I had a bad experience today that I found something my mouth after I had a one bite of taco. I think it was bone or some tooth in my tacos. Luckily, I did not swallow it, but it hurt my upper mouth.","This place is such a hidden gem in Greenwood. Tucked in the back of a Mexican grocery store is La Conasupo. It&apos;s a no frills restaurant where you look at the menu on the board, decide what you want to eat and let the person at the counter know. She&apos;ll write the order in Spanish on a ticket and will tell you to go to the front of the grocery store to the cashier and pay. 
I discovered this place about 4 years ago and I almost missed it because it&apos;s along the main row of shops in Greenwood. If it&apos;s your first time there, I highly recommend getting the Quesadilla. It&apos;s literally the size of a half moon! Get the Quesadilla de Tinga de Res, which is shredded beef in the most amazing sauce. Add that to the cheese inside the quesadilla and it&apos;s absolute heaven...and messy. 
Since I ordered this so many times, I decided to get tacos on my latest trip. Tacos are about $6 each, so they&apos;re on the pricey side. However, these aren&apos;t your run of the mill street tacos that you can eat in one bite. They&apos;re about 2 1/2 times the size of those tacos and loaded with meat and onions and cilantro. When I ordered three, the lady at the counter warned me how big they were. The size of the tacos reminded me of the ones in LA where they just piled on the meat with several tortillas underneath. I chose Lengua, Cabeza, and Carnitas as my meats of choice, which are the top 3 I normally get. The tacos didn&apos;t disappoint. The container weighed about 3 lbs. total and I definitely over ordered. Two is enough for a hungry person. Also, beware of the red salsa. It is extremely tongue numbing hot. 
In the window is also chicharrons piled 2 feet high that they&apos;ve fried from all the meats. They&apos;re literally the size of your head and bigger, so I got a pound of those to snack on. They&apos;re a bit hard, so you probably want to use them for cooking in stews, etc. instead of eating raw. 
Next time you&apos;re in Greenwood and you&apos;re craving Mexican, make sure you stop by here and grab a quesadilla or tacos. I&apos;ll need to go back and get some consome or menudo next time I go back!",The food is great but the employees are not following law regulations. They don&apos;t wear mask specials the man at the register I think he is the owner.,"Happy to have this place nearby our house. It&apos;s a great little Mexican market with a taco shop in the back. Tacos were alright. Not big fans of the lengua as it tasted boiled and super underseasoned. Still on the hunt for some good lengua. The carnitas were good but everything could use a touch of salt. 

However the horchata here is soooo good. Like I want to buy it in buckets. But maybe that&apos;s gross. I don&apos;t care. It&apos;s that good.","This is the most authentic place in the city for Mexican market food, however its not welcoming.... most non Mexicans arrive and get intimidated and leave... my advice, it looks wired, but food is clean and delicious... give it a try",I went to eat here because I was told the barbacoa was great. But it was ok at best. The service left a lot to desire and the is nowhere to sit and wait for a table to open up. Oh and there&apos;s like 8 tables and u can barely move when you sit! Did I mention the waitresses were rude af!? Anyways the trip was not worth it.,"This place is derty, and they charge more than other places. Specially on beer. Need to be cleaned.","Went there on Sunday afternoon food is delicious, and good portions we split one taco de carnitas and a quesadilla de chicharr√≥n. The aguas frescas are sooooo tasty they have passion fruit and it was wow!!!!!! Extremely recommend if u wanna try to a good mexican food","Most authentic Mexican food you can find in the area by far. On sundays especially, this place is filled to the brim with Mexican families, half are seated, the other half are in a line that stretches all the way outside... that&apos;s how you know it&apos;s some good stuff. Hands down best (quality, quantity, taste, and price wise) quesadillas I&apos;ve had in my life, resembles more of a calzone than the Americanized quesadillas you&apos;ll see in the vast majority of places. Their tacos seem to be priced high but the quantities u get for 1 taco easily makes 2 full size street tacos and then some. A+","La Conasupo is a haven for Mexican and Latin American immigrants. 

Like many immigrant businesses, their customer service is not up to fast food restaurants. Plus, if you don&apos;t speak Spanish you&apos;ll have to put on your patience-pants to get as close to what I know as a family-cooked meal. 

Tip: hit the cooler with drink containers of horchata, guayava, and jamaica. These are not powdered-made!

Tip #2: pay up front AFTER you eat or receive your take-out. 

Tip #3: The one veggie we tried was the hongos (ie, mushroom) quesadilla. Well done and packed with lots of them.","If you are looking for authentic Mexican food from Mexico City. this is the place to go to. Their food is amazing, very tasty and plentiful. 
Menudo or Consome with one of their carnitas or barbacoa tacos smothered with their super delicious green salsa on the weekend after a night of a few drinks is the best of the best! 
If you can get over the fact that you will be seating around a pile of empty boxes, unorganized shelf&apos;s, overcrowded isles, dirty floor and not the best customer service then you will have the best Authentic Mexican food.","the food is delicious, the dishes are gigantic and the service excellent, very friendly the staff that works there, very cheap grocery productsAguas Frescas","I think I should have read the reviews more carefully: $4 seems like a lot to pay for one taco, but good lord do they make enormous tacos here. I quite foolishly ordered two. Each taco came on two rather large tortillas and the plate contained two more. Basically, you get enough meat with two tacos to make six more modestly-sized ones. You do the math: buy one gigantic $4 taco, and portion that into at least two, if not more. And yes, the red salsa is quite hot.  

So how were they? I got the carne asada, and as others have noted, they were a bit dry, although they did have the texture of tacos al barbacoa. Next time--and there will be a next time--I&apos;ll probably try the tinga de pollo quesadilla because that for sure should not be dry. Oh, and bonus points for the gigantic cups of guava drink and horchata in the back fridge, ready for the taking. 

The kitchen staff seems to speak limited English, FYI, but that&apos;s not really a hindrance to ordering or anything like that.","THIS is my best kept Seattle secret. 

Circa 2006, came here with a friend for &quot;brunch&quot;. Now, when I say &quot;brunch&quot;, it&apos;s not your typical sit down place, customize everything you want, add this, don&apos;t use that, speak in English etc. 

No, this is the most authentic Mexican brunch you will ever have in Seattle. I&apos;m serious, the hot sauce is hotter than hot, there aren&apos;t any utensils (so yes, you make your taco by picking up the fresh, hot homemade corn tortilla, using that to scoop up the meat, add your cilantro, onions, chili&apos;s, and bite into the juiciest, most authentic, overstuffed taco (that&apos;s what you&apos;ll be when you leave) you will find in Seattle.

The Sunday brunch crowd is mostly families that come after church to have a family meal. Amo este lugar. I love the atmosphere here, too. Such fun place to eat and practice your Spanish.

Also, if you don&apos;t speak Spanish at least conversationally, you probably can&apos;t get food here. It&apos;s not impossible, but it&apos;s not optimal either and the menu is in full Spanish with no more than 5 items listed. Let me help you out!

&quot;Hola, Por favor cinco tacos de carne asada (yes you want five tacos) con cebolla, cilantro, salsa picante verde y rojo (yes you want both kinds, especially the avocado green salsa). Gracias&quot;. Also this place isn&apos;t veg friendly. 

You will thank me. 

Also, if you go on Saturday, try the consomme, barbacoa (it&apos;s slow roasted, shredded lamb), and tacos dorados with crispy tortillas wrapped around spicy chiles and potatoes.The quesadillas on house made tortillas are also sososososo good. Just EVERYTHING. Eat it all. 

Just FYI, &quot;dorados&quot; means &quot;golden&quot;. You will not find better gold in taco format in Seattle ever.

Drool. 

Drool.

PS Buy the fresh adobo and chipotle chili&apos;s. Mmmmm!

Me encanta este lugar a la luna y de regreso.","So. Much. Meat. Not a bad thing, but extra tortillas aren&apos;t a bad idea. Homemade red and green salsas on the tables. I got the carnitas and thought they were a little dry, but salsa definitely fixed that. The bigger market had a ton of mexican specialty items, including COWBOY BOOTS... made my day!","Yikes.Went to the back to order some food...and while we were looking at their menu board some young woman who was mopping the floor started yelling at us: &quot;Hellooo.&quot;  &quot;Helloooo...&quot;  I said hi, she muttered something in Spanish and said &quot;helloooo&quot; again.  So I said &quot;hello&quot; AGAIN.  And once more she chimed in with &quot;Hellooo,&quot; like she was pissed off that we dared to be there looking at the menu.  I said, &quot;we&apos;re looking at the menu.&quot;  She finally gave up with a grumpy face and retreated into the bowels of La Conasupo.  At that point we decided to exit.  Between the rude attitude and the dirty surroundings, we were glad to leave.  
    Do yourself a treat and go around the corner to Gordito&apos;s.  They treat you with dignity there and the place looked like someone cared....and the food at Gordito&apos;s was exceptional.  Ciao La Conasupo!",It&apos;s my second time here and the first time was better. I got a carne asada tacos and the meet was to greasy and made it taste bad and I also got a quesadilla and it was good also a bit greasy but it had its balance with cheese and thicker outside. My bf had the consome and he didn&apos;t like the meat the flavor was off. I&apos;m sad this went from good to bad,"Here&apos;s the problem with Conasupo: Inconsistency! Sometimes their barbacoa, quesadilla, or menudo are good and sometimes the worst. How do you expect your customers to come back if we never know whether spending $50 on barbacoa would be worth it? The last 2 times my family went to Conasupo, the barbacoa was so dry and tasteless. We paid more than $50 for a Sunday lunch and it left a bad taste in our mouths. Needless to say, that is the last time we are ever going to this place.

I&apos;d rather go to Bothell for the barbacoa.","Casa Patr√≥n is a great place to go for a casual night! I used to love coming here (pre-Covid) for nights with my girl friends! We usually just stick to drinks, but I finally came and got some food so I felt like I could leave an honest review. 
First off, the variety of drinks they have is amazing! Flavored mojitos/margs are my favorite things to see at a Mexican restaurant so it&apos;s nice they have lots of those options. Last time I came I got a jalape√±o margarita and some cucumber mojitos. They were really tasty (and cheaper than a lot of other Seattle bars), but I didn&apos;t really feel all that tipsy. I ordered a chile relleno and it was pretty good too! The amount of food you get for the price is really solid, so I would say worth it. 
This place is a 4/5 star for me for two reasons. One, like I said I don&apos;t feel like the drinks are very strong. I wish they were worth the price, especially because they&apos;re really delicious! Second, I feel like while I was definitely satisfied with the food, it wasn&apos;t my absolute favorite Mexican food I&apos;ve had at a more casual spot like this one. 
That said, I highly highly recommend Casa Patron for a fun night out with friends, or a casual date night! I really look forward to coming back for those once COVID is a little better.","Love Casa Patron! We used to have a difficult time straying away from this place for Friday date nights. The staff is always super friendly and accommodating, however a little slow sometimes, but that&apos;s a Friday night for you!
We usually get a combo plate that has a taco, enchilada, and tamale which also has rice and beans. Its super cheesy and delicious and we absolutely love it. 
Rating this a 4 star instead of 5 as the takeout isn&apos;t as great as the in-restaurant experience. Also, I have ordered so many different types of margaritas here and have never felt tipsy off them. I&apos;d recommend sticking to beer!","Arrives at the restaurant at 8:00 pm I asked for a Mixed Ceviche I never arrive it is 10:00 pm and I still hope they bring the bill to pick me up since they served me a beer and I have to pay for it the waitress passes by me and it is as if  we were not here

Llege al restaurante 8:00 pm ped√≠ un Ceviche Mixto nunca llego son las 10:00 pm y a√∫n espero que traigan la cuenta para ret√≠rame ya que me sirvieron una cerveza y tengo que pagar por ella la mesera pasa junto a mi y es como si  no estuvi√©ramos aqu√≠","Food was great. Dine in seating.

Will be back for sure! 

The restaurant is very clean and the service was awesome!",Great mexican place with authentic flavors and large variety of dishes.  Lots of great spicy kicks in most dishes if that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for (i usually am).  Also fun decor and staff and a very fun bar area.  Plenty of easy parking out back.,"Their service was pretty much trash. 
The waiter didn&apos;t even bother to bring us water until after the poorly made margaritas were in front of us for a couple sips...
The other waitress got hella attitude with me over me asking could we get some water before we put our food order in... idk maybe they was just up in there having a bad day but man this experience did not make me wanna go back at all...
They got both our orders wrong (drinks, and food).
They got the price at the end of the meal wrong which to me is wild cause everything up until now was also unsatisfactory. 

To be honest the only thing saving this review and my thoughts on this establishment was that the food was good. Tacos was nice and seasoned. No stale shells. ceviche wasn&apos;t too bad either. Ima have to go back again to see if it was just those particular employees!","Be forewarned if you try to order takeout via Yelp. I placed an order tonight and even got a confirmation that my order was ready but when I arrived, the restaurant was closed. Apparently they close at 9pm (Yelp currently says midnight) but their system can automatically accept and confirm orders. GrubHub refunded my money but I wasted 45 minutes waiting for a non-existent order.","Went around 10:15pm on a Friday for a late night bite with my partner. Restaurant had a good amount of people seated, conversations were lively. Unfortunately per Washington state law alcohol cannot be serviced after 10pm, which sucks, but that isn&apos;t in control of the restaurant. I ordered camarones a la diabla and it was SO GOOD. The rice and beans had amazing flavor and the salsa on the shrimp was delightful. Definitely tasted like authentic Mexican food. My husband got a patron burrito and he also loved it. Would go back. Service was great as well. :)","I have to give Casa Patron about a 2.5-3 stars. Unfortunately, my first experience was not the best. Overall, the atmosphere and staff are nice...no qualms there. It&apos;s the food that was below average. Our expectations were not super high as I know all too well this is an &quot;americanized&quot; Mexican joint. However, I would have expected a little bit better food with a 4-star rating? 

Chips: tasted rancid...like they were cooked in oil that had sat for too long and/or at too high of a temp. It had that weird smoky smell and taste. We did not eat these after the first bites and noticing. You could smell it the entire time it sat at our table. Not pleasing. 
Salsas - actually quite good. The chunky not-as-spicy dip along with the spicer salsa all had great flavor

Meals: so-so
Ground beef was extremely greasy
Tamale...it looked like the shredded chicken was simply laid on top of the masa and not actually inside the tamale? It was so covered in flavorless sauce and cheese it was hard to tell.
Beans &amp; Rice...average.
Burrito and enchiladas...OK. Again, the sauce they cover these in did not have much flavor. Melted cheese helps I suppose. 

I would return here...maybe for a happy hour, but food was sub-par. Pricing overall was relatively cheap. Perhaps there are other options on the menu that may be better.","Food is good. Happy hour is great. 

HAPPY HOUR 2PM-6PM &amp; 9PM-close everyday 

They have extremely friendly servers and also reasonably (seattle) priced food menu items.

As soon as I came in they handed me menus and chips &amp; salsa. I ordered the taquitos on happy hour menu and it was just what I needed.","I got the patron burrito with picadillo (shredded beef) in it. Nothing special about the burrito. It was good sized but like I said, it was basic maybe a lil over salted. I will probably try again but only because it&apos;s so close and who knows, they may do another dish better","Casa Patron has quickly become my go to place for enchiladas in Seattle. I typically order the enchilada combo which comes with 2 enchiladas, rice, and refried beans. Simply delicious. I usually get 1 chicken and 1 picadillo (shredded beef) with the red sauce. It comes with a generous amount of cheese on top as well. I usually avoid getting shredded meat because I typically find it to be stringy or dried. This is not the case for these enchiladas! It not only feeds your belly, it feeds your soul. Enjoy!","Casa Patron seems like a neighborhood mexican joint frequented by locals, but isn&apos;t anything special, just another mediocre restaurant. The only thing going for them is that they&apos;re open late.

The restaurant is huge, with a lower section with a bar, and a large upper dining section. It&apos;s decorated like a traditional family mexican restaurant. A very colorful decor with a cultural ambiance. 

I tried a mezcal margarita, and that was really amazing.
However, the food leaves a lot to be desired. We found everything we had lacking in general flavor, and low quality. Starting from the chips and salsa, the salsa was runny. We tried an enchilada and veggie fajitas, and the enchilada sauce was very runny and slightly bitter, while the fajita was mostly squash and carrots, with a sprinkle of peppers. Even the rice and beans weren&apos;t good.

The service is how you&apos;d expect in a cultural setting. The servers were in general very friendly and prompt, but there was some confusion and we had three servers asking the same things. Not a big deal IMO.

Overall, the restaurant is very okay-ish. Not a place to go to when there are plenty of options nearby, but an option for late night eats.","I had the shrimp enchiladas for dinner a few days ago and it was sooooooo delicious!  If you need a Mexican cuisine fix, Casa Patron is the place to go!  I also loved their chips and salsa, nice and spicy sauce.
I will be reordering this shrimp enchilada with the rice and beans this weekend....FOR SURE!!  Who wants to cook when Casa Patron is a few blocks away!","It was a good environment and okay food, the service was very nice and friendly, would definitely drop by on the weekend",Service can be a  bit slow sometimes but the food is really good. I&apos;ve ordered something different every time I&apos;ve been since there are so many options,"This has become one of our favorite places for Mexican food and of course margaritas.  The first time we visited we had the pork chop dinner served with black beans and fluffy rice and chile relleno.  It was so delicious. We also ordered a top-shelf margarita which I should advise you only need one.  For dessert we ordered the flan which was nice and creamy just like it should be.  The second time we visited we sat at the bar and ordered a la carte cheese enchilada and taco al pastor along with a mezcal Margarita.  All were delicious, we were not disappointed. The ambiance is like a Spanish villa and the music is traditional Spanish music.  I can&apos;t wait to visit on a Saturday because they have Mariachis.  I gave a 4 star rating only because the bartender tends to ignore us and we have to get his attention but this will not deter us from coming back.",I love the atmosphere here! It&apos;s always cheerful and festive. The staff is incredible - so friendly and upbeat. It&apos;s a tad pricey but the food and drinks are delicious. The guava margarita and mojito are great but order the plum rita!,"My husband really wants me to like this place so I gave it another try and this time he asked me to try their Cuban sandwich .  I dare you putting bacon in this sandwich and forgetting about Mayo, mustard and pickles. So disappointing.","This has become our fav go to spot in the area! It&apos;s not huge and pretty low key. The servers are awesome and the food is amazing!! We come here once a month now and are happy everytime. We normally get the arroz con pollo and arroz con camarones, because it&apos;s cheesy,  tomatoe-y, and not spicy mmm. Recently I got the spinach enchiladas and OMG the spinach and red sauce combination was everything I could ask for as a vegetarian! Love this place! They also have free chips, salsa, and pico de gallo. (Little spicy)","Great tacos for a good price, super quick and served hot so it doesn&apos;t need reheating at home.","Fast and friendly service, cheap prices. You can get a big burrito for ~$8.50. Best for a breakfast burrito on the weekend or a quick lunch during the workday. The food  quality can be a little hit or miss depending on what or when you order, but overall it hits the spot when you want to crush a quick burrito.","Cheap and hits the spot in an area with few options. I paid $4.50 for a fish taco and carne asada, with free pickled veggies and salsas. The fish taco was in breaded and well flavored and the combo of the tomatoes and sauce made it really well balanced. The carne asada was pleasant but a little dry. Nothing to write home about but I will be back for the fish tacos. Right off the side of Lake City Way.","Always the best truck in the area. Great portions and friendly service. I know a lot of randoms give negative reviews to places like Monarca, but I have lived in the neighborhood for four years and give them the highest marks. This is a five star food truck offering!","I thought I&apos;d already reviewed this awesome taco truck. Whoops! I love their food, especially the Mulita. So delicious with the avocado and especially with the Adobada (marinated pork). I wish their regular salsas were spicier, but their special chipotle sauce is fantastic and has a good kick. Free pickled jalape√±os, carrots, and onions. Breakfast menu. Open 9:30am-9pm. Grab a 6-pack from the adjacent Shell station to go with your platter of tacos. They even have fish tacos and camarones and tamarind soda. AND you can call your order in advance, so no waiting outside when it&apos;s cold. What more could you ask for?","Food truck (not the nicest looking) parked in a shell gas station parking lot. Do not let that deceive you. They make good tacos. They give good portions and they are tasty. I had the pollo, adobada, carnitas, cabeza y lengua. My preference to order from here will be in this order: lengua, cabeza y pollo. But to each their own. They speak English and Spanish and are friendly. Their green salsa is better than their red. The red is thicker and has a little kick. Thought I&apos;d warn you faint of heart ppl haha. Tacos are $2 and up. They also make burritos and full plate entrees. Enjoy.",Workers are friendly and conveniently located near my apartment. They were able to accommodate my need for no dairy without any hesitation. My new go to spot ! Delicious.,Amazing taco truck! The adobada and cabeza were incredible. Fast and friendly service and lots of options in their menu. Great find. Would recommend!,"Im done w this place.  I have been coming to this truck for over 4 yrs.  Sometimes it is ok, more often than not it sucks.  Their burritos are 90% dry, crispy rice and boring whole pinto beans.  Add dry, tooth chipping scraps of charred beef and you have a big $9 pile of garbage.  I will miss their escabeche and their salsa verde, which is pretty spicy.  I wont miss the inconsistant nature of their food, their lack of avocado, or that feeling i get when i bite into a pile of garbage wrapped in a tortilla.  Shame on you, Im willing to bet NONE of you eat what you serve.  Atleast my DOG is happy.","Stopped by to get some tacos on the way home. I got the adobada (marinated pork), carne asada (steak), &amp; lengua (tongue) for ~$5. I ate the adobada and carne asada first, with just a squeeze of lime and found them to be quite lean and salty rather than flavorful.  I started adding the green (smoky &amp; slightly spicy) and the red (mild &amp; fresh) salsas, which helped make the tacos much more enjoyable and flavorably balanced. I had learned my lesson for the lengua taco and generously topped it with the remaining salsas &amp; lime - altogether it was my favorite taco of the trio. 

TLDR: Decent tacos. Add salsa(s) when eating",I used to come here a lot but the last couple of times there was a guy running the truck and things seemed off.  Last time I went I ordered a carnitas burrito to find no meat inside. I called and he offered to refund my money but I just don&apos;t want to deal with inconsistency so I will go to Loxicha Oaxacan food truck on 15th.,"Is a cheap place and I thank that, however, the employees seems to hate you and hate life :/
Also the meat was kind dry... so im not going there anymore","Delicious food - got takeout for a large group last night and everyone finished it before we knew it! Their tacos are out of this world - the pork and chicken are delicious, but the steak is out of this world. Nice people, amazing food cooked right in front of you. Such a find!!! Tip: eat it right there, hot off the grill.",Tasty and authentic Mexican food at great prices prepared very quickly by a friendly staff. The chicken tacos al pastor are ridiculously good.,"For this place to drop from a 5 to a 3 is really, REALLY saying something, and I don&apos;t take this lightly. When I write that we spent 3 months grabbing lunch or dinner here twice a week, and it decreased to the point of taking a break for a full month. I write it with an indescribable sadness. This WAS our go-to taco truck, and I was so excited to announce that on Yelp, but this update needs to be written.

The food used to be prepared with love, but with a new face something has changed for the worst. The food, which used to take 10-15 minutes to put together now seems to take 5-7, and that usually isn&apos;t a good sign. It&apos;s obvious biting into the food that the quality and freshness has suffered a hit. 

I tried it again just last night and it was prepared by a tall man with a hair net. My heart sank, because he&apos;s cooked my food before and it&apos;s disappointed me anytime. ANYWAY, the taco meat was WATERY. You ever had watery taco meat before? Me either.

Gross.","You&apos;ve messed up my order for the last time! The burrito was terrible today and not made to order. Got my $10 back and won&apos;t be returning.

The food quality has always varied and only been moderate at best. 

They charge $5 per mulitas while most other places charge $5 for 2.

The convenience of walking here isn&apos;t worth it.","Let me get this out of the way- I love Mexican food more than I love people, pets, and maybe even freedom and eagles. I thought the burritos at the Taqueria up on 196th in Lynnwood were the gold standard(and I&apos;ve had enough burritos to justify being about 300 pounds heavier than I am). In fact, I was fully prepared to offer my hand in marriage to the man who made those burritos in spite of being staunchly heterosexual. This was before I went to Monarca Express.

Yes, I live FAIRLY close to this truck. Why did it take me almost a year to go here? Why did I go to the truck in Northgate? The answer, citizens of Yelp, is because I&apos;m a sorry excuse for a human being. Consider this review a personal apology to the angel in the form of a slightly below average height Mexican man who mans this truck. The menu is not wildly different from what you might find at any other taco truck(though they offer a Chorizo burrito and don&apos;t offer tamales), but the meat....the meat.....it&apos;s the key. The way they spice it and bless it with enough flavor to hype up Public Enemy in the 1980&apos;s pretty much leaves me with an overwhelming desire to go here every day. 

This place is not the recipient of review inflation- it is that good. It&apos;s good enough to go to Lake City, and those are not words I utter or write easily.","Done Hoping For improvement.
Prices higher portions smaller quality poorer.
Went in tonight and when I got home my Mexican plate was the smallest I&apos;ve ever received..","I ordered from door dash and it said tacos $6.00, being taco(s) if figured more than 1 at least 2 especially at $6.00. well I was wrong, so I got 2, (cause I ordered 2 orders) little street tacos for $12.00!! Plus the fee for door dash I paid a total of $18.01 for 2 little street tacos.","Really enjoy visiting this food truck regularly, especially for the Adobada Pork Tacos!","Full disclosure: I have been relying on delivery services for food during this social distancing period so this review is solely for food that arrived, not a dine-in experience. 

Ordered: a pair of chicken tamales with beans and rice, plus a taco salad in a shell with minced beef. 

The tamales were good but the sauce was a little bland. The beans and rice were just fine. The salad was topped with beef, shredded Monterrey Jack cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream. 
 
I don&apos;t think I&apos;d order from them again. For the price, the food was just okay.","Tortilla soup heaven!! This place has the best food and the friendliest staff! Sad to see it so empty during covid, we love it and will continue to support them as much as we can!",Ordered six lengua tacos and costed $25. Pretty pricey huh? Not only that but the lengua was super dry. The tortilla was drier than the meat and kept falling apart. It was totally not edible. A waste of $25 that I could have invested in another restaurant.,"Still not so bueno. There really aren&apos;t many good options while walking around Greenlake, and for whatever reason, people default to Mexican -- since it&apos;s usually not bad. But, while on the last visit, the burrito &quot;passed&quot; and on my first visit my tacos were edible, on this visit my tortilla soup was terrible. It was so oversalted I had to add about a bowl&apos;s worth of pico to make it edible -- and I told the waitress when she asked. I&apos;ll admit I didn&apos;t say, &quot;Please give me something else.&quot; But, I did say, &quot;This is so incredibly salty I am having a hard time eating it.&quot; And, she said, &quot;Sorry.&quot; And, then walked away. So, eek! Bad food this visit, pretty weak food the last two times, and nice but insufficient customer service (but yes, I&apos;m signing up for a course in assertive clarity in just one moment...). 

Bottom line: Go to Greenlake to walk. Then leave.","This restaurant is really well located-you can go to it right off of Greenlake. The staff is really nice, and they have good serving sizes. I would give them 3/5 stars because their bathroom needs to be more accessible and secure (there was an issue with the lock). The food is okay-while they have good quality of food, they don&apos;t have the most unique options. The staff is what makes this place worth coming to, but they do need to make a few changes.","Came here for drinks with a friend - service was slow even though the place was not full. I ordered La Mula (&quot;mezcal&quot; mule) and my friend ordered a blended strawberry margarita. They got our drink orders, took them a while to get them for us, once they did come and leave the drinks I took a sip of my drink and saw there was a bug, waited for the waitress to come back... waited... waited more... finally had to stand up to flag her down after 20-30 mins. Told her her my drink had a big and she proceeded to question weather it has just fallen in there... when the drink was full and obviously had not taken more than a sip.. (trust me it would have been done in 30 mins). Brought me a second drink and it tasted like ginger beer.. no mezcal. I asked the waitress to make sure I had ordered the right one. And she responded with, I don&apos;t know what they put in drinks, I wouldn&apos;t be able to tell you. 

My friends drink also tasted like a strawberry juice. 

Should of left but tried a different drink, a mezcal margarita, same thing - no mezcal ‚Äç

When the bill came they didn&apos;t even have the courtesy of discounting the first drink that has a big in it. 

I&apos;m definitely not going there again.","I have always liked this place! Good food and food service and amazing amazing chips and salsa! 

Too bad they stopped taking Groupons for some legal reason the waiter said...just an FYI","This would be the few rare occasions that I run into mediocre Mexican food, I really didn&apos;t think you can go wrong with Mexican food, everything is suppose to taste decent if it&apos;s smothered in guacamole, salsa, or sour cream. Mexican food is the only food I think still taste delicious the next day as leftovers, heck I even think Taco Time is amazing. I think this place is has a selling point being right on Green Lake and is open late until 1:30am with their kitchen still serving food until midnight.  

The chips and salsa was about the best thing I tasted all night, all the rest of it food were really soggy with grease dripping everywhere making it impossible for me to hold anything to eat without my arm getting drown in oil. I was excited for my deep fried chicken taquitos that consistently taste great every where, the chicken tasted really off here. Overall, I should have save my money and went to the late night Taco Bell drive thru although it&apos;s not &quot;authentic&quot; Mexican food, at least they give me hot sauce with life quotes on it.

I still give this place a 3 star because service was nice and if this is your only option late at night living near here, then let it be. 

Tell me about your experience if you&apos;ve been here or is going to after reading this review:)","As a local whose lived in Greenlake my entire life, I&apos;ve been here countless times. I used to really like it but after this last experience, I will never support this business or any related business. 

I made a simple takeout order, an order I&apos;ve placed dozens of times, with intentions of using a coupon. The coupon specifically detailed it wasn&apos;t valid during happy hour or in combination with any other discounts- that&apos;s it, nothing about take out. They wouldn&apos;t accept the coupon, and wouldn&apos;t give an explanation. Frustrating but there was unfortunately more. 

Then, of course after paying, I realized an additional item that I did not order yet had been charged for. Still in the restaurant, I politely told the waitress that there had been a mistake, to which I was informed that in fact it was my fault. They refused correct the error. I have never heard of the dish I apparently ordered in my life. Not only was staff was extremely rude but they repeatedly blamed the customer. 

Luckily, Greenlake has many great options for dining, and there&apos;s no reason anyone should put up with this conduct. If you&apos;re looking for good Mexican food in Greenlake, Rositas is a great choice.","I haven&apos;t been to Tacos Guaymas for about two years. I&apos;m giving two stars as both the service and the food were sub-par. It took 15minutes for our waiter to take our drinks order. And then another 20 minutes to get our drinks. We both ordered fajitas and the plate with the beans, sour cream, guacamole etc were brought to the table first. The food was already barely warm. About 10 minutes later the meat finally arrived. And the food wasn&apos;t very good at all. 

The restaurant wasn&apos;t crowded so I&apos;m not sure why service was so slow.","Don&apos;t know why they have 3 stars... I&apos;m just here to
say... their Nachos Machos rules!","Very average Mexican food. I got the wet burrito w/ carne asada and it was decent. I wasn&apos;t a fan of the sauce they covered the burrito with.. it tasted like can enchilada sauce. My friends tried the flautas and fish tacos and they said it was okay. The meal did however come with complimentary chips and salsa

Basically if you are looking for cheaper Mexican food around Greenlake this does the trick.","Great tacos and customer service. Probably the better chorizo tacos I&apos;ve tasted in the area.  Open late on the weekends. 

Last night left a bag while eating. Called when I got home and they kept out for me to pick up the next day.","Ordered a pick up through Yelp and it was super timely, the food was fresh and really convenient. Thanks!","They are conveniently located next to Greenlake.  Love their outdoor seating area on nice days.  They also have large windows so even if you&apos;re sitting inside you can still enjoy the sunshine and activities going on outside.  I recommend the chimichanga! Large portions and definitely share-able.  They have complimentary chips and salsa when you sit down.  We went for brunch and had $5 mimosas.  The service is good, no complaints.  The food came out hot and the wait wasn&apos;t too long.  I definitely recommend if you&apos;re in the area and craving Mexican food.",I ordered 3 Super Burrito&apos;s and they were the driest worst burritos I have ever had. We could only taste the tomatoes in it and there was no steak flavor. They didn&apos;t include salsa. I have never ordered from a taqueria and not received salsa. I will never order from them again.,"When it&apos;s good, it&apos;s good! When it&apos;s bad, it&apos;s not worth the time or money. Last night was the latter. 

We were seated at just after 7 and didn&apos;t settle our bill until after 9, and we didn&apos;t linger because it had gotten uncomfortably chilly by 9. We requested several tables be pushed together to accommodate two families with kids. They did half the work and we ultimately had to add the last table. The first round of drinks took 20+ minutes - no joke - to come out and the Corona Light was delivered first on draft. Several minutes later the margaritas came out. Oddly, the next Corona Light was in a bottle. The place was 1/3 full of people. They clearly have staffing issues, as evidenced by the sign on the window looking for prep chefs and servers. Our friends at the next table told us to cancel our order and go elsewhere while we still could after reporting their food took over an hour, came out in waves, and had several mistakes. We were foolish enough not to heed their warning and suffered the same fate. We told our server we were going to cancel our order and she said it&apos;s already cooking. That was 50 minutes before it came out. This is Mexican food. Does it EVER take that long? 

Long story short, food was the same &quot;just okay&quot; quality, took forever to come out, and we were offered nothing more than a sorry from our kind server. 

Adios, Tacos Guaymas. Sad to say goodbye but totally done spending too much on another bad dining experience.","So I&apos;ve been back countless times since last review &amp; have neglected to update. 

Still a solid 3 stars. Layout &amp; small space of restaurant leaves something to be desired. Service pretty good. Not the best Mexican food in Seattle but will do in a pinch. 

Had the HH Taquitos on my last visit. Good tasting but not much chicken inside &amp; kinda dry. On my last visit I had the HH chicken taco salad &amp; it was excellent.","Favorite spot for food and drinks in Green Lake! 3 sections- quick to go, sit down, and bar. Bar has tv&apos;s for games. Always great music. Staff are lovely and food is delicious. Great drinks too. Highly recommend you check out our go-top spot","My husband LOVES their wet chicken verde burrito; it&apos;s healthier than most burritos, with lots of chicken, just the right amount of beans, rice and delicious sauce. I pick one up for him weekly! Their happy hour menu is the perfect size and price for tasting, and their bar/wait staff is very friendly, attentive and accommodating. Highly recommended. A must-do stop for meeting up with friends or taking food home to go after your Green Lake workout or adventure.","This place has fantastic food. I look forward to the end of &quot;Covid Season&quot; when we&apos;ll be able to dine in once again. Ordering for take out is working well, and as always the food is fresh and based on local ingredients. No regrets! Yummy!","I hardly ever eat fast food...like 5 times a year or less.
When I say fast food, I&apos;m only considering the major chains like McDonald&apos;s, B King, Taco Bell, Pop Eyes and yes, Taco Time.

We randomly stopped in here a week or so ago and were pleasantly surprised all around!

The staff was so friendly and helpful! I was so indecisive but they were kind and very patient.

We ordered to eat there and the food came out plated all nice. I didn&apos;t know that&apos;s how Taco Time rolled lol it was a nice touch. It felt less like a fast food chain.

The food was &quot;fresh fresh&quot; and we left satisfied all around. When we need that quick fix again, we&apos;ll be back!","This location is a safety hazard to all of Seattle.  Leaving the drive thru and trying to turn right is extremely dangerous.  The owners need to address this immediately.  I have been a loyal taco time customer since I was a little kid.  The lake city location has already lost my business for their lack of hygiene (I&apos;m talking filthy disgusting trash all over the floor environment).  Anyways, if I don&apos;t see no parking signs displayed along 45th within the next two weeks I will be filing a complaint with the city of Seattle.  And most importantly you will have lost my business. 

3/24/2020 update: looks like covid-19 took care of the parking situation.","I wish I went here more often. I like the food. I appreciate the quality.I see young, new staff from time to time.
I am always impressed re cleanliness and quickness to make food.
I am going to comment re parking and leaving from the drive-thru. It is a little hard to turn right as sometimes cars do block vision. It is impossible and completely reckless to try to turn left.
We live in Seattle and we have to think when we drive.","All of the Taco Bell Lovers out there don&apos;t know what they are missing! Apparently Taco Time is just a Washington thing. There aren&apos;t that many of them and now that I don&apos;t live in Washington I rarely get to eat there. But when I come back for a visit I look forward to my Crispy Beef Burrito! Yum! And Mexifries! Dipped in Hot Sauce! Oh man, now I&apos;m hungry again! Seriously though Taco Time is really good. I love that the burrito is actually crispy - fried yummy goodness! Next time you are in Washington State find a Taco Time and see what you&apos;ve been missing!","We found this place on our recent trip to Seattle. It reminds us of a fast food taco place here in Southern CA, only better. They have a lot of options and each item we tried was tasty. The refried bean crisp burrito and the crisp chicken taco lite were delicious. But, we really loved their Crustos. Fried tortilla with cinnamon and sugar. We couldn&apos;t eat them fast enough. 
It was convenient and we got our order quickly. Hit the spot while we were driving around sightseeing.","have you ever tried taking a left turn out of the drive-through???
Or taking a right turn out of the drive through? 
and can&apos;t see a god damn thing. almost killing yourself to go to this damn taco time","I wish Taco Time was less expensive. I&apos;ve never understood why their prices are so high for being fast food? But we still go here and love it! I get the natural tacos on the whole wheat tortilla and get the ranch sauce on the side or it&apos;s super saucy and messy! Natural beef, chicken, and natural veggie tacos are all super good! I&apos;ve also ordered the chicken fit bowl and that it super flavorful too and healthy! Always splurge on the mexi fries!!!!!! So worth it!!!","Well Taco Time, I&apos;ve tried to like you over the years but I just can&apos;t do it anymore.  Not when my #1 meal with beef comes to over $12 which involves a burrito that basically fits in the palm of my hand.  I finished it in 6 regular sized bites!  I left still feeling hungry and unsatisfied.  Other burrito joints in the area serve up a burrito that I can&apos;t even finish in 1 sitting, far superior at a cheaper price!  Until I hear it&apos;s changed, and you get what you pay for, I&apos;m done with you.  Either reduce the price or increase the portions, dramatically!","I get it, it&apos;s fast food. I&apos;m not expecting authentic Mexican nor am I even expecting Tex-Mex but I still have standards for this level of food.

The pros are that most of the ingredients were fresh for our visit. Also, the food seems a lot less processed than other fast food taco spots. Finally, I like the eco-friendly angle the franchise takes.

The cons are that the food was a mixed bag of flavorful and bland. Some of the items we ordered had bits of citrus, salt, and fat, what you expect of this cuisine. However, the overall experience felt as though we were eating at a place trying to save cost or cut calories by choosing the less tasty options.

We&apos;ve tried it once, maybe we&apos;ll try another location if we&apos;re in a pinch for time but I can&apos;t say that it&apos;ll be our first choice.","In a word: NASTY!  We started to come through the back door, which is the kitchen, and it is filthy.  The front door and windows were greasy and dirty.
We ordered a combo shrimp meal and a combo taco meal.  Could not eat the shrimp tacos as they were disgusting (measly quantity of cabbage and way overcooked shrimp - see photo).  Beef tacos had absolutely no flavor as they &quot;forgot to put the sauce on them&quot;.  The potato tots were cold, the soda was flat and the iced tea tasted like chemicals.  The only positive in the whole experience was the cashier who was friendly.  When we asked for a side order of chips, we were told it would be 69 cents for 8 chips.  They count the chips??? Since we couldn&apos;t eat the food there, we went to Kidd Valley and had fish and chips which were excellent!","Okay gonna keep it 3 star because I was happy with response from Taco Time management about my problem. Had they not replied I would have knocked them down to 2. 

So....  I very rarely go to Taco Time. I do like their food quite a bit as does hubby. But the value for food received always leaves me sad.  

This most recent visit I went through the drive thru to pick up a taco salad for myself and 2 tacos for hubby. One crunchy &amp; one Baja.  Taco salad great, crispy taco great but Baja taco practically inedible. The tortilla was completely broken apart.  No way to pick it up and eat it as a taco.  I don&apos;t know if it was an old tortilla or just poor tortilla choice to make a soft taco with. I contacted Taco Time and offered to send a pic of taco. They replied that they would send me a gift card for a free menu item to make up for bad taco.","Just left Taco Time&apos;s drive through. The guy who helped me was not wearing a mask. The food is always good there, but safety is very important right now. I will not be back.","I really wish I could like Taco Time.  It&apos;s local, always spotless inside, and the people are friendly.  But the food is just not good.  I&apos;ve had several things on the menu.  The crisp tacos and natural soft tacos are fine, if no better than ok.  But today I tried the crisp burrito because the counter guy suggested it would be like a chimichanga.  It&apos;s not. And it was bad; dry and flavorless.
I also had chips and salsa.  Chips were flavorless and needed salt; fine, I can add salt.  But the medium salsa was awful. Bland and sweet, like tomato sauce with some honey stirred in.  No garlic, no onion, no chiles, no flavor.  No thanks.
I can&apos;t do it.  I&apos;ve had my last meal at Taco Time.","Got a chicken soft taco and mexi fries. My order came out EXTREMELY quickly, v impressive. Food was tasty as always and the restaurant was sleepy in the afternoon but clean. Love the architecture of this unique taco time!",Probably 50% higher prices than other Taco Times in the city.  Also filthy throughout.  Food tasted fine and was quick.  People were fine too.,"Dining room was dirty, tables look like they had not been wiped all day, trash was full, bathrooms were disgusting and to top it all off the food was very poorly prepared. The beef was completely burnt and the tacos barely had any cheese on them. You would think during the middle of a state declared emergency for corona virus outbreak there would be more sanitation attempts. I don&apos;t have any experience in restaurant management and I&apos;m pretty certain I could do a better job.","I&apos;ve been to this Taco Time about once per week for the past 7 years.  In the Wallingford district of Seattle there are a great many place to eat but this is one of my favorites.  It&apos;s not cute little hipster place but it has everything I like.  It&apos;s clean, convenient, healthy, inexpensive, fast, and tasty.

The staff knows be by sight and they are always cheerful and even wave to me when I come in.  There&apos;s off-street parking available although it can be a little tricky getting out of their parking lot as you share the same exit with the drive-through.

I highly recommend this higher-quality fast food restaurant in Seattle.","When you&apos;re expecting Taco Bell, and you get Taco Time, it&apos;s just disappointing. I&apos;m going to compare it to Taco Bell because that&apos;s what I was expecting if the place is called Taco Time :)

This is in reference to the soft beef burrito I had: In comparison to TB, TT is significantly more expensive and doesn&apos;t taste as good (and by good, I mean cheap-cheesy-satisfying-late-night-Americanized-Mexican-food-good :) I also had the fish burrito, and that was decent and not something you could find at TB.

On the plus side, the portions are bigger, and the hot sauce is pretty good.

Objectively, it&apos;s not THAT bad, but it&apos;s in that strange in between state of not quite Taco Bell, and definitely not authentic Mexican.

I won&apos;t be frequenting TT, but if I had it for free, I wouldn&apos;t be complaining :)","I went on a pleasant spring evening and there were some loud teens sitting in the back of a pickup truck parked outside drinking sodas and telling loud stories which I bet where more appropriate for a private setting but besides that the futuristic architecture makes me feel like a science fiction movie and the crisp bean burrito was one of the best ones I&apos;ve had in 30 years of eating crisp bean burritos. there are some nice neon murals inside, but be warned: the jalapenos here were hotter than other locations.","A solid Mexican spot located right by Green Lake Park -- it was super easy to order online and I walked to the lakefront to eat my food. The staff was nice and the food was tasty too! They&apos;re doing indoor seating as well, but I just got takeout. They also have a ton of vegetarian options, which is great. 

I got the cheese enchiladas peqe√±os with verde salsa and it was the perfect amount of food -- the enchilada was super tasty and the rice was also fluffy and good. I really loved the chili verde flavor and the refried beans were also good with the chips they gave us!","Great takeout from Rosita&apos;s tonight!! Highly recommend. I was so impressed, not only with the food but the entire takeout experience. They were easy to order via phone, they have a takeout window setup now, and best of all the food was perfectly boxed up and in a sealed to go bag--never seen these before but it definitely keeps the food fresh! 
I loved their fajitas when we&apos;ve dined there in the past and I was craving them, I can honestly say they were very close to as good to go. Of course nothing beats fresh fajitas sizzling on a plate, but that&apos;s just not possible during COVID. Rosita&apos;s has done a phenomenal job! Good portion sizes too. We&apos;ll be back!","I love Rosita&apos;s! I&apos;ve been going here for the past three years and every time it is great. I ordered online through ChowNow (link to order is on Rosita&apos;s website) for pickup. The restaurant has a pickup window open so nobody enters the restaurant, which is awesome! My food was ready within 15 minutes of placing the order and it was packaged well and stayed warm in the new takeout bags (which are sealed closed to be ripped open at home). Really happy with the precautions being taken here, and glad that the restaurant is able to adapt so well. I&apos;ll definitely be ordering takeout here again in the near future!","I&apos;ve always wanted to try this restaurant out after walking around the lake. This restaurant is like any typical Mexican restaurant with higher than average prices. They have all the typical dishes at any Mexican restaurants and the decor is rather pretty nice. It&apos;s kind bigger than I thought too. 

I ordered a soup since I didn&apos;t want to fill all the way up and wanted some dessert next door. I ordered their sopa de frijoles and it has really good flavors. It didn&apos;t look super appetizing since it looked like it has just black soup. There are also rice, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro. I wish it had more rice since it felt it had a lot of black beans than other ingredients. The flavor was good though.","Really good hand made corn tortilla.
Good service and quality food.
Haven&apos;t tried any drinks but offers and has a good atmosphere for families to the singles.
Parking requires some patience but,
Would come back!",Love this Greenlake local and family-owned restaurant! The food is great and the staff and efficient and very nice. I especially like to order the chimichangas every time. It&apos;s a favorite.,Great Mexican food! I love ordering the enchiladas. The beans and rice are a perfect side. Their chips are my fav with the guacamole.,"I live supporting this local business. Rosita&apos;s has amazing food and their to go game is strong. Our dinner was ready within 20 minutes, super easy pick up process, and they seal the to go bag so the nachos were crisp and fresh.",I miss coming to Rosita. We haven&apos;t gone since the pandemic started but this place is great -- great food and great proportions. Feels very much like home cooking!,"Rositas is my go-to neighborhood restaurant when I&apos;m craving a good Mexican dish. They have a great vegetarian menu and the coconut margaritas are delicious! The happy hour menu has great options but only can be ordered in the bar so if you have kids or the bar is full you&apos;re out of luck. 

The fresh tortilla bar is such a great idea and fun for kids to get to watch the tortillas being made. Bring cash for tipping and you can eat endless amounts of tortillas while you wait for your food. The salsa is really tasty. 

Every time I come I order the veggie or shrimp fajitas to share because they are huge or the veggie chimichanga&apos;s! They are fried perfectly and topped with guacamole and tomato salsa. They are so good! 
If you order a kids item just remember rice and beans don&apos;t come with the quesadilla meal so order a side if yours is like mine and has to have it. 

I didn&apos;t give it 5 stars as much as I wanted to but instead gave it 4 because I have noticed every time I come here I don&apos;t have a great experience with the staff or don&apos;t feel welcomed. The staff can be very rude and stand offish like they hate being at work and anytime you ask for a refill or extra napkins they make you feel horrible and give you a eye roll but I still come back for the food haha! 

Parking is tricky as they have closed down the parking lot to build condos so you have to find street parking which you have to pay for.",Great Mexican in Green Lake! Super fun environment. The salsa is beyond amazing! Everything I&apos;ve had here is tasty and they serve large portions. Margs are delicious and decently priced! Can&apos;t wait to dine in here again!,"Hearty, comforting, and generous! We usually get the carne asada plate and the crispy tacos (sometimes chicken, sometimes beef), which they fry there rather than using store bought hard shells. Now that we have been getting takeout, they are still very generous, packing our order with the complimentary chips and salsa that would usually just be brought to the table for dine-in orders. Moreover, their service is always friendly. While it isn&apos;t the least expensive place, it is reasonably priced, especially for the Green Lake area and for how much food you get!","We came here around 6pm tonight and the main dining area was really loud. I&apos;m not sure if they always have that many kids there but it seemed like there were a lot of kids running around. My water came in a glass that had a full on bright pink lipstick print on it and I knew it wasn&apos;t me since I wasn&apos;t wearing lipstick. Gross! 

I ordered the taco dish and thought that the meat wasn&apos;t that flavorful, rice also had a weird flavorful. I&apos;m also used to taco dishes having three small tacos but this one had one crispy taco. I ended up eating my husband&apos;s carnitas which was slightly better. 

The one good thing was the freshly made tortillas they have in the evenings.","Best enchiladas I&apos;ve had in Seattle! I usually get the enchiladas rancheras with guacamole. Yum!

It&apos;s hard to find good Mexican food here, and I&apos;m quite picky since I grew up eating lots of Mexican home cooking, so I really appreciate this restaurant. They make their own corn tortillas and chips, and you can tell the salsa/sauces are fresh. Staff is also very friendly and helpful!","While the Seattle area is definitely lacking in good Mexican food, this is hands down my favorite spot I&apos;ve found yet. From the fresh handmade tortilla station while you wait, to the green salsa, and of course delicious food makes Rosita&apos;s well worth the drive to Green Lake. Not to mention their HH menu is a steal--you&apos;re losing money not going there for happy hour! The staff is always super nice and they keep the baskets of warm chips flowing nonstop. The only thing that could make Rosita&apos;s even better than the wonderful gem it is would be a spicer salsa or hot sauce! Regardless will keep coming back for more sans extra spice!","Rosita&apos;s is perfect-so close to Green Lake and they serve excellent food and drinks. They have a tortilla station and the BEST salsa in the area. They are clean, elegant and the staff is so nice. This is a great spot to throw a party or come yourself. A margarita + chorizo burrito here = happy camper.","Great for &quot;melted cheese on a hot plate&quot; style Mexican food, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for.","The best Mexican food that I&apos;ve had in Seattle!  Seriously so good!  My husband and I ordered the vegetarian chimichanga and nachos.  The chimichanga was the best I&apos;ve ever had!  Loved the layers of beans and cheese within the crispy chimichanga shell.  The salsa, guacamole, and white sauce topping the chimichanga were incredibly good.  Added to the small nachos we ordered, we had more than enough food given the super generous portion sizes.  Prior to trying Rosita&apos;s, we were bemoaning the dearth of good Mexican restaurants in Seattle.  We hit the culinary jackpot with this awesome find!",The best corn tortillas I have ever had in my 35 years of living. The owner Sergio walks around and embraces all of the customers. This is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant!,"I always come for happy hour! The margaritas are refreshing and delightful. The free chips and salsa are endless and addictive. The food comes out fresh, piping hot, generously portioned, and absolutely delicious!","Such a great spot for legit Mexican food. I go here for the burritos and my partner is obsessed with the mango tacos. The portions are big, the tamales are great, and the service was fast. When they were were open for dine in, I had a most excellent michelada. 
They&apos;re in a bit of an odd spot, but the food is worth it. 

Also if you&apos;re veg, cactus is an option, which is tasty.","This was was a delightful Mexican feast. I had the verde enchiladas with carnitas and a margarita to go  wonderful flavor, super filling. Exactly what I was hoping for, just good quality comfort. Only gripe would be to add more sauce for an even wetter experience. 

It was all packed great for takeout as well, with lots of spicy little salsas. I&apos;ll be back as soon as I can make the trip!","This is probably our favorite Mexican restaurant in Seattle. On the account that we both had to work into the evening, my wife and I opted for delivery.  As things go in the Covid-era, we get delivery once or twice per week. 
Well, when we started in on the food this evening my wife quickly exclaimed, &quot;this is the best food we have had in a long time!&quot;  After confirming that she meant best takeout (I consider myself a decent purveyor of home cooked meals) I rapidly agreed. Each dish was carefully prepared and the portions were generous.  I meant to order a little extra so I would have some for lunch tomorrow.  It looks like we will have leftovers for a few days now.","Being fairly new to Seattle, I&apos;ve been on the hunt to find awesome Mexican food, and think I&apos;ve found it here! We came on a weekday night, and they were fairly busy! The location is right on a busy street, but there&apos;s ton of street parking behind the building. When we walked in, we ordered right at the country and got seated quickly. The food did take way longer than we anticipated, but when it came out, the wait was so worth it!

We ordered the 5 tacos for $8.00 deal, and chicken enchiladas. The enchiladas were stuffed tight with moist and flavorful pulled chicken, and the tacos were also topped with tons of meats, onions, and cilantro. The flavors of everything were so good, and the salsas made everything even better! I definitely want to come back and try more of their menu items as well as the many drinks they offer. The only thing that docked a star for me, was the attention of the staff - it wasn&apos;t too busy, but we sat for an extra 10-15 minutes actively trying to flag someone down to ask for our check as they kept walking right past us. At one point, we had asked for it, but they never came back. Aside from that, their food is amazing and the restaurant is a cool hole in the wall to stop in at!",Love! They followed the special instructions and sent so much food we will have left overs for sure. The food was delicious and warm when it arrived! Definitely would recommend to friends.,I was delivering something to my close friend along Seattle area. And i use Yelp app to search closest Tacos Mexican Food!    Very good this one. Will sure bring my husband there next time! :),Very good food and great service. Been looking for a real Mexican Food spot for a while here in Seattle. Glad I finally found it.,"¬øCocina de abuelita? 
¬°Claro que s√≠!

I didn&apos;t have a Mexican granny (mine was Cuban) but I can appreciate the rich flavors and unctuous textures that result from long slow cooking and attention to detail. 

Legendario offers up many delicious dishes that are like little else in Seattle. See the pictures, scan the menus, but go for yourself. The food deserves 5 stars and more. 

¬°Qu√© rico!  We started with chips and salsa and got a side of guacamole while we waited for the cactus salad to show up. 

The ensalada de nopales was big on flavor and small on price. The mole was a standout.

Huaraches were delicious: oval-shaped thick tortillas piled up high with refried beans, meat, taco veggies, sour cream, and queso fresco. 

Quesadilla was my favorite. Its huge interior filled with perfectly tender prawns and herbed cheesy goodness really hit the spot. 

Love Mexican? 
To Legendario you must go.  

But go during daylight hours, if possible, and be safe. 

The restaurant sits on an otherwise unnoticed stretch of Aurora Avenue that comprises four blocks between the Aurora Avenue Bridge and the boundary of Woodland Park. 

Since there&apos;s nothing of note nearby, this little slice of North Seattle offers up its own special
kind of sketchiness, but don&apos;t be afraid. Just be aware of your surroundings, take a friend along (or two) and you&apos;ll be fine. 

I want to go back for Menudo and Carnitas.","I think this is the best Mexican restaurant in the Seattle area. Authentic food, good drinks, and a solid atmosphere.","Totally get the lamb birra, tamarind Margarita and carne asada fries. We have been coming here for years and they never disappoint.","I&apos;ve been here a dozen times and have decided it&apos;s one of the best Mexican places in Seattle. Notably, I think they&apos;ve upped their game during the pandemic. The Taco Tuesday deal might be the best value in town and their chips and salsa are perfect. I&apos;m particularly fond of their pozole which tastes like nana made it. Not just a neighborhood classic, it&apos;s a legit destination.","The food was ok. I had a burrito. The shredded chicken was a little tough. Other than that everything else was good. Chips were fresh and the guac is homemade.
Drinks were reasonable and good. Good service","I am visiting from CA, and was craving menudo due to the cold weather here. I found this hole in the wall on Yelp and hands down this is thee best Mexican food I have ever had.  Their menudo was hot, delicious, and hearty.  It&apos;s hard to find a place that uses the honeycomb part of the stomach and they do. Also, the sopes with carne asada was good too. I would recommend ordering anything with their asada meat. Lastly, the service was quick and prompt. I will definitely come back when I&apos;m in town again.","I&apos;m so happy this place has started delivering via Uber eats! I used to live nearby and have missed them. This is really good authentic Mexican food and they have a pretty extensive menu! I&apos;ve had their tacos, carne asada, burritos, pozole, and barbacoa and all have been very good and super authentic. Also, all of their orders have arrived very well packaged and included all the sides I would find dining in which has become important to me during these COVID home dining times.","This place is legit. Excellent, authentic Mexican food served up by lovely friendly people. You  can&apos;t go wrong with anything on their menu. It doesn&apos;t look like much on the outside, but don&apos;t be fooled: the treasure is within.

I encounter many reviews for mexican restaurants written by people who think places like Chilis or Las Margaritas are their yardstick for good - you know, the places where beans come covered in oily melted orange cheese. My experience with mexican food comes from thirty years in Tucson Arizona, where excellent, authentic mexican food is a way of daily life; Tucson is noted for the best mexican food anywhere, and it was awarded a UNESCO world heritage site for food innovation. I know of what I speak. Get thee to El Legendario!","Best street tacos I&apos;ve had for the right price, have a great deal on tuesdays for 5 tacos and two beers for $12! Have recommended to all my friends and will definitely be going back!","They are great for Uber eats or pick up; everything was very well packaged. Good portion size, more importantly everything was super tasty.","This is THE spot. They knew my order by memory before COVID (what can I say - I like what I like, haha). Seriously, since moving from Texas I struggled to find a tasty Mexican food place. 10 of 10 for this family owned restaurant. Please support them!!","Updating last review since I accidentally wrote carne asada but meant carnitas. I often order the nachos with carnitas. I LOVE them. Huge serving--lots of fixings. I&apos;ve also had their soup, plates, burritos, fish tacos, etc. I&apos;m from San Diego and I&apos;m so happy this place exists in Seattle. I like their pico de gallo and their chipotle red sauce.","So much deliciousness!  We are here at least once a week, I swear.  They&apos;ve got their take-out situation DOWN!  Awesome margaritas to-go even!  Check out their menu on-line, ring them up, and swing on by in 15-20.  The pick-up station is right as you get in the door and you can see thru the glass door if you need to wait until someone else finished getting their goodies.  Support this lovely, family-owned, local business in these nutty times, y&apos;all!!!!!",There was a semi long line but the workers went fast! They were super nice and seemed on top of keeping the line moving. There were a lot of items in low stock but they seemed to be working on restocking quickly! Great workers and quality Chipotle.,"This location is an absolute joke. One person working the front on a Friday night?

Ordered for pickup at 8:15pm. Waited in the restaurant for 30 minutes because my order wasn&apos;t ready. They were so backed up on orders that they didn&apos;t start making my burrito until 8:38pm.","This Chipotle gets a lot of foot traffic because of its convenient location for college students. While I find the food here passable, I think that the quantity and quality are better at the Chipotle located in University Village.

My main complaint about this location is that the guacamole and fajita veggies didn&apos;t look super fresh; they looked like they&apos;ve been sitting out for a while due to their dull color.

Also, while I admit I ordered takeout, the food was below lukewarm by the time I walked 15-minutes back to my apartment. I&apos;m not sure if the food was hot to begin with, but they do have a good or excellent health rating, so I assume that they are adhering to food safety temperature regulations.

My usual go-to order is a chicken bowl with brown rice, black beans, fajita veggies, lettuce, sour cream, corn salsa, mild salsa, hot salsa, and if I feel like splurging the extra $2.25, guacamole. The chicken tasted moist on my latest visit, but I have gotten dry chicken from them before. Just make sure to look at the meat before making your selection.

Service was quick and I was in and out of the door withIn 15 minutes.

Obviously, Chipotle is not my first pick on The Ave for food, but it&apos;s good enough for the busy college student.

Overall: 3/5 for food, 4/5 for service","Fast, clean, and the price was very reasonable for college students. I ordered chicken bowl and overall it was great. I especially love their salsa and sour cream. They always make the food even tastier. The staff was friendly too!",I  was having a rough week when I finally decided to try Chipotle for the first time. I went in for lunch and told the worker that it was my first time and she very kindly explained to me how to order. She even went out of her way and paid for my meal since it was my first time! This simple act of kindness really turned my horrible mood around and meant alot to me! I&apos;m really glad I came here today and am really grateful!,"Worst service I&apos;ve received even before the pandemic had started. I have gone in now multiple times where I have been ignored by staff as I was waiting to be helped and had to walk out. Today in particular they decided to leave us with a snarky and rude comment as we were on the way out. Also, after watching a cook &quot;sanatize&quot; knives in a dirty sanny bucket I would be thoughtful of eating here next time.","Awesome. 1 hour before you&apos;re suppose to close, I come in ready to spend $20+ but I get the half quality service. No corn salsa and no mild salsa. Meat been sitting there for the past hour. Guacamole browner than my skin. Glad I made the trip here.  $13 for meat and cheese. Very sorry I didn&apos;t go to my local Mexican place instead of this crap.  Manager closing down everything an hour early. Thanks. Never going here again. You give quick service a bad name.",The line was pretty long when I walked in but they were so quick and fast. My food tastes delicious and the workers were very nice and speedy. Thank you!,Chipotle is a great place to eat because of how easy it is to customize your meal. I always get a bowl and sometimes a tortilla on the side which doesn&apos;t cost extra. You can also add more lettuce which sometimes they don&apos;t out a lot so you can ask for more which is great. Their tortilla chips are also so addictive to eat with the guac. The bowl is a good price and it&apos;s enough for two people. It&apos;s a good fast food place to eat healthy as well.,To start off the woman who served me my food was INCREDIBLY rude. I have a service animal that I bring with me everywhere and she asked me if he was a service dog to which I replied yes to. She then asked me for proof of service (I.e. his papers) which is NOT LEGAL. She then tried to argue with me when I told her it was not legal and said that they had a huge health inspection coming up and it was going to be my dogs fault if they did not pass. She even went as far as to get a manager and make a scene. Chipotle you need to educate your workers on ACTUAL ADA laws rather than whatever is off the top of their heads.,"You&apos;ll do much better at qdoba 

Don&apos;t try their fajita veggies if you have to go here. Never enough stocked for a full bowl. Lowest quality food on the block","There were no workers in the front of the store when we came in, no customers either. The man (maybe manager) saw us and said one minute and went to the back and stayed there. This was about 2p on a Saturday! 
    We waited for a couple more minutes and about to leave. Then a worker came out. 
    Erin (name tag) / Amy (name on receipt) who prepared our food was rude throughout our visit. I got a veggie burrito and my partner got a chicken burrito and a small chip/guacamole.  I asked Erin/Amy if there was fresh peppers/onions since the ones remaining were dried and overcooked (old), she sighed and said I&apos;ll look. She took the uncovered and &quot;fresh&quot; peppers container  that was  sitting on back prep table and then added the old pepper mix to it. I asked her why she that since I asked for new fresh - I got an eye roll. I passed on the pepper/onion mix. She started making my partner&apos;s burrito. Then a person for pick up order came and asked for lids. Erin/Amy stopped making the chicken burrito and helped the guy. She returned to making our 2nd burrito without washing hands or changing gloves!!!  WOW - FOOD HANDLING 101!!!!  
   The other other burrito was completed  and we paid. 

   Got home and started eating. The rice has crunchy bits and tastes slightly burnt. The tomatoes in the  salsa (mild pico) are more yellow than orange/red and the shredded lettuce pieces have many brown spots. 

    Gross. Gross. Gross.  Never coming to this location again! I typically like Chipotle too! 
    I wonder how they got an &quot;Excellent&quot; Health Department score!","Ordered Sofritos bowl for delivery through the app, received a Chicken bowl. As a vegetarian this was not an option to eat for lunch. In an effort to get the correct food delivered I called this store directly and spoke with someone quite rude who had zero desire to make this right and dumped me off on an 800 number. Called the number and was told they don&apos;t handle complaints there and i need to send a message through their website. After wasting 30 minutes of my lunch with this runaround i finally got the complaint in through the website and was told they could send me a coupon in the mail. What an absolute joke! Now i get to be hungry for the rest of the day and maybe in a week or two the mailman will bring me a coupon. Not even slightly impressed.","$8.00 for a Less Bowl Rice, Steak and Beans. Then gave me a big scoop of Guacamole for $2.10 and as sprinkle of Queso for. $1.30. Mostly i ate Guacamole didn&apos;t taste the Rice and Steak. Worst Deal for $12.55.
I should have 2 Big Burger already across the Street...

#NotAWorthForYourMoney",I literally had to wait an hour for my food to get delivered. I should&apos;ve just walked in the rain and got food. My first time ordering from them via doordash. AND my order is wrong! No lettuce! The tortilla was chewy as hell gave it to my dog. Some of the brown rice is undercooked. Lameness!,"This Chipotle leaves out the honey chipotle dressing from my salad orders every. Single. Time. Whether I order to go, or Uber eats, or in house. Every time it&apos;s forgotten.","If I could give 0 stars I would. We usually love chipotle, and used to come here all the time, but after getting chicken in the queso of our Vegetarian burrito (my partner is extremely allergic to meat) to completely ignoring mobile orders for up to 20 minutes after pickup time (we ordered 20 minutes beforehand btw) and getting absolutely no response after sending an email about the multiple issues, we&apos;re done. This place is a damn mess, y&apos;all need to step your p*ssy up or replace your whole staff. Disgusting and disappointing.","Chipotle I love you, you will forever bless me with the most dreamy tortilla chips I have ever seen. Thank you. Your chips will forever have a small slice of my heart 

Forever and always,
Pria 
(Your #1 chip fan minus hannah (she is kinda up there too)","It&apos;s a 3.

To be fair, I knew what I was getting into.  Fast (Mexican) food.  Taco bell,  Taco Time, and whatever chain you want to mention.

This is the first time I&apos;ve tried it.  There&apos;s one in Vancouver, but I never did haul my sorry ass over there to try it.  I came here instead.

And..... it&apos;s ok.  Stainless steel tables, assembly line food prep.  I dunno what&apos;s considered &quot;authentic&quot;  but I know what I like and don&apos;t like.  This was ok.  I&apos;ve def had better.  I hear that DTF in Bellevue has Mexicans wrapping the XLB&apos;s.  I&apos;m Asian myself. Does that instantly disqualify them as &quot;inauthentic&quot;.  I dunno, you tell me.

3 stars.",Just waited in a super long line just for chips and guacamole. No announcements made to the large line. No sign. They are out of guacamole. That&apos;s something they need to share. As a vegetarian that&apos;s a key piece of the burrito bowl. I wouldn&apos;t be writing a review but the white dude at the register was rude (Sunday 6/23 at 7 PM) about it and non apologetic. Bad service. Never going back to this location.,"The outdoor patio is covered and heated! They also have a tv setup outside for the games. 

Service is great, the food has definitely taken a turn for the better. Everyone in our dinner party )including 3 picky children) ate everything on our plates and enjoyed it! 

Come for the food, stay for the ambiance and view!",Best guacamole in town! Very friendly and great margaritas as well. I also always feel safe there as they keep everything clean and social distanced.,This is a great place to get food and drinks with a view! Stopped by yesterday with a couple of friends and were able to get great outdoor seating which overlooks east lake. The margaritas were refreshing on top of having great food. I ordered the taquitos borrachos which was flavorful and fresh. Would recommend checking it out before the sun disappears for a while here in Seattle!,"Let me preface this review by saying, oftentimes, I love this place- albeit the high prices and not-so-authentic Mexican food. This evening was the worst experience I&apos;ve had at Little Water in my time going there. We ordered a round of drinks and simple appetizers (chips and salsa, guacamole, and queso). Drinks were made ASAP, and we were told the food would be out soon. 

20 minutes later, the salsa and queso were delivered to our table. Totally cool. We asked when the guac would be coming (an order of guac is $10 FYI) and the manager said soon- kitchen is really backed up. So we wait and wait. I finally return to the bar to ask where our guac is. The bartender says he can&apos;t help us with our problem so calls over the manager.. the manager was super rude. I told him we don&apos;t even want the guac anymore, but some beers would be great. He responds saying he cannot give us more alcohol? But he&apos;ll give us a gift card in the refund amount for the guac. I asked for a credit card refund, which he gave. He proceeded to come to our table afterwards to let us know he&apos;d &quot;happily fire the kitchen&quot; if that&apos;s what we wanted.

No, we would never want you to fire the kitchen. All we would simply want is some communication about something as simple as guac, and maybe some sympathy for us waiting for 1+ hour for avocado smashed into a guac. Maybe a free drink or complimentary gift card would have made things better,  but Little Cantina&apos;s manager was too hard set on his &quot;image&quot; than making things right with a customer.","Absolutely horrifying service. I went to order and realized I had forgotten my ID. The waitress refused to take my order at all, even without alcohol. The manager stood there and didn&apos;t say a word. 
If you don&apos;t drink here I guess you&apos;re not worthy of service.","Bartender is a little bit abrasive. Food is good but overpriced. I&apos;d probably go back if they lowered their price point or if I knew there was a different bartender. That said, there are plenty of other options to choose from in the area.","Great food and drink, horrifying service. Went for my friends birthday and when you walk in you aren&apos;t even greeted. We didn&apos;t know what their COVID procedures were and it would&apos;ve been nice to know upon entrance. We proceeded to order food and drink at the bar- bartenders/food runners were not enthusiastic or friendly at all. I understand with COVID it can be really stressful (I work a customer facing job 9-6 everyday so I get it) however the least you can do is ask how we are doing and have a smile on your face- Especially when we are ordering round after round, entrees, and tipping very generously. Our waiter even tried to argue with my friend when she kindly said &quot;this isn&apos;t what I ordered.. I wanted this&quot; Kudos to the chefs working in the back. All of our entrees were amazing it was a bummer the folks running your food were so sour.","This was exactly, EXACTLY, what I was looking for today: outside, gorgeous view, delicious margarita, perfect chips, salsa and guac, yummy quesadilla. All spot-on and I can&apos;t wait to go back!","I hate to leave a bad review somewhere but I needed to get this out since it actually put my health at risk. Ordering online from them shows their chip option defaults as corn but in reality it is flour, as someone with a gluten allergy this is super disappointing and important. When I called they said they had to control over it and couldn&apos;t take responsibility. But I advised they should at least straighten out any glitch they have with post mates to let people know since it could cause someone (like me) to get really sick. Even just a label on the bag the chips comes in would have been helpful so I didn&apos;t eat them. It&apos;s pretty simple. 
This was also after they didn&apos;t even have the item I ordered on the menu anymore. (Even more disappointing).
The food is usually amazing but tonight it actually lacked flavor. 
Will not be ordering or dining in here again.","Drinks are FUERTE (that means strong in spanish lawl) so be careful! One or two, but three? wowza. The patio is also muy bonita (very pretty!). Food okay. The special corn that was like they sell on the streets of Ciudad de Mexico (Mexico City!) was very good though.",The shrimp burrito is the best I&apos;ve ever had!! Also love their fluffy chips &amp; guac. The spicy marg was OK.,"The best thing about Little Water Cantina on Eastlake Ave. is its location on Lake Union. On a summer evening, it&apos;s pleasant to sit on their large deck and sip a margarita. The service, by earnest young waiters and waitresses, is generally good.
The food, however, is surprisingly... meh. The menu is limited, which would normally give a restaurant a great many opportunities to perfect what they offer. But here, most items-- and our large group tried most-- are noteworthy. The chimichanga relleno, which is a chile relleno covered with a deep fried dough, is heavy and not very flavorful. Only the mole sauce had any character. The tacos are average, with nothing memorable about them. 
They clearly make most of their money from the tequila cocktails, with a long list of margaritas. The house margarita was only so-so, and the paloma was not good. Sorry to be so honest.","Sad. This used to be a gem. It&apos;s very much an average, whitewashed Mexican place. The view and the patio are the only saving Grace.","I honestly don&apos;t know why this place has only 3 stars... I sure enjoyed the drinks, food, and view!

I came for dinner in September when the weather was still gorgeous and warm, so I was able to sit outside and take in the view of South Lake Union. The outside patio was fairly full around 6 on a Sunday... inside wasn&apos;t as popular, obviously. We have to soak up what little sunshine we get here!

For drinks I went with the Paloma, well I ended up getting two since it was refreshing and why not? The Paloma includes Mi Campo blanco tequila, fresh grapefruit and fresh lime juices, simple syrup, and soda ($11). It&apos;s served on the rocks in a highball glass. I&apos;ve had better but it was still quite good! 

On to the food! The Guacamole + Chips and Salsa are bomb. The chips especially! I don&apos;t know what they do to those things but they&apos;re tastyyy. The guac is made of &quot;Mexican avocados&quot; (versus?) smashed up with roasted tomatillo salsa and topped with pico de gallo ($10). It&apos;s served with fluffy flour tortilla strips. Dang those things are good. The salsa is composed of charred tomatoes, tomatillos, onions, and chilies then topped with fresh cilantro ($5). It&apos;s served alongside crispy, freshly fried corn chips. I honestly would have been happy with the Palomas and dips + chips alone but I had to try the Fish Tacos as well hehe. The Pescado Tacos plate comes with two tacos filled with generous pieces of spice rubbed wild Alaskan cod with mango salsa, avocado crema, cabbage slaw, and cilantro ($16). The fish is also available beer-battered and fried, Baja-style... we specified the non-fried option but they served us the fried fish which was still fresh, tasty and flavorful! I didn&apos;t even notice until after the fact, so it wasn&apos;t an issue. Red rice and cantina beans are served with the tacos as well. One taco with some rice and beans, plus the chips and dips along with the drinks was plenty for dinner. Yum!

Service was decent, so no complaints there. 

I&apos;d come back again in the summer to order the exact same thing, it was that good.","The view from this place is amazing. It is near waterfront and you can find seating inside or outdoors. The food was really good. The waiter customized the dish for me because I am vegetarian. It has kind of a Hawaii feeling to it.

The quesadilla needed more cheese and be crunchy. The tacos were served with a side of beans and rice. The tacos had fried onion with cheese and green peppers but it did not have any other flavor and was bland otherwise. They did give a spicy Mexican dip on the side but I do not like my food spicy. We had ordered chips on the side and they were salty and good.

The waitress was very patient and let us take our time to select the appetizers and main course. There was no wait time to be seated or getting our food. If we wanted to be seated outside then you shared your bench with another group and there was a wait time for that.

I think the food needs improvement but the service and location is great.","Got on list (for an hr.) and then got seated. We didn&apos;t get sat by anyone that worked there, we got sat by the &quot;DJ&quot; playing music that evening which was random but nice by him. Sat there for 15 min and went to bar to ask about ordering food. Was told, &quot;oh yea, you have to order here.&quot;  JOKE!!! No instructions, there didn&apos;t seem to be any process, no NOTHING... we go out all the time; this was a joke...","Love this place , right by the water with an amazing view .. all staff are friendly and customer service are amazing","Will not recommend this place if you are a person of color. My family and I came for some drinks/dinner and a good time, but clearly that was not achieved. Our experience was ruined by their awful customer service. The checkin girl at the bar, with blonde hair, was very prejudice towards us along with a terrible attitude. We then got escorted to seat at a wooden table that was soaking wet. I felt so disrespected that we left as soon as we sat down. Why would you escort customers to a table that is obviously not ready to be used? I will stress this again, the check in girl at the bar was very prejudice. This kind of service is repulsive and rude. The funny thing is that this place is a &quot;Mexican&quot; restaurant -- but gave the only Mexicans/people of color at this establishment, terrible service. Again will not recommend this place to POCS.","My boyfriend and we&apos;re so excited to go here to celebrate my promotion. We picked this place over Westward (I&apos;d recommend going here) but of course we chose the wrong restaurant. Although Our bartender was nice, we were told we&apos;d have a 30-40 minute wait. This was totally okay for us! Little did we know, it&apos;d be an hour - 90 minute wait and we got terrible service. Besides our bartender, we were granted with little to no respect for our service and got seated at a table that WAS ALREADY TAKEN! They were in the bathroom. Overall, a horrible experience and I would not go back. I&apos;m in disbelief at the understaffing they have at this restaurant.","I&apos;ve been here a few times and so far I love it! On the pricey end, especially if you order lots of margaritas although the bartender was super good and took good care of us. Great food and awesome views! A couple weird COVID interactions with service but I&apos;m not holding that against them. I&apos;ll be back for sure!","I don&apos;t know how y&apos;all feel about the Lord and just having your back all the time right on time

Started off with that to say this. the other morning I found myself waking thinking about my injury and what I&apos;ve gone through in 143 days. Well I guess by then it would have been 142 days seeing that this happened yesterday. Anyhow I found myself asking a question when I woke..&quot;do black lives really matter like all these people make it out to be?&quot; 

&quot;Does my black life matter to anybody??.. more in particular matter to a stranger?&quot;

So yesterday a girlfriend and I decided to challenge ourselves and walk across the bridge for the first time.  it was a beautiful walk. we walked from U district all the way to Eastlake and found ourselves at Pecado Buenos. 

I asked the very nice cashier if he didn&apos;t mind if I use the restroom .  we decided to grab some food because they did have a vegan option and that was good in my book because my girlfriend is vegan!! 

So cutting to the chase when I was in the restroom he decided to ask my homegirl my story behind my eye patch. He asked if I had some kind of procedure or would not and that&apos;s when she informed him that I was hurt in my first peaceful protest. right then and there he must have felt some kind of way because he told my friend that he was going to surprise and by my lunch for me.

I come out the bathroom and I order our two things. He says a total of 13 something. I looked at him and I said that&apos;s not correct I purchased two things. He said I know I want to pick up your lunch for you. I asked about you and you went in the bathroom and your friend told me. I was so shocked surprised and grateful.

The moral of the story is.. Patrick is fucking amazing and thank you Jesus for showing me in a quick turnaround time... A black life really DOES  matter to some of us","Pecado Bueno is the #1 spot for a true San Diego burrito! Being from SoCal I&apos;ve searched high and low for a delicious burrito in seattle. Look no further! Highly recommend their roja and habanero salsa which is included with the chips. Burritos are filling, delicious, and oh the tater tots in the middle are divine. Support this awesome place and covered heated patio in the back is a great way to enjoy your meal outside but not in the rain!
Ps - their margs are delicious and extra strong","Always love this place, and tonight did not disappoint! We treated ourselves to their warm and ready right on time take out! The wet burrito was delicious as well as the Caesar salad with my fav, their carne asada and extra guacamole! Love having this Mexican gem in Eastlake, food is always perfect and the staff super warm and welcoming","The outdoor patio is SWEET. Vibe is great, and the fires are awesome. GOOD FOR A GROUP OF 4-8. Great spot to grab a couple beers and a quick bite, too. Service is also really good and fast! 

The downside is that the food is just okay. The enchiladas with ranchero sauce are my go-to and they are usually about 4/5. Recently had the shrimp tacos and give them a 3/5. At best. Chips and salsa combos are good but not great. Guacamole is fine, but not great. All in all, the vibe is what would make you wanna come and stay for a couple drinks. Verdict: 3/5.",I love coming to this place for lunch! They&apos;re always so nice and are welcoming to questions about the menu or  modifications you might want. FYI! The quesadilla is amazing!,"We&apos;ve lived in north cap hill (10 min walk away) for the last 6 months and have been trying all the Eastlake restaurants. Liked the vibe of this place! Has a beach shack feel and reminded me of a cross between Taco Del Mar and BW3s. There is a ton of seating both inside and out and a couple large TVs.

Strong house marg ($5 on hh) and great tasting happy hour salads and chicken nachos!! Added ceviche to my Caesar and it was fresh and tasty. One of the best caesars I&apos;ve had! Total after tip was only about $40 (including drinks) and was a good amount of food!

Will definitely come back for happy hour with some friends.",We love this place! Some of the best Mexican food we have had in awhile. Generous portions and very fresh tasting. We got the breakfast burrito and the shrimp burrito bowl. Both were excellent.,"I don&apos;t care what anybody has to say - I LOVE this place. My brother and I came here once and the man at the front was SUPER nice and sweet. He was patient since we were for timers and he was so kind in talking to us about the menu and giving recommendations. He was so chill. 

The food is also so great. The vibe too. 

I get the tacos and it&apos;s to DIE for. I&apos;m coming back on Friday and I&apos;m already so excited !!!","A great local neighborhood joint. Seriously the staff is always so friendly here. The food comes out fast and is great. I love their chicken tacos! They usually have a sporting event on tv and happy hour daily. I love Pecado Bueno and will continue to support them. They&apos;re so good and just great people. Also, this location has parking which is always a plus.",I&apos;ll keep this simple. Hands-down the worst Mexican food I&apos;ve ever had.  nothing good about this place.  microwaved mexican tops this every day of the week.,"This is my favorite restaurant in Eastlake... it may even be my favorite spot in Seattle! The food is served quickly, drinks are mixed exactly the way you want them, and entre√© prices are reasonable. Order the tacos or the enchiladas, with all three sauces!",Love this place.   Always so good... I usually get a few sides to make a meal.   The baja salad is one of my favorites.  I love the breakfast burrito.  Now I&apos;m starving!,Can&apos;t speak to anything other than the nachos but yes please!! I came not super hungry so got a beer and shared some nachos with my friend and the nachos were actually perfect. They had huge tvs playing football so a great spot to come and watch a game if that&apos;s what you&apos;re looking for!,"I was in the Eastlake area for a meeting and wanted to get some lunch so I decided to give this place a try since it was just down the street. You also can&apos;t really go wrong with Mexican food.

However, this place was just disappointing. It is self service so you bust your own table and get your own drinks which I don&apos;t mind. The food on the other hand I did not like. I ordered a burrito which I always give a try, but this one was very bland. I got chicken which tasted like it wasn&apos;t seasoned at all and the rice had lots of hard dry grains. There were only like five small pieces of chopped tomato and onions. Chips were practically stale and I didn&apos;t even bother getting any salsa because I was just over the food at that point and felt that nothing could save it. 

My advice: try to avoid this place if you can. There are other Mexican restaurants nearby that are most likely better.","Yeah... it serves Mexican inspired food but it tastes like they are using the cheapest possible ingredients... or, I suppose, more accurately, it tastes like some white soccer mom was told it&apos;s her turn to for Taco Tuesday and she went out and bought items that felt safe and familiar to her. 

I understand this review probably sounds incredibly harsh but we&apos;re on the West coast, there are far to many good restaurants serving food from south of the border to deliver an experience like this... especially when you have such a great alternative across the bridge on 45th street.

The staff are friendly enough and they keep the area clean enough but that&apos;s not enough to keep me coming back.","Pecado No Bueno.

Will not return. You order at the front and they bring your order to your table. Their staff are very friendly, that&apos;s the only reason I put two stars. But the food is bland and overpriced. It was better before the fire that put them out of commission for a year or so...so maybe all their recipes went up in the flames.",Place is garbage as far as the wait staff is concerned. Food is ok. Usually cold by the time you get it. Ive never had a good experience at this location.  The one in Fremont is great! The food tastes really good. Its just cold everytime. The wait staff treats you like you punched their lil sister if you even say &quot;good evening&quot; to them. This literally happened to me tonight. Told me I was being aggressive towards him. I was sober and being polite. Asked me if I was ok like 4 times as I was confused by his reaction. I sat quietly and watched a ball game feeling like garbage because of this person. Thanks a lot for taking my money though.,"I like this place a lot. It&apos;s just on the Eastlake side of Seattle. Very near to my workplace. It&apos;s Mexican joint with lots of options for lunch and breakfast. 
I have being here multiple times and I love their tacos. Ambience is also pretty decent. In summers you can actually sit outside and have your margaritas. Their chicken tacos and tiger prawns tacos is a must try. I have also tried their sandwich I.e Breakfast Torta. I liked that too. The bun was very soft and their chicken is always well cooked.","I&apos;m back. Went with wife for lunch. Much better...very good food. But lets wait, their systems are not stressed like before the pandemic. Anyone can keep a place clean when there are no customers. Welll.......almost anyone.",Love this place! The Baja Avocado Caesar with chicken is by far my favorite dish. Ambiance is great and especially on those rare sunny summer days it&apos;s lovely to have the option to sit on the patio.,"You can&apos;t go wrong with Luna! The service is great and the food is impeccable. My favorite are the tacos (can&apos;t go wrong with the al pastor or the carne asada) or the chipotle chicken dish. This usually comes with a side of rice, beans and tortillas, but on the &quot;secret menu&quot;, you can sub it out for pasta noodles and breadstick! Droooolll..... The sauce is creamy with a kick of chiptole and the chicken- OMG it is so tender, it literally falls off the bone. There&apos;s also a special &apos;Taco Tuesdays&apos; menu- who doesn&apos;t love deals?!

This is a family owned and operated restaurant (go support local!) which I love. They are the sweetest family!

Due to Covid, they made a walk-up window so it&apos;s easy for your to order and wait! Don&apos;t forget to get a shot of tequila while you wait! You can also order drinks to go.","Glad we ordered take out from Luna Azul! Loved the food, especially the Salvadoran pupusas and the enchiladas. Definitely will go again!","This place is amazing. Order from them now! You won&apos;t regret it. When we are able to gather again, I highly recommend you visit in person so you can enjoy their salsa bar and kind service.","Luna Azul was a great choice for take-out on a Monday evening after work.

Ordering from the walk-up window was fast and easy. Two entr√©es, an appetizer, and two side orders were all ready in about 12 minutes.

Ceviche was peachy, and the chicken with red mole really hit the spot. The chile relleno, meh, it was a bit ho-hum, but still got eaten without complaint.

The guacamole was a bit spicier than I had expected. The beans and rice that came with the red mole and relleno were flavorful. 

The ceviche with shrimp was especially appetizing, and it went well with the pico de gallo, corn chips, and tortillas.  I would definitely go back to Luna Azul again and stick with the ceviche.","I understand things are tough with covid, but I found not 1 but 2 bugs in my 3LP tacos tonight. I&apos;m really disappointed because the food here is DELICIOUS but 2 instances of bugs in the same single taco I just don&apos;t know if I can trust the quality of the food anymore","I failed to take photos because of how hungry I was (will try again next time, there will be a next time).

All I can say is walking in you do not feel like you&apos;re in Washington state anymore.  I&apos;m from the southwest and have been missing Mexican food baaad.  I got the chicken Chile relleno and it comes in a creamy tomato sauce.  They use oaxaca cheese in the Chile relleno and the sauce covering the plate was perfect.  The beans were good everything was good, nothing was dry. Bf got the Cali boy burrito with hongo and it was delicious too.  There&apos;s also a little salsa bar and we were given hot sauce.  Everything was devoured.  

I want to eat the entire menu but have a feeling I&apos;m going to keep ordering the chicken Chile relleno because it&apos;s my new favorite thing.","This Mexican restaurant is a hidden gem in the Greenwood neighborhood. I&apos;ve been here a few times to try different dishes and I liked them all

Their service is great: friendly and fast. The food was served nicely with big portions and reasonable prices. Make sure to try their salsa and hot sauces! So good!!","Decided to grab a order to go for dinner tonight. Ordered The Jay Park Burrito with a side of chips and guacamole. The burrito itself was tasty and filling. Definitely worth taking a short drive to Greenwood. They gave a generous amount of guac (very fresh) to compliment the chips. The staff were very friendly and got my order pretty quickly (no more than 10 minutes), great service.

I would recommend if you&apos;re around the area. I look forward to another visit soon to try out other dishes.",The pupusas are absolutely awful. It breaks my heart too because there aren&apos;t too many central American restaurants in the area.  I was disappointed by the lack of flavor.  Most likely won&apos;t go back,"We ordered vegetarian chili rellenos  but they appeared to be vegan on delivery. No cheese, no egg batter.  Beets and maybe yams inside. Not my thing for chili rellenos.  But  the sauce, rice and beans were all great. Speed of delivery was great. Next time I&apos;d pick up to avoid the issue, if I could tell the order was wrong.","Luna Azul was one of our stops on a recent vegan taco crawl, and they have great vegan options. We tried the: Cielo y Tierra, Garden, and Hongo tacos, and a vegan version of Chile Rellenos. I didn&apos;t care for the Chile Relleno - not because it wasn&apos;t good, but I don&apos;t care for it usually. My friends really enjoyed it and even ended up making tacos with all the goodness on the plate. 

The tacos however were OMG sooo good and cannot believe they are vegan. The tortillas are fresh, but they unfortunately didn&apos;t hold up too well to the amount of ingredients in the tacos. The taste of all the tacos were amazing, and the Cielo y Tierra was by far my favorite. 

The owners are very sweet and their story is so heartwarming. They are a little shop in Greenwood, that you definitely need to check out cause they have been flying under the radar.","The best Tacos in the city!

It&apos;s a very family like vibe at Luna Azul. The amount of food to cost ratio is easily the best in Greenwood if you&apos;re in the area on a budget. 

I personally get the street tacos pretty occasionally, but the carne asada burrito is easily my favorite! 

Luna Azul is perfect for a quick bite on the go and your supporting local business!","I just discovered this place recently, but must have walked by it many times.  It is now my favorite place in Greenwood.   The staff is great and the food is even better.","Ordered a good sized order &quot;to-go&quot; for a client lunch. 

&apos;Restaurant is Latino and eclectic. The food was as described and just as important the food was hot and ready to go when I arrived. The service was better than average and they even helped me carry it all to my car! 

My customers were very happy with their fish tacos (ordered the grilled). The guacamole was very good and so were the chips. The &quot;to-go&quot; forks and napkins are small and cheap so if you are getting a &quot;to-go order&quot; you might be happier if you supply your own utensils. 

I would definitely try Luna Azul again. 

Good prices and Fresh Food.","Nice and cozy place to try out tacos and their martini.
Tacos tasted really delicious . They have the spicy sauce to try out if you like to challenge on your spice levels . Staff was quite friendly and interactive . It&apos;s worth of a try. 
Thai place gets busy for a taco Tuesday after 7.00.",Big failure at the Cali Boy lol and it was $21 Not worth it especially if your actually from So Cal I do not recommend this place to anyone from Southern California,"We love this place! Delicious home cooked food. Our go to place for Mexican in our neighborhood.
You won&apos;t be disappointed.","Tried Luna for the first time today during lunch and I will definitely be going back asap! I believe Danny helped me out and he was very friendly and efficient. Food was delicious and I cant wait to try more on the menu. 
Danny&apos;s sliders...perfection!","The vegetarian puposas were tasty, and the curtido was nicely prepared. My husband&apos;s enchiladas in red sauce were fairly average.

What bumps this up to a 4 is friendly service, the chips and salsa that come with the meal for free (relatively unheard of in Seattle), and the fact that parking around here was much easier than expected.","Mediocre food, with incredibly uncomfortable and odd seating. The booths are really old, dirty and not well fitted to the room or the table. We moved a few times before finding a place we were willing to sit. The drinks were overly sweetened margaritas.   The food was fine, came out moderately closed.

Don&apos;t be fooled by the photos. Someone talented took them from angles that made the place look bigger and cleaner. It&apos;s not a place I will return.","Love this place. They&apos;ve somehow managed to make it look cooler with covid preventions in place. Food is delicious . It is hard to get a bad option food wise here. Stiff drinks too. Bravo! For those who generally go with tacos and  burritos, they are all excellent but I urge you to try pozole verde. It&apos;s a hearty pork soup perfect for a cold night, a fussy eater , or a hangover.

Try it! ¬°Sabrosa!","El Camino is still batting it out of the park for me.  That&apos;s a baseball analogy, so in other words, that&apos;s good.  Still love the food, the drinks, and the atmosphere is so warm and cozy even with the outside seating.  They have done a very nice job at COVID precaution offering seating that is self contained in mini tents or igloos as well as seating on the back deck that is in fresh air but covered.  All of the food and drinks here are good, but the place in general has heart in everything they do from the menu to the service to the d√©cor.  Still a favorite for me.","Stumbled into this place when looking for somewhere to eat and what a gem! The outdoor area out back was super nice, loved the vibe. I ordered the asada burrito, it was pretty good and they had a nice variety of hot sauces. I also had the holiday mezcal cocktail, I didn&apos;t love it and didn&apos;t taste the smokiness of the mezcal at all, but you win some, you lose some. Overall, great COVID-friendly dining experience!","Some of the friendliest service I&apos;ve encountered, but unfortunately the food quality didn&apos;t meet our expectations. We got the tostones with guacamole, which were actually just plantain chips, but the guac was really good. The carne asada tacos and shrimp tacos were really meh. Not a lot of flavor, too much cream sauce on the shrimp tacos, and the refried beans that came with both were not very flavorful. They both came with salsa verde that was too mild as well. For $14.50 per plate, they really weren&apos;t worth it. We&apos;ll go to Fogon or Agua Verde instead next time. Sadly, we haven&apos;t found a lot of good Mexican food in Seattle.

The drinks looked good and the back patio is cute, so this may be a good spot for happy hours if you just order some margaritas and guac.","Sat down for a light early dinner on their outside patio. Right away the waiter decided that our N95 mask were not good enough for him and asked us if we had another mask with us. 

We didn&apos;t. After his comment, he continued to act oddly and rudely. 

Example: he asked that if we were to talk to him, we had to stop eating, put our mask on, before asking questions or having any interactions with the staff. 

When we said we didn&apos;t have another type of mask with us, he put our water cups on a separate dining table, that was empty, next to us and told us we can fetch our water glasses. He stood 15 feet away to take our order. We were OUTSIDE on the patio, on a windy day. 

I understand the dangers of Covid. I understand some people are more freaked out than others. I don&apos;t understand the necessity to make a customer of your restaurant, you work for, feel SO UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE OF YOUR COMMENTS AND ACTIONS. He didn&apos;t have any issues with the table next to us not wearing a mask at all when he stood next to their table. But, my mask wasn&apos;t good enough???? 

Yes, I could have stood up and left. Maybe I should have. Well, I wanted to try the food. I also believe that one employee&apos;s mistake shouldn&apos;t tarnish the entire restaurant&apos;s reputation. 

0 star for the rude employee. 

Ok...enough of the neg, on to the food:

Shrimp tacos- 2 large (16/20 -size) shrimp in each taco wrapped in a double corn tortilla layered with cabbage dressed in a cream cilantro sauce, pico de Gallo and a side of their green avocado mix sauce. Yummy! 

Chips and salsa - good, not exceptional but not bad. Chips are crispy, lightly salted, little bit of oil residue. 

Overall, the food was good. 3+++ for the food.",Cute spot with outdoor covered seating! Great ambiance and the food was good with great margs would recommend,"I absolutely love the back patio. Heated lamps, outdoor fireplace, super cute decor. The food isnt authentic Mexican but super tasty. I tried the shrimp quesadilla which was crispy and served with guac. I love my quesadillas crispy. Also tried the veggie burrito, loved it. Its pumpkin based, slightly sweet and drenched with a red sauce. The flan was a nice a finish. Overall love this place and will come back especially for the cute outdoor seating.","I&apos;m unsure why this place isn&apos;t 5 stars! We came on a sleepy Sunday afternoon as we toured around the area and were delighted that they had HH. We sat at the bar which gave us a chance to chat with the bartender and main server who was an absolute sweetheart. The margs were great, the well drinks were strong, and while I only had tacos they were perfect street bites. 
The ambiance is what took it over the top for me whether in the dining room or their adorable patio. Cute date spot or fun with friends if I lived locally I&apos;d be here all the time.","The food was only okay. We ordered two soups to go--the pozole verde and the tortilla soup. The pozole verde was the better of the two, but the tortilla soup was fairly bland. The service here was very slow and unfortunately somewhat rude. We were asked to wait outside and the server emphasized that they would bring the food out to us when it was ready. Once we went outside, a man came and asked us to stand much further away, and suggested a place half way down the street, because of COVID. So we moved where they suggested and waited 30 minutes for two bowls of soup. After the long wait, I went inside to ask about our order and the same man rudely said &quot;well you have to come in to get your food, we don&apos;t bring it out to you&quot; and looked at me like I was stupid. I told him the other waitress said the exact opposite side and said they would bring it to us, he just shrugged and remarked &quot;well we&apos;re busy.&quot; I understand restaurants are struggling during COVID, and that&apos;s why we patiently waited outside for 30 minutes, but it&apos;s rude to be disorganized and then treat your customer like they can&apos;t follow directions...we will be frequenting other Fremont restaurants with better service and food.",Fremonts go to spaces for tacos &amp; margs. This is one of those places that never gets old. The whole menu is good. Love the patio in the summer.,"Fun atmosphere, great food, attentive staff, &amp; had great precautions for Covid 

I went here for dinner with two other people. We all got something different (carnitas tacos, carnitas burrito, and enchiladas) and they were all super tasty","It&apos;s been awhile since I&apos;ve written a review, however, I couldn&apos;t be more excited to share our wonderful experience!!

The Ceviche starter and Pipian Verde Enchiladas were both off the charts fresh and delicious! 

Ceviche: Fresh fish, citrus, sweet, yet firm mango all expertly diced with crisp tortilla chips and perfectly ripe avocado! Perfection on the patio.

Pipian Verde Enchiladas with portobellos, peppers and cheese: Vegetarians and Carnivores will not be disappointed! This gorgeous green sauce is rich and nutty without feeling heavy. The chef really achieved great depth of flavor and yet the savory plump mushrooms completely shine on their own. The colorful addition of julienned radish and cilantro on the top added a bit of crunch and a nice splash of contrasting color. All of this tucked into the softest tortillas... I can&apos;t wait to go back!! Seriously, the cooks here are amazing. 

Margaritas: Strong and tangy! A vacation in every sip. 

Ambiance: Festive, colorful, artistic decor, AND soul music! Yes yes yes! 

Service: Professional, prompt and very friendly. I also really appreciate the safety precautions in light of covid. Everything was very clean, and the table even included a bottle of sanitizer. 

I&apos;ll tell ya, I&apos;m picky when it comes to 5 star reviews and Mexican food. El Camino is my new favorite getaway in Fremont. I&apos;m really happy this place is open and I want to give them all the support and props they deserve. Thank you for making my day a little brighter! Xo","I was wandering around Fremont on a Monday afternoon, checking out the hood.  It was interesting, in a Haight Asbury way.  I wanted to get to a bar and gab, but most places were closed.  Fortunately, El Camino was open, and I found an empty place at the bar.  

It took a few minutes to get my cocktail, and the bartender was too busy to engage.  I don&apos;t like that.  My kind of bartender is there to pour, mix and talk.  I don&apos;t need a robotic personality doing a job.  My kind of bartender is a professional; mixing drinks, telling stories, listening to patrons, engaging.  It&apos;s an old school profession.  I have no time for &quot;new school&quot; techno disengagement. Bartending is more than a job. A good bar is a social center, confessional, and an escape from the monotony.  The bartender is this symphony&apos;s conductor.  Don&apos;t drop the baton.

What saved El Camino were the tunes: Jackie Wilson, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, and the Four Tops, brought a little Great Lakes soul to the El Camino.  I licked my chops in rhythm, as the vodka soothed my sensibilities. 
The only thing missing was Gypsy Rose at 48 cents a pint. Mercy, Mercy, Mercy. I struck up an awkward conversation with a patron at the bar, Seattle doesn&apos;t warm up to strangers.  But, that&apos;s okay.  It&apos;s becoming the American way.  Seattle is an archetype of the 21st century city.  Warmth and friendliness are not integral parts of that equation.  It&apos;s more about efficiency and productivity sadly.  Again, I&apos;m old school. 

I picked up my Uber outside El Camino, reflecting on Seattle and the 21st Century.  Dot Com new construction flashed by, and I knew my time had become a vestige of the past.  The Temptations tune &quot;Ain&apos;t Too Proud To Beg&quot; hit my head, and I leaned back in my seat, reminiscing of a better time and a better city.","Low quality food, small portions, average service - many other better dining options in the area.  Spent $70 for 3 basic meals (burrito, etc), no beverages.  Left hungry and disappointed.

Looks like they&apos;re getting higher ratings because 1) they&apos;re open during COVID, 2) they offer curbside pickup, and 3) outdoor seating.

None of these would bring me back.",They&apos;re doing takeout! Decent food but they get an extra star for having an incredible cleanliness and disinfecting policy in place. They disinfect your credit card when they give it back to you and have a cup for cleaned pens and used ones when you sign your check. You can also get margaritas and other booze to go!,The food is amazing!! Our go to for Mexican food! I always love the pork burrito or carne asada tacos.,"Not horrible, but not great. While I can&apos;t speak to much of the food, what I did order was very mediocre. The some what saving grace to this place is the cute decor, outdoor patio, and happy hour everyday 4-7. 
I ordered A house margarita along with chips and queso and salsa. The queso sadly was not great. It had a tiny bit of chorizo but the queso it self was grainy as if the flour binder was not cooked out correctly. The salsa it&apos;s self was OK. Also the house Margarita was pretty standard. All in all nothing spectacular. Staff was nice. Pricing was So so. Not sure if I&apos;d come back unless it was a sunny drinking day on the patio.","Came here with a group of 8 and loved that it didn&apos;t feel too cramped. The space is very colorful and feels cozy. The food itself wasn&apos;t bad but wasn&apos;t amazing, I think you come more for the ambiance! 

Margaritas here are pretty strong imo, just a heads up if you&apos;re planning on a boozy night.","This place is muy excellente (very excellent), the food is very authentic and delicious too. I went in with a group of gal pals and we all loved the food. My carnitas enchiladas were very tasty. The servings are substantial. Our drinks rocked too.

This place has a very casual atmosphere, feels like a place in which you are always welcome.

The staff was very efficient.

I am definitely a fan of the food, drinks and facility. I will return the next time I&apos;m in Seattle. Looking forward to bringing my better half in, next time.

ps. love that they were open early, when we were ready to eat.",Don&apos;t understand why this place doesn&apos;t have a 5 star review! The shrimp tacos were the best I ever had! Also the service is amazing! Thank you El Camino,"I would give this establishment 0 stars If it wasn&apos;t for¬†the good employees there.
&quot;Conditions of entry&quot;.. wear a mask or cloth covering your face. The hostile employee shown on the image, flips out on me and immediately demanded me to leave for not wearing a proper mask on his opinion. All while he was serving food with his face uncovered, discharging his breath all over the food line. I clarified to him that I was in fact complying with the rules. Then he decided to aggravate the situation by walking around the counter while cursing, getting on my face, trying to intimidate me leave lol

I&apos;ve visited¬†this restaurant for years and I have¬†witnessed¬†this guy and another employee in the back grill treating other customers and even their fellow employees with a nasty attitude.","Burritos were great! They followed all the Co-vid process. The store was very clean. Masks required.
Fast service!","This is my first time at a Qdoba and first off I was completely lost as how to order. I would assume it was like chipotle and it was. Since this was my first time, I was hoping the staff would explain the different options to me, but the staff seemed like they just wanted to keep moving the line. Mind you, this wasn&apos;t a busy time and it was me and someone else as customers.

Parking is easy as it has a parking lot shared with other businesses. Just pay at the pay box or from your phone.

I would have to say I am huge fan of Qdoba. Portion sizing is okay, but the flavor is the difference. The brown rice is more like Spanish Flavored rice. The chicken is nice and grilled with good flavor. The sauces have a huge variety and I tried all of them except the really spicy one. I can&apos;t really tell much of a difference but a tip from me is to get it on the side and pour a little bit for taste. The best part is, the guacamole is free and is not extra cost.

Overall, this Qdoba is alright. Staff isn&apos;t as friendly and seemed a little annoyed. The portion size isn&apos;t as generous as Chipotle and I was still hungry after. Pricing is fair. Flavor is great for what I was able to eat. Recommend trying Qdoba, but maybe find one with better customer service if you are new like me.","Been craving Mexican food then decided to order right here. I&apos;m honestly wondering about the negative reviews, because I think the food was great and pretty tasty! Queso diablo is the best, especially if you love to taste that spicy thang.

Beef brisket bowl was so yummy, but I only got a &quot;few&quot; bites of it because that was my husband&apos;s dinner.  ( I got the pork adobo bowl) Honestly, the photo that I&apos;ve taken didn&apos;t do any justice. Food looks better in real life. Lol 

Order up my friends!",The general manager is a really mean person. They  do not treat their staff well and is giving them starvation wages. They have no sense of customer service or how to behave in a restaurant.,GREAT SERVICE. Very impressed for a chain. Also their Impossible burritos are SO GOOD. Highly recommend!,"This Qdoba deserves special recognition because of the staff member here. Didn&apos;t get his name but he was the only one making food and had long hair (bilingual too). 

He was fast efficient and had such a strong sense of customer service. He was generous on portions without going overboard or skimpy.
When I loaded a lot of ingredients on the burrito  as he wrapped it, the tortilla RIPPED. Every other QDOBA I&apos;ve been too would just wrap aluminum foil and serve it... NOPE not this Spanish Casanova, he heated another tortilla and double wrapped the ripped part in seconds.... he was kind enough to give free chips too! 

This is the kind of service that is lacking in all hospitality establishments, but this Qdoba has a superstar doing phenomenal work. I&apos;d hire him in my company in a heartbeat! 

Give this guy a raise and keep him in close otherwise someone else will pick him up!",I&apos;ve ordered from QDOBA Mexican eats several times now. The food is ALWAYS GREAT AND FRESH!! Thank you for the great food!!!!!!,Usually a regular. I&apos;d rather eat somewhere else employees usually not rude their was one named Beverley I had my mask below my nose it always likes to make it past my nose. She asked me to put it up then she started to be rude about it when I explain how my mask goes down on accident she was aggressive when theirs other ppl I the building with their mask down past their nose.,This place has been neglected by me due to its location. Tonight I had no idea what to eat and decided to give it a try. Ordered a Chicken burrito bowl. I asked for pretty much everything so it was huge. Definitely more than enough for one meal.,"Weird that I have to ask for queso 3 times, there&apos;s nobody else in the restaurant, and still alas I finish my meal without ever getting queso. I currently have 3 chips left. Let&apos;s see if you remember before I finish. Doubt it.","I would give them more stars, but one of their employees (possibly the manager) just literally accused me of stealing food. I put in an order for five people and they forgot one of our taco orders. I drove all the way back with the receipt and she first denied they had forgotten part of our order. I politely told her they definitely had and she rolled her eyes and said &quot;people have been stealing food all day&quot; and said she would &quot;make it just this once.&quot; Unbelievable. Otherwise, the food is great, we love Qdoba.","I had already eaten dinner (thank you Trader Joe&apos;s), but the dab pen sent me through the doors of Qdoba. 

One friend&apos;s order: nachos with chicken, and just about everything else.

&quot;The nachos are a great option if you&apos;re a stranded Texan because you get free queso and miss that in your life,&quot; said my stranded Texan friend.

The order (my order): chips and guac because like I said earlier, I&apos;d already eaten.

The people were so nice. We came in like 30 minutes before closing, and one guy behind the counter gave me so many chips, I felt like I was holding a warm baby in my hands. 

My other friend got a taco. I forgot what she said about that, but it was a taco.

Thank you Qdoba.","Decent food and free guac! They have a lot of meat choices and all fairly priced. I&apos;ve gotten bowls and burritos here before but today I tried out a knockout taco! The two timer was awesome. Great texture and the meat was delish! Man I wish I got a bowl or burrito though, the guy making them today was LOADING THEM UP! Like twice as much as the Tex-mex competitor a few blocks away does. 

I wish their bowls (the physical thing) held up better and didn&apos;t degrade so quickly. I always have to transfer my food to a different container before eating or else my desk/table/whatever will be soaked by the time I&apos;m done.","Just got bad food and bad attitude. Came in with my family and got the skimpiest tacos I&apos;ve ever had. They seemed annoyed, had a bad attitude and the food was bad.  Perhaps they were annoyed because I had free entree coupons. My company regularly gets catering from this location and we spend between $500 and $800 each time. I would think that is worth three or four entree coupons but apparently it&apos;s not...I would have rather paid money and actually got a real meal.  I will strongly consider using Chipotle, taco del Mar, taco Time or any other Mexican establishment for our catering next time instead of here.","Just came in 20-30 min before closing on 7/28/19 and two of the guys working tonight were incredible.  Everything was so smooth I was able to get in and out, seriously some of the best staff I&apos;ve ever seen. Also the place was clean and the food tasted great. Thanks guys!","I had a craving.  A craving for Qdoba.  Usually only satisfied when I&apos;m flying through SeaTac, on a recent visit to Seattle I was more than pleasantly surprised to find one right across the street from where I was parked.  And, bonus (especially for their busy U-district location) this one had free parking in the back.  So I pulled in, got in line (it wasn&apos;t long at 2pm on a Thursday) and ordered my usual chicken burrito.  Except, wait, I saw they had a new option: tequila lime chicken!  That sounded good, so good that I actually didn&apos;t even notice the raised eyebrows on the guy at the counter when I ordered it.  &quot;Are you sure?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Yes,&quot; I said.  &quot;You want the TEQUILA LIME CHICKEN, right?  Not the regular chicken?&quot; he repeated.  &quot;Duh, of course, yes!&quot;  I said.  (Okay, I didn&apos;t actually say duh.)

The burrito was quickly prepared (I love that you get to pick your own toppings as you go), but when I bit into it I suddenly realized this guy&apos;s questions had been warnings.  The taste was really really bad.  I can&apos;t even really put my finger on it.  Just...don&apos;t.  Not sure what&apos;s in it but if it&apos;s tequila and lime I&apos;m never having a margarita again!","Location is far from campus compared to Chipotle, but I personally think Qdoba&apos;s meat options taste better than Chipotle&apos;s. There is a private parking lot if you decide to drive. Service is decent, they just create your meal, nothing too special. 

Food is pretty good for a fast food Mexican grill. I would suggest a smothered burrito! Fat burrito with any ingredients topped with their special sauce. I think I can eat quite a bit and got decently full halfway through, so good portions! Also, free guac! Check it out if you&apos;re in the area!","Been here before and the service was good.    Came here on May 5th, but would have come here any other day.   They had one person helping, rarely two.   Long line.   Kept saying others were out doing catering.    Well happy your business is that busy but why don&apos;t you have enough staff to fill lunch time orders.    Out of steak, ok how about shrimp.   Out of shrimp, ok how about brisket.   Out of brisket how about that bland dry chicken then.   

The poor employee behind the counter was getting grief from others.     Put your customers first and staff correctly.  

Need we talk about the food left unwrapped in the dinning room?","I don&apos;t think you can compare Qdoba to Chipotle, they&apos;re not that similar in my opinion. I feel like Qdoba has more different entree options. If I had to compare Qdoba to another burrito joint it would probably be Mucho Burrito. With that being said, Qdoba wins!

I had only ever tried Qdoba catering because my office loves to order it. The catering is good and I&apos;m glad I got to try it out in the restaurant! The space is clean, bright, and open. The workers are very friendly as well!

I ordered a chipotle smothered burrito which was great! It&apos;s a little bit pricier than your normal fast food burrito joint but the sauce and guac comes freeEEEeeEe! The size of my burrito was just right for me- not overstuffed and I didn&apos;t have to ask for extra rice. The chipotle smother was tasty with just the right amount of spice. I sat down with a bottle of cholula (one of my favs, so excited that they have it!) and didn&apos;t use it because I&apos;m kinda a weenie when it comes to spice and the level on the sauce was just perfect. 

I have two types of Mexican food cravings: the fresh cilantro-lime kind, and the cheesy bean kind and Qdoba caters to both of those cravings!","I love TDM, and to me, it is comfort food.   The size of their Mondo Burrito is just right - not too small, and not so big, that you have a hard time eating it and it spills all over the place.  I &quot;peel as I eat&quot;, and have no problem.   Yes, it is fast food, but it hits the spot for me.  The employee is friendly and makes you feel welcome.  There isn&apos;t a lot of seating, but it is enough.  It is always clean - floors, counters, tables, etc.

Parking:  I take the bus, so don&apos;t have to think about it.  There is a parking lot on the upper level above this business, and I think customers of TDM are welcome to use it free.  Or else park on the street.","Went here with my roommate after a day of shopping! We were talking in line about how good it would be to be able to smother your burrito in sauce, and they were able to do that! (go wet option on the menu- enchilada sauce or queso).
This is a pretty standard taco del mar and I would normally just give it three stars (convenient, decent food at a fair price). However, the staff working were super nice and accommodating, and made the experience even better than usual! We ordered a ton of food for ourselves and they didn&apos;t seem annoyed at all (I&apos;ve had that experience a lot in restaurants). They thought it was funny and were super helpful while we were taking a while deciding what to get. Overall, I really do like taco del mar, and I also really like this location! Recommend for a quick bite","So disappointed! They are advertising beyond meat being available, so I stopped in. The place was quiet. Just one guest eating and myself. I asked for the beyond meat and the woman stated they didn&apos;t have it. I clarified, and asked if they were out? She said no, that she hadnt made it that day. So frustrating! I had walked to go get my lunch and now could eat very little on the menu. I then settled for a wet burrito with beans. During the order I couldn&apos;t hear her and had to ask her multiple times to speak up which I know is partially due to the mask, but then my were burrito somehow became a normal burrito..? I don&apos;t know. Obviously some miscommunication that is leaving l with a very unsatisfactory lunch. Hope to try again another time. I will probably call ahead to make sure they have all items on the menu.","Delicious food, clean, nice tables, friendly and accommodating staff. They were happy to give me sides at no cost, ( sour creme, salsa,etc. even gave me a container for my dog to drink water. A great place for Mexican food at a great price. Btw, it is not the definition of a whole in the wall.",It&apos;s one of the better Taco Del Mars in the area but I just don&apos;t understand why the guy that works there does not wear a mask.,"My friend and I went in today and we both ordered kids cheese quesadillas. But, when the employee was making my friends order, they made a burrito instead and when they made my order they charged me $8.00 for a $5.00 kids quesadilla, yet, my friend and I ordered the same thing and she only charged her $3.00. Then, when my friend went to clarify she ordered a quesadilla and not a burrito, the employee yelled at her and said she was lying and that she had videos of us ordering a burrito? She said we needed to leave because she said that she had cameras and she could get us in trouble for lying about our order. She was on the phone the entire time, and was very rude. Anyways, probably not going back, and my friend didn&apos;t get her quesadilla :(","Didn&apos;t heat up the fish and made fish tacos w/lettuce instead of cabbage. When we asked for a re-make, since fish was stone cold, they refused. Would not give a refund either. Never going back.",Very disappointed to find that they closed today at 3pm. I showed up with my family to purchase a huge order only to find a hand written note on the door indicating they closed early today.,Love Taco Del Mar but this one isn&apos;t open during their posted hours (even the ones on the door). It&apos;d be nice if they would follow their hours or change them.,"I prefer Qudoba or Chipotle over TDM. This location is convenient but there is no parking except for on the street. The prices are pretty high for the quality of food and the employees seem to work very fast and sometimes sloppy (I understand rush hour but still) The meats seem flavorless and the ingredients are not be freshest nor best quality.

Bottom line I only come here when I don&apos;t have other options.","It would be disingenuous to give this place any less than 3 stars because I eat here at least once a week. This is decent but not amazing fast food. I usually get a fish taco or a fish burrito.

Things in its favor: 1) Fast, 2) Cheap, 3) Kid-friendly, 4) Relatively healthy and 5) Decent ingredients. I actually worked at a TDM about 15years ago, so I can speak to the food quality. It isn&apos;t the Holy Land of Chipotle, but it isn&apos;t the reconstituted hell of Taco Bell either. 

Things going against this place 1) Hard to find parking, 2) Hit and miss service, 3) Hit and miss quality (soggy rice one day, runny beans another...) and 4) small dining room","Staff was super nice and incredibly friendly, but portions were small for the price and food quality was unfortunately very low.","I hate to do this, but the last several times I&apos;ve visited this Taco Del Mar, it seems that the food has gone downhill. It&apos;s in our neighborhood, but if we are having a craving for Taco Del Mar, we head up to Northgate to the Taco Del Mar up there, where the food is consistently really good. I&apos;m writing this review so that the owners might take notice, and make some changes to how they&apos;re preparing their food. Go up to the Northgate Taco Del Mar and take notes! We would come back if the food was better. It&apos;s not like the food is terrible, but it&apos;s just not nearly as good as it used to be.","When everything else in Seattle is becoming pretentious, outrageously overpriced, and frequently disappointing, it&apos;s a relief to come and get a decent, relatively nutriitious meal for $7.","The negative review here dont really make any sense. 

If you have had Taco Del mar then you know what you are getting. Like one of the other reviewers said. Its fast food Mexican but not nasty like taco bell. What I will tell you is that this place is nice, clean and fast! They happen to make there burritos much larger and more stuffed (and at the same price) than other Taco Del mar&apos;s. Which is why I choose this place above the others.

Also. I have never seen a &quot;vegan&quot; sign any where in the place so I don&apos;t know what that negative review was about. I think the lack of protein is messing with her eyesight.


Its Taco Del Mar! $5 burritos, you cant really argue against its merits. If you factor in the quality to cost ratio you come out ahead.","I just finished a taco-eating-contest with myself. (I won)

As usual, the fish tacos were excellent. Yeah yeah, it&apos;s fast food and if you&apos;re looking for the best taco of your life, don&apos;t come here. But this is a solid four-star fast food place. 

And the employees are SO nice. Another customer was clearly a regular, for they new her order exactly. Then, when the guy asked me if I wanted a punch card and I said no, he said it was no big deal. &quot;I&apos;ll remember your face, and the 10th time you come in you can still get $5 off&quot; he said. Such a sweetie! (And no, he wasn&apos;t flirting)","Great food and they offer things like cilantro and jalapenos too, that don&apos;t normally (in my experience) go on some dishes. I really appreciate that! These guys deliver really great service too, very friendly, down to earth people, not focused on your wallet, just plain old nice.","Sometimes I hate when I&apos;m hungry, because then I eat at places like this. And then I want to punch myself in the face afterwards.",Really great consistent burritos. Friendly service. The fish was fresh and well prepared.,"I don&apos;t have any problems with this place. They serve good, standard Taco Del Mar items. The staff seems marginally better trained than the staff at the one down the Ave, and it&apos;s nice to sit in the restaurant, nibble chips and tacos, and read the stranger or something. Feels very welcoming.","Ordered delivery from here twice. The Arepas are really satisfying.  They are crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. Stuffed with cheese, plantains, meat or beans, they&apos;ve become a comfort food lately.  Also the sauces they come with are fantastic: one is cilantro and mayo, the other more of a spicy chipotle mayo. Yum!

I&apos;ve tried the guan√°bana and maracuya (passionfruit) juices and I prefer the maracuya: was more flavorful and tart, less sweet.

Will slowly work my way through the menu. They&apos;re in the neighborhood, the quality and quantity is great for the price. So glad they&apos;re here.","Simply phenomenal. Kicking myself for not trying this place sooner. Have never had Venezuelan food before but these tequenos, empanadas, and arepas absolutely blew me away. I got the dominoe arepa and added plantains and the combo of textures and flavors, complemented by the accompanying cilantro sauce, was a delight. The cheese empanada also was unlike any I&apos;d had before, with a thin shell and generous white cheese filling. Very efficient takeout experience as well. Will be back ASAP.","Oh, hello! Conveniently located diagonally across from the amazing University Farmers Market I have been wanting to stop by for some Venezuelan treats for a long time. Last weekend after the market I decided it was time. I called to make sure the wait wouldn&apos;t be long and the girl said it would only be 15 min or so for my order. I came over ten minutes later and they were just packaging my order up. I had planned on going home and making a mushroom and cheese omelet but ended up ordering tostones and vegetarian arepas instead. Not only did I not have to cook, but I savored my delicious bites of Venezuelan staples. The girl who took my order and ran the checkout was nice and the food was great. I will put my order in as soon as I enter the market next time and eat outside on their patio seating outside next time. I&apos;m so glad they are on 50th just off of the ave.","Was craving something different so we ordered pickup from Arepa Venezuelan Kitchen.
We ordered the Reina Pepiada, the Best Bart and the Mini Arepas.
It was a great dinner! I&apos;d only had venezuelan food once before and I really liked the arepas.
My favorite was the reina pepiada - also make sure you ask for extra cilantro sauce, trust me, you will want it! 
The best bart was a biiit greasy but delicious, just make sure you have enough napkins available!","So glad we checked this place out today. We sat at their outside seating since we had a dog with us. The service was good and food came out pretty quickly!!

We ordered the following:

Chicken Empanandas (4.5 star): Great empanadas, just wish it had a lil kick to it but that didn&apos;t stop me from devouring it

Tequenos (5 star) : these are favorite Venezuelan side dish so I had to get it and it was definitely worth it!! It&apos;s like Venezuelan mozzarellas sticks but A LOT better

Reina Pepiada Arepa and Pabellon Arepa (4 start): I haven&apos;t had many Arepas before, but this was so amazing. The flavor is so different than the others 

Their sauces are so good, make sure to try them all. I wish I could just buy them at some store... they really make the food taste ever better somehow!

Their drinks also were amazing :)","This is my first time having Venezuelan food and I just can&apos;t believe I&apos;ve been missing out on this amazing cuisine my whole life. I got the Catira Arepa which had shredded chicken and yellow cheese, it also came with a cilantro-based sauce and a spicy creamy sauce. The Arepa was a little crispy on the outside and just buttery soft on the inside. Each bite just melted in my mouth, it was so good! They look small from the pictures, but they really fill up the arepa w/ lots of chicken or any other filling you end up getting. One is definitely enough :)","I was today years old that this building was actually a restaurant not a residential house (!). I had teque√±os (cheese sticks), a chicas arepa, and a flan as the first two seemed popular.

Overall, they were fresh and delicious! Flan was okay but I&apos;m fine with it since it doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;s housemade. Would come back again!","Visited this place on a hungry Tuesday afternoon.  It&apos;s my first time to try an arepa (a ground maize dough) sandwich.  I tried their &quot;Little Piggy&quot; arepa (signature pork tenderloin, fresh tomatoes, fresh spinach and cilantro sauce)...simple, seasoned well and filling.  I liked their fried empanadas made with &apos;masarepa&apos; cornmeal.  I specially  enjoyed their chicken and beef empanadas.  Eat both arepa and empanadas while warm and enjoy the cilantro sauce and spicy sauce that goes with it.  I can&apos;t wait to go back.","My Arepa was so good I immediately went back and ordered a second half way through eating my first one. I took photos but my phone died and I&apos;m using a new phone. Since I plan to go back again I will be sure to get better photos. Order any arepa, you won&apos;t be disappointed. Well, I guess the second one felt like the rushed it trying to get it to me because the guacamole and cheese were majority to one side. Would have been better had it been more evenly spread out, which I manually did myself and yes amazing, but messy. See you guys soon, like this weekend soon. Lol","My Ecuadorian friend has been begging me to try this place out. I never had an arepa before, so I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect. Unfortunately, my Ecuadorian friend was working on my day off so I had took another friend instead (also provided me with an excuse to come back again).

I ordered the Pabellon Arepa which contained shredded beef, cheese, and fried plantain. It was the epitome of a stick to your ribs comfort food. If I hadn&apos;t played tennis before eating, I would not have been able to finish it. The thick rice &quot;buns&quot; and the hearty brisket made the arepa very rich and dense. With that said, the arepa flavor was exceptional and had both savory and sweet notes.

The restaurant is a house converted into a restaurant and so it&apos;s a fairly tight cafe. However, they have patio seating too. The restaurant also has plaques with positive sayings posted on the walls adding to the overall homey vibe.

Service was good and they have self-serve water near the entrance.

Overall: 4/5 for food, 4/5 for service, 5/5 for atmosphere","Really bomb arepas, fairly priced, in a super cute repurposed house. You order at the counter, then find your seat, and bus your own table. Will definitely be back if I&apos;m ever looking for a super quick, casual meal. 

Want to try the empanadas next time!","Their arepas are fairly dense and really filling. Enjoyed pretty much all the arepas we ordered (reina pepiada, pabellon, cochino felix) - it&apos;s probably a matter of preference but the cochino felix was my favorite out of the three.

Made the mistake of ordering pickup on GrubHub and found out when I got there that the prices are higher on the platforms as opposed to in-person.",Delicious and very filling. The owner is Venezualian and he is SO friendly and excited to share Venezualan food with you. Go support this business!,"It&apos;s a crime I haven&apos;t left a 5 star review given how much I&apos;ve feasted here over the past 5 years. I swear I&apos;ve seen heaven&apos;s gate on a few occasions. I always get the pabellon, but have tried a handful of other items that have been excellent. I feel full but not bloated when I&apos;m done, and the pabellon hits so many flavor and texture spots for me in one dish. Consistent in deliciousness, though some arepas have been better than others in the crispiness of the corn cakes gets, the softness (cooked-ness) of the beans, and the size/cut of the plantains (some have been a bit too big). But I only notice this because I get it so often ha. No real complaints here.

I deeply miss sitting inside at a table with the bottles of sauce at my disposal (squirt per bite is the way to go)! 

Please support this family-owned business now and forever!",BEST AREPA IN TOWN! I never had such an amazing arepa in a long long time! The dips are great too. Highly recommend.,"I can&apos;t say enough great things about this spot! We&apos;re so lucky to have such a delicious and unique representation of Venezuelan culture here in Seattle  if you don&apos;t know what arepas are, think of a pupusa made into a gyro. If you don&apos;t know what a pupusa is, think of a thick, soft pita bread stuffed with Latin food goodness!
The arepas are made to order and the flavor is spot on! The sauces also pair so well with the empanadas and the more basic arepas. Give them a try!!",Fantastic! I had the Pabellon Arepa and the Bart&apos;s Best. Both were really good. I got there 15 minutes before closing and they didn&apos;t mind at all. The food was ready in less than five minutes.,"Mmmm... I really... really.... really love this food.

I didn&apos;t even realize it was right next to the great theater - I&apos;d only ordered delivery/had someone pick it up, but finally went to the actual place and it was even better.

Big fan of: Tequenos- basically the cheese sticks of your dreams, Reina Pepiada Arepa is like the chicken salad taco you wished you thought of, Pabellon Arepa is sweet, savory and JUST SO GOOD. 

Passionfruit juice to drink please.

Damn, I think I need to go back tonight now that I&apos;m all excited...","Great authentic food and friendly staff !! The food reminded me of good times living in Venezuela , a must try !! The Reina Pepiada and fried plantains are great","Never had Venezuelan food prior to trying this place out, but the reviews here got me convinced I had to go and I&apos;m glad I did.
This place has some really hefty portions at its price and is perfect for college students looking for a cheap and filling meal. I got two arepas, one Pabellon and one pork one as well as the chicken empanadas. Every bite is just so hearty and comforting and jam packed with flavor. The filling is held with a crispy outer shell and the inside is so much meat its ridiculous. The Pabellon had beef, beans, and a plantain and everything about it is just so delicious. The pork one is a close runner up.
The empanadas were fresh and hot. Outside was still  crispy with a good amount of chicken filling. Not to mention they gave like 3 or 4 sauces that just go well with everything. I still think about that fresh green sauce, I dont know what it is.
Nearby students, youre missing out if you haven&apos;t been here","As far operational aspects go, this place is top notch.  In this COVID era, you are seated and scan a QR code with your smartphone for a menu - on which you place your order and pay right then and there via your phone.   Your food is brought out to you soon after for a completely touch-free experience.  

I have been here before the pandemic, and this place is normally pretty hopping.  Live music is a regular occurance, although it can make it feel a little cramped when someone is performing.  A patio area offers covered outdoor dining as well.  The food is also good, if a little on the pricy side.

Good food and a great overall experience.",I have only ordered delivery from this place. I loved the burgers and the packaging and handling was perfect. The burgers weren&apos;t soggy or cold by the time the food arrived. Definitely try the cowboy burger. It is one of my new favorite burger place.,Will go again and it was my first time there and a good experience you can order from your phone now and pay from your phone while you&apos;re sitting in the restaurant which is good to minimize in contact with people. But you can still order in person if you like. They don&apos;t take cash.I ordered the salmon kale salad very good,"After a busy, tiring day travelling around Seattle, went to Eureka! to grab a late night dinner - enjoyed the entire meal! Waiting for the food was the hardest part BUT worth the wait. 

Ordered a bunch of things to try: Eureka American burger, truffle cheese fries, fried mac-n-cheese balls and the cobb salad. Loved everything and felt full which is highly appreciated (keeping in mind that my mom and I tend to have big appetites). We don&apos;t live in Washington, so this was a treat and know I have a familar place to return to on the next trip!","Eureka! is spectacular all around! Service was quick and friendly, ordering was all done from our smartphones. That process was simple and easy, and of course an option to have a person come to the table was available as well. The drink selection is excellent and, to quote the servers&apos; shirts, &quot;no crap on tap&quot;.
We had four different entrees at the table, all were terrific. I had the spicy fried chicken sandwich, and I genuinely think it was the best piece of fried chicken I have ever eaten. Chicken nachos appetizer was also outstanding, and just the right size. 
It is a little pricy - notably on the $7.00 beers. But the food was definitely worth it. With drinks and tip and one app, dinner for four was around $170. But I would definitely go back!","This was an unremarkable experience bordering on offensive. The food was nothing to really write home about; pairing chicken strips with their honey mustard dip managed to just cancel both flavors out, resulting in a tasteless &quot;matter consumption&quot; experience. The food was overpriced. With absolutely zero warning anywhere in the store or on the mobile site they require you to use to order, they charge you a service fee and have the audacity to also leave a space for you to tip on top of that. They need to make it known as you&apos;re walking in that they&apos;re going to take more of your money, without your permission, than the cost of your meal + tax. It at least lets a customer make an informed decision on whether to spend there or not. 

Stay far, far away from this place. You can get better food for less elsewhere in Seattle, at places that don&apos;t presume to take extra money from you without informing you first.","We came here after a run. The entire University Village is packed with shoppers for the holidays. We waited for 20 minutes before being seated. The table has a QR code for scanning to speed up the process for ordering/paying and minimal contact, which is pretty cool. We ordered three different burgers, brussel sprouts, and nachos. The burgers were a-ok with two out of three burgers overcooked and one undercooked. The fries were fresh and crisp, along with brussel sprouts packed with flavor but a bit oily. The nachos were disappointing with the portion size and very minimal flavor as the ingredients were dumped on chips without any blend or harmony in taste.","Absolutely AMAZING! Wonderful service, delicious food and innovative restaurant technology that made my experience a breeze throughout my dining during COVID. You can order directly from your phone which minimizes contact with your server. Both the seating on the patio and under the tent is great with awesome heating lamps that keep y

Must try&apos;s:
1. TRUFFLE FRIES!! SO. GOOD. The truffle sauce that comes with the fries is huge. 
2. $7 Happy Hour Wild Child drink -- crispy and light watermelon flavor, so refreshing and perfect paired with the meal
3. Fresno Fig Burger is to die for! 
4. Crispy Glazed Brussels Sprouts - AMAZING. Delicious sauce! Caution--has peanuts for anyone that has allergies but simply request to take it out and the dish is still great!

You&apos;ve GOT to stop by this spot. 

I would order extra truffle sauce to dip your burger into. Absolutely amazing.","UPDATE:
I decided to give Eureka another go. Since returning, I&apos;ve seen more consistent service and food quality. So, I&apos;m chalking up my previous experience to be an exception. Additionally, I&apos;m glad they have been able to create a take out experience during COVID to try and keep the business running and employ staff. I&apos;ll also point out that after my first review, I received a kind response from the manager who invited me back. Although I didn&apos;t take up the offer to receive a gift card, I appreciate the ownership of the issue.","Okay, this place isn&apos;t my favorite spot ever. In all honesty, I find it a bit pricey. But their truffle cheese fries are awesome and I&apos;ve gotten them to go more than once on my way to QFC.
Their outdoor seating also looks nice.","Not very happy with this trip to Eureka. I ordered takeout on Uber Eats and it said it would be ready in 10-20 minutes. 40 minutes later, the restaurant was still &quot;preparing the order.&quot; I was waiting to go in until the order was marked ready so I wasn&apos;t unnecessarily inside the restaurant, but decided to go in and check. The order was ready and had been for who knows how long. The food was good, but barely warm by the time we picked it up. It&apos;s been 2 hours now and they still have not updated the app to say the food is ready.","They have a lot of promotions- Tuesday is half price for wine day! Great selection of whiskey , good food and COVID outdoor seating!","Came here with 2 people around 7 on a Monday and had no wait. 

Ordered a burger and fish n chips which came out like ~30 min later. Fianc√© wasn&apos;t too impressed with the burger and kept swiping bites at my Fish n Chips, which was  understandable because they were delicious!! Very well seasoned, hot, and HUGE fillets (I ended up eating with a fork). Fries were pretty standard. 

Service was okay. The staff were nice but didn&apos;t seem to come around too often, and I never got a re-fill of water. 

Overall, the venue was pretty nice for a more sporty, mellow restaurant vibe, and I might come back to try happy hour fare. 

Parking is also free and mostly ample in the attached garages to university village. 

Two entrees and a beer totaled $42.94 for us before tip.",Strongly recommended for a great burger and beer to match. Always a solid spot with good service.,"I met some friends for dinner at 6pm on a Sunday. The place was packed by were seated right away. The hostess and servers were incredibly friendly. The atmosphere is laidback and welcoming.  We ordered falafel bites and Mac and cheese bites for appetizers.  The mac and cheese bites were hot but very bland. Falafel bites were good. I ordered a cowboy burger and although it looked amazing, it was just okay. The burger had little seasoning and was very bland and the french fries could have been seasoned more too. 
This is definitely not a place to rave about.","With COVID, things have slightly changed. In order to buy food, you need to go to their website (or scan QR code) and purchase from there. It&apos;s actually pretty simple. What&apos;s nice is that they still offer patio seating if you want to &quot;dine-in&quot;.

I had the cowboy burger, and I feel that anything with onion strings makes it instantly gourmet. It was a really good burger with a homemade(?) BBQ sauce and a side of fries. I ate everything. Slightly more expensive for a burger of this quality, but I think overall a fair deal.","Received great service 
Weather was ideal for outdoor seating, surrounded by great guests (dogs!)
Ordered Napa chicken sandwich with sweet potatoes fries - excellent! Followed by Mac N cheese balls, lime soda &amp; ice tea, which were all very satisfying. 
Considering the sweet potatoes fries were delicious, we decided to order truffles fries to make the whole family happy. The order was expedited, but what we got was a beautiful cold/stale basket of fries.   What?
Staff (manager?) explained, but didn&apos;t quite make sense. 
Again, service is always friendly/professional and inviting.   Love that you can bring your furballs to dine with you (outdoor!).

Good luck, Eureka!",All of the waiters that helped us were so nice and it was extremely covid safe! We ordered and payed through our phones and the QR code on the table so it was extremely minimal contact and the food was amazing. Would definitely come again.,"Omg, I&apos;ve never had more amazing &quot;non service&quot; service in my life!! In the phase that this city is in during COVID right in this moment, this restaurant is adapting so well! We walked in and was met by a lovely girl in a mask who explained the run down to us. They currently are not serving patrons, but have a patio set up so you can order food and drinks (including alcohol), they bring it all out in togo containers with all the silverware (Togo) napkins and sauces you need. When you sit down there&apos;s a table tent with the QR code you scan that takes you to their website to order food and pay on making it completely contact-less. Kristen, a total and complete goddess, came out and answered any questions we had, and absolutely sold us on their summer cocktail. I think she even called it summer in a glass, which it totally was! I can&apos;t stress enough how wonderful and amazing Kristen was. She was so happy, nice, informative, and knowledgeable about Eureka and their menu. I was so excited to have someone help me who was so incredibly happy and willing to help me. 
Now the food. Omg, the food was better than before! I got the Napa burger (secret menu) with fried Mac n cheese balls, which were both delicious! The burger was cooked perfectly, and I love the pesto aioli. My friend got the jalapeno egg burger, which she said was really good, but wasn&apos;t her favorite burger, with the sweet potato fries, which are always bomb. They had a honey packet on the side, so she drenched her sweet potato fries in them. Our other friend got the Fresno Fig burger which is a perfect combination of tangy and sweet. Then we had to get the truffle fries like always, but we ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS get them tossed in the truffle sauce, they even snuck in 2 extra truffle sauces in there for us! 
This experience at Eureka was the best experience we&apos;ve ever had there and that&apos;s all thanks to the AGM Kristen and her team right now. She was wonderful, the food was fast and hot, and we left feeling happy and very full. Though I don&apos;t live in Seattle, I&apos;m going to be coming back again for Kristen, and for TRUFFLE FRIES. Thanks again Kristen!","ordered via doordash 4-5 times now...best (and biggest) chicken sandwich i&apos;ve had since moving to seattle. chicken tenders also go off. exceptional chicken quality (i am very picky, usually end up dissecting whatever meat is on my plate). happy to have found a place i can count on for consistency","This is the best spot for late night tacos in Fremont. They never let me down! Quick service, perfectly greasy tacos, cheap prices, and late night hours, what more could you ask for? 

My go to order is one chicken taco and one lengua taco. Really delish!","I ordered a pastor burrito, and got a tortilla filled with spicy red sauce and little bits of meat. What $10 burrito doesn&apos;t have cheese? The sauce was reminiscent of marinara, and the meat didn&apos;t have much flavor. 

Service was friendly and quick, but the gentleman who made my food didn&apos;t wear a mask or gloves. 

I probably should have gone with tacos instead of a burrito. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d try this place again. I regret not trekking a little further up the street to the (excellent) El Camion taco truck at Hale&apos;s.","While exploring Fremont with friends from out of town we stopped at the Taco Truck to try some of their street tacos. 
We got Asada‚Äã, carnitas, and lengua; and our Mexican‚Äã friend was more than happy to tell us that they are the real deal! And then you have people telling you that you can&apos;t find good tacos up here in the Pacific Northwest... Now you know better! 
They&apos;re inexpensive and delicious, and they offer catering!","I don&apos;t get why the reviews are so bad! I actually found this place while walking by and thank goodness I didn&apos;t look it up on Yelp first, otherwise I might have been deterred to trying it. I ordered the pastor and asada tacos, and boy, were they both awesome! Both super juicy, full of flavor, perfectly seasoning and not fatty at all! Served with finely diced onions, cilantro, a lime wedge and some radishes, these tacos were the ultimate treat and a steal at $2 each! These were seriously one of the best tacos I&apos;ve tried in Seattle!  Skip over these dated reviews, and make sure to try this place out ASAP!","Extremely slow, subpar food, and overpriced. Do yourself a favor and go to the El Camion taco truck up the street!","I waited for the entirety of an uber ride from Fremont to the U-District to eat a single taco.Meanwhile one of my friends thoroughly enjoyed her most recent purchase.

The order: 3 pollo, 1 vegetarian, 1 asada &amp; 1 carnitas (all tacos)

Before I smoked I offered a bite to my friend. She joyously remarked, &quot;you&apos;re a fool for offering this up to me.&quot;

I was a fool. In my last review I declared vegetarianism. How could I ever give up delicious meat tacos. The pollo tacos were so scrumptious that I crave a taco flavored burp.

&quot;I questioned &apos;is this soft? Is this crunchy?&apos;&quot; My friend (the one who ate her taco in said ride share) said after she finished off her order.

I&apos;m currently listening to Maggie Rodgers and am going to see her in concert in a few days. So my final remarks are this: both are worth going back to.","Fast, Cheap &amp; Furiously Good. What started as a starved late-night snack became one of my favorite things.

One night sometime after midnight, I was out with a group of friends for some late night drinks. As usual, we got hungry, but by that time, the kitchen at Brouwer&apos;s (where we were drinking) was closed, so we had to look elsewhere - the small Flair taco truck just up the street was the easiest answer, and who doesn&apos;t like tacos?

First impression looking at the menu: 1) Wow that&apos;s cheap! and 2) Dang, that&apos;s a lot of choices.

For under $10, I was able to snag 4 tacos. They&apos;re that &quot;street taco&quot; style you&apos;d expect from a good taco truck - couple small corn tortillas filled with your choice of meat, diced onions, cilantro, and the raddish. And Flair piled on a generous amount of meat.

In minutes and for less than the price of most cocktails, I was staring at a plateful of juicy, delicious smelling chicken tacos. One bite and I was in heaven. The chicken was incredibly juicy and seasoned to perfection, the meat to tortilla ratio was golden, and I felt better than if I had just downed a slice of pizza.

Since that first glorious night, Flair has become one of my favorite taco spots. I&apos;ve now had their chicken, beef, and lengua (tongue) tacos, and surprisingly, the lengua probably just edged chicken out as my favorite! They also have Mexican hotdogs, which my wife has ordered before and insisted was delicious.",I like em they cool and all bad staff tho improve the staff yall got my 5 star again until then I wont update the quality dropped a little as well but it was the staff I believe,"I&apos;ve almost never had a bad taco at a taco truck. In fact, those are always the best: picking up a cheap taco late at night from a truck and devouring it in the parking lot before heading off to the next adventure.

Flair Taco pretty much lives up to that scenario, but the taco wasn&apos;t as good as some I&apos;ve had. First, the service was so extremely slow. Their credit card swiping thing was broken and the touch screen on their phone was also working poorly. I was forced to wait like 5 minutes while the cashier was teaching the other person how to make tacos. There is good parking and always a crowd around at night time, even as the weather gets colder and colder -- usually a good sign!

The tacos are $2 each, which is cheap but more expensive than other taco trucks in the area. Also, I will mention that all the other options (quesadillas, burritos, tortas, etc) seem to be non-proportionally more expensive compared to the tacos. This makes it hard to try a few tacos and a quesadilla for that cheap price we all hope for. Still I&apos;m not complaining about price here. The meat options are good, and as expected. I went with the pastor, chicken, and beef tongue. The pastor had more of a carnitas texture than the traditional pastor, but it still had lots of flavor. The chicken was super juicy -- like dripping down your hand juicy! The lengua was chewy and tasty as well! 

There was just something missing. The tacos are a little smaller than I would have liked, but they were reasonably filled. Maybe it was the poor service that spoiled the food, or the fact that I was starving and should have gotten more than three. Either way, something about this place just didn&apos;t satisfy me as much as I had hoped it would. Maybe I&apos;ll have to come back some other time to try it again.","Flair Taco is bomb. I have been here twice now and I get the carne asada burrito, which never disappoints! Last time I also ordered a few carnitas tacos and they were bomb. This last time I was nervous because there was one white guy that didn&apos;t speak Spanish running the truck, and I was worried that they had changed management and changed the food, but it is still under the same owner and management and the food was the same! I would go here again for sure.",Some of the most delicious tacos I&apos;ve had. Wonderful staff as well. Let us sample some of the Carnitas and Carne Asada before trying and it honestly made the decision harder. You can&apos;t go wrong with Flair Taco.,"Out and about and looking for good authentic Mexican food, I saw this truck multiple times and felt reluctant to try the tacos and my hunch was right. I don&apos;t know who the owner is but when I went, I was helped by two white males swearing up and down making for an unprofessional dynamic since I didn&apos;t really care for the humor. &quot;You can&apos;t argue with f*cking delicious&quot;

I just want my asada tacos. Not some &quot;Ass tacos&quot; as said by the employee.

In the end, the result was as advertised. &quot;Ass tacos&quot;. They were runny, salsa wasn&apos;t well blended, meat wasn&apos;t very exciting and tortillas felt a little greasy and hard. The runny juice was watery and brown like it came from an ass.

The only reason I was reluctant in the past was because I barely ever see any actual Mexicans working and Mexicans eating the food. Being Mexican myself, I can see why. We&apos;re picky and us Mexicans enjoy authentic Mexican food. The white people dropping by can enjoy it all they want to feel cultured and get some grub but this Mexican is never coming back and will make sure my friends and family go to some better trucks for quality, flavor and authenticity.",I want to like this food truck since it&apos;s so close to home but the food is just so-so.  The quesadilla I ordered came out soggy and flimsy.  Not the standard crispy tortilla shell I&apos;m used to.  The Mexican hot was was pretty good thought. Good spice from the peppers and who can say no to bacon on a hotdog.,"Can we say hole in the way not even it&apos;s a roaming hole in the wall. After just coming from lunch we spotted this and couldn&apos;t possibly eat another bite. But I said I can&apos;t pass a $1.50 Taco. Well after 1 became 8 I&apos;m not kidding. I tried 1 of ever filling and didn&apos;t have a favorite. They are nice and tiny. You can take down many. Nicely topped with white onion, cilantro and radish. Sweetest ladies work inside. This is a hidden gem I suggest you seek out for a quick bite.","We went there last night and oh man,  this place is health risk. 14 hours later and me and my wife are  still suffering the consequences of eating 3 tacos. The health department definitely need to pay a visit to this place. This is my opinion based on experience,  hopefully owner will evaluate what went wrong with the food last night and improve. No interest in damaging this small business reputation",My wife is sick after eating there.  Not hospitalization sick but still.  We eat at food trucks at least twice a week and never have a problem.  I hate leaving bad reviews this seems a health risk rather than a petty preference on flavor profile or customer service.,"Flair Taco will have you styling and profiling aaalllll night long! Wooooo!!

Okay, so that was my Ric Flair impression and, if you don&apos;t know who that is, do a quick Youtube search then come back and finish reading this review.

Other than the name, this taco truck has nothing else in common with the 16 time world champion and hall of fame professional wrestler although their tacos are good enough to figure four leg lock most of their competitors into submission so I guess they have that going for them. Seriously, if there was a championship belt for tacos in Fremont, these guys would be holding it up high for all to see.

The tacos are cheap and delicious which is about all you can ask for from a taco truck and I can&apos;t seem to keep from stopping by whenever I am in the neighborhood. I have yet to try any of their other menu items although I have seen a lot of people order tortas and the burritos look pretty massive when handed out so I can only imagine all the deliciousness going on underneath that foil wrapper.

If you are in the area, give these guys a shot, they are fast, friendly, and will suplex you off the top of their truck if you don&apos;t like their food. Okay, maybe that last part isn&apos;t true but you get the idea.","Extremely poor excuse for tacos. Staff handled our money then started preparing the food without washing hands or using gloves. Young man preparing food had to be asked to use gloves. The meat on the tacos was non existent and NO SALSA WAS OFFERED?!  It was however added to the taco leaving it a sopping mess. 

Burrito was also ordered and couldn&apos;t get past the first bite. 

Once again! Taco trucks disappoint!!!!",Best tacos in Seattle hands down especially at this price point!!! You can never go wrong with the carnitas taco,"This is the best taco truck in town! Tacos should be cheap and delicious and this place nails it! The pastor tacos are my favorite. The owners also make their own salsa and the red sauce is fire!! The staff are all nice and will give you extra salsa if you ask-no charge. I eat here at least once a week because it is close to my house and always a delicious, cheap dinner or late night snack attack.","This is my favorite Cactus location. The ambiance is cozy and familiar, which is what I love this time of year.

First things first: they are on top of their game with COVID precautions. You must wait outside to be taken in, the seating arrangements are well spaced, they have a QR code system for viewing menus and paying for your meal, all staff are wearing masks, and they bring out your silverware in a cup wrapped with plastic wrap and a notice saying it was prepared in a sanitary environment with PPE. I haven&apos;t seen that before.

The food is fresh, flavorful, and generous portion-wise. I LOVE their vegetarian options! I ordered their portabello fajitas and oh. my. garden. I was so impressed with the amount of flavor! If you&apos;re vegan, you could ask for them without the cheese and sour cream on the side. I will definitely order this again. They also have excellent mocktails.

The staff is so friendly and helpful. I&apos;m used to being stared at like I have three heads when I order without meat/dairy and no alcohol but I really appreciate them not making me feel dumb.

Thanks Cactus!","I love this restaurant! I have been to many of the locations, and this one was perfect for brunch after a run. The location near the water in Madison Park it&apos;s just so charming. So impressed with the heaters on the covered patio. Although there&apos;s not many seats outside, I was lucky to snag one right when they opened at 11 AM. As expected, my breakfast was amazing. I had the eggs Benedict with spinach and avocado minus the English muffin. Because I&apos;m gluten-free I had some special request which they were more than happy to accommodate. My dining companion had the breakfast quesadilla which I really wanted, but because of flour tortillas wasn&apos;t able to get. She was really impressed with the meal as it was her first time visiting cactus.","Highly Recommend ! Chile Relleno was excellent, large Poblano filled with cheese and a delicious mole sauces. Spicy Caesar salad with grilled shrimp was awesome. Large portions, excellent service and COVID precautions are exceptional.","We got the shrimp diablo appetizer, Austin-style guacamole, and steak fajitas to share for two, and it was plenty.  The shrimp had the crunchiest fried batter, I loved it!  Sauce with a little kick and a nice slaw alongside.  The other sauce on the side (mango?) was a little weird and too sweet for me.  
I probably should have known that queso would be tough for takeout, so the Austin-style guac that&apos;s covered in queso fell a little short.  It was congealed and not super flavorful.  :( I prefer it in Austin! Haha.  I will say the chips were above-average restaurant tortilla chips. 
The fajitas were overall great!  The steak was super tender; in terms of the meat alone this dish was a good value.  It came with yummy caramelized onions, cheese, pico de gallo, lettuce, sour cream, and guac.  I wished there were bell peppers as well like many fajitas.  I expected a little bit better quality lettuce and tomatoes though, the lettuce was already browning.  
All in all we liked Cactus a lot and I know we&apos;ll be back, just not ordering queso for takeout, haha.","I can say, with certainty, that Cactus has the best steak salad I&apos;ve been able to plunge my fork into, in the Seattle area. It&apos;s a big bowl with big flavor, and I find myself ordering it again and again. This restaurant, the staff, and the cocktails are inviting, bright and colorful. I would recommend the tequila pina-colada, the fresh coconut wins me over every time. Also, the drinks taste better when you sit on their patio, I&apos;m not sure if this has been scientifically proven yet. 
The Spanish rice is the only reason I didn&apos;t give this place 5 stars - whoever is responsible for that recipe needs a smack in the face from my Mexican mother.",Everything was delicious and packaged perfectly! Exactly the experience we were hoping for. Guacamole and spicy beef tamale were particularly amazing! A big thank you to the restaurant staff for keeping this great place open.,"My wife and I were looking to mix it up for delivery and came across Cactus. Cactus has such a good reputation for their in person dining experience that we try to see how it translates to delivery. I had the chicken chimichanga and my wife had the Grilled Skirt Steak Fajitas. 

For me, the chimichangas was delicious. I typically order shrimp chimichangas when at other places but it wasn&apos;t an option that I could see here. The chicken was good so I have no complaints. 

My wife enjoyed her the fajitas and especially noted the house made tortillas as being exceptional.

Really, if you are basing it on food alone, it&apos;s a 5 star experience. If you are considering the entire experience including delivery times then it&apos;s a 4 star experience. The difference being that by time the food arrived, it was lukewarm and I really enjoy that &quot;right out of the kitchen&quot; taste/experience. But the risk of lukewarm food comes with any delivery service, especially ones that have multiple stops. 

Do I recommend Cactus? Absolutely. Give it a whirl and once you&apos;re able to have a traditional dining experience, we will be there for sure.","I&apos;ve had many delicious meals at all of the Cactus locations. The butternut squash enchiladas are my favorite dish on the menu, and they pair perfectly with a house margarita. 

They have a great set up at the Madison location for pick up during this pandemic... you&apos;ll get a text when your order is ready, then walk in one door to grab your clearly labeled bag of food before leaving through another door. It&apos;s not the same as eating in their festive restaurant, but the food tastes the same!","I usually like Cactus. I&apos;ve been there to dine in and take out. This time I ordered nachos to go. These were not good nachos. It appeared that the cops were thrown into the to go box, and cheese was melted in the box as well. There was more cheese than chips, and the cheese was hardened to the box. The toppings weren&apos;t scarce, but again there was no balance in toppings/cheese/chips. There was an odd taste that I experienced with some but couldn&apos;t put my finger on it. I paid $19 for nachos with chicken, and i I could not even finish it.

Do not order nachos to go from this Cactus.","I usually don&apos;t care for this place but my family loves coming here... I ordered the shrimp salad  which was  very light and refreshing. The shrimp was flavored really well and on the menu it said it came with kale but it was a lighter leaf instead. I thought it paired better than kale would&apos;ve. The fruit and avocado in my salad added some fresh texture.


Tried the Mexican mule and it was very delicious! Great proportions...

They also provide chips and salsa. The salsa is very spicy though so be prepared!!! The guacamole was very creamy. I liked it.","This was my first time at this Cactus location. Absolutely beautiful location, first of all. It&apos;s so close to the water, so when we were told there was a bit of a wait time that was no problem; we just walked around outside a bit. As far as scenery goes, this location has the other few beat in my opinion. The food is consistent between here and the other two Cactus restaurants I&apos;ve been to. I got the enchiladas and was amazed (as usual). We also got an order of the guac to split. For someone who doesn&apos;t normally like guacamole, I must say I was fairly impressed. My boyfriend also enjoyed his food. 
My personal favorite things to order here are the chile relleno and the queso- SO GOOD. We didn&apos;t order that this time, but next time I&apos;ll probably stick to what I know. 
The service was just decent, which is my reasoning for taking (only one) star off. It didn&apos;t blow my mind or anything. They were pretty busy, which I am very understanding of as someone who has been a server myself, but it still took quite a while to get our bill at the end.
The Bellevue location is just a little nicer and for the price, I think a little more worth going to in my
opinion. But I still can&apos;t really complain much and can definitely see myself returning to the Madison Park Cactus!",We experience blatant racist unprovoked remarks and aggression by other cactus customers. While dining at the Madison park location two white drunk women in their 50s walked up to our table unprovoked and shouted inches from my face without a mask &quot;we are not racist but scare of you&quot; repeatedly. The busser mentioned that they were regulars to which the manager said he doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s taking about defending the actions of the two women. I am half Chinese and my friend is black. The manager offered us ice cream &quot;to&quot;make us happy&quot;. Before this experience I really enjoyed going to cactus but on fortunately I don&apos;t think that my friend or family will be comfortable spending  money at this establishment since the regulars are scared of us.,My friend recommended this restaurant since she has been many times.  Parking was a little busy but it&apos;s close to water/park a hip and happening area of madison park.  Friendly accommodating seating.  I wasn&apos;t feeling my best but i had a steak salad.  That was so tasty!  My friend had allergies and they accommodated her meal prep with those allergies in mind.  Needless to say I will be back again:),I was finishing dinner when Rickie request my friend and I to leave because we were at the table outside too long. The table across from us had been there about the same amount of time. We had just spent 100.00 on dinner. I am a local and go to this restaurant frequently. Disappointed . This will no longer exists our first choice.,"Fajitas are amazing  excellent customer service :) 
It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve found a good Mexican restaurant","Our family loves Cactus and it&apos;s our daughter&apos;s favorite restaurant! We always have a perfect meal and they accommodate special requests (i.e. no agave in the Mamacita margarita, lettuce cups vs tortillas, etc). The jalape√±o poppers are killer. I love the &quot;live wait&quot; feature and it helps us always get a seat without waiting long, if at all. We go a couple times a month and have never had a bad experience!","This isn&apos;t, by any stretch of the imagination, Mexican food.... Indeed, I&apos;m not quite certain what it is.

Yesterday, by happenstance, I ended up there with a friend because a neighboring restaurant was unexpectedly closed. I ordered a &quot;casa salad&quot; (first hint that it isn&apos;t Mexican) and the chile relleno.  The salad was drowning in a greasy, vinegar-acidic dressing and I set it aside.  Then the &quot;chile relleno&quot; arrived.  I think that they must have sent it out to a Japanese restaurant to be cooked, because it had been coated with rice flour and deep-fried, i.e. tempura-ed. Worse yet, it was surrounded by a cloyingly sweet sauce that they had described on the menu as &quot;mole&quot;.  Holey mole!  It was not.

And there wasn&apos;t a Mexican in sight.....that should have been the tip-off.","the biggest problem I had was the number of choices that sounded amazing.  Went for brunch with our son and his family to celebrate his birthday.  When I walked in with his gift the server asked if there was a birthday and who&apos;s was it so of course I told him.

It was early and none of us wanted alcohol but Oh would I like to go back and try some of their specialty cocktails.  We ordered chips and salsa for the table and some fry bread.  The chips were amazing, the fry bread just a bit soggy but you can&apos;t go wrong with fried dough.

Most ordered different things and shared small bites since no one wanted to give up their food.  My son had potato tacos that had just the right amount of spice and were yummy.  Hubs had a chimichanga with chorizo which he said was great but thought his black beans a bit spicy.  Two of us had the chili rellanos, different from any I&apos;d had before but still tasty.  Thought a bit too much batter but the ancho sauce was a nice touch.

At the end of the meal the server brought my son a flan with a candle and so we all shared.  Very nice.  Wish we lived closer but Tacoma is a bit far to go except for special occasions.","I&apos;ve been here twice in the last month for a work meeting/lunch and I was impressed by the quality of customer service both times. A few colleagues and I stopped in for happy hour today before our afternoon meeting and we told our waitress we were in a rush. Drinks and food were served quickly so we were super happy. Our waitress also checked on us multiple times during our quick 30-minute happy hour break that it made it so easy for us to get in, have a drink, and get out without while maintaining superb service. Not all Cactus restaurants have such great customer service, but this location definitely does.","We just went for our first meal out since March. We&apos;ve been Cactus fans for a long time, and chose this both because we love the food (and drinks) and because they have outdoor seating plus a detailed description on their website of steps they&apos;ve taken to make the experience safe. Even though I&apos;m just out of radiation therapy and very careful, I felt safe there. The food is amazing. I&apos;m just glad I couldn&apos;t get through it all because I have something to look forward to. Servers are extremely professional and friendly. Overall, a terrific experience. The food!","We love this area of North Seattle and stopped by for a late lunch before a masked trunk or treat with friends. We wanted to sit outside and ended up waiting a bit for an opening-it was a sunny Saturday so we were happy to wait. 

Once seated, I got the bartender&apos;s margarita which was SO yummy. We enjoyed munching on chips and salsa ($3) while we waited for lunch. 

I got the carnitas chimichanga and it was delicious. The pork carnitas was flavorful and a little smoky and the beans that came with it on the side were great too! 

Some of the outdoor seating didn&apos;t allow for 6 feet between different tables (so we just sat farthest away from those tables) and our wait time to order and get our drinks and food was longer than the 2 other tables that were seated about the same time as us. Otherwise it&apos;s a fun and delicious place to go if you&apos;re in the area and want sit down Mexican!",Fabulous outdoor seating now with probably the best heaters in town and nice clear sidewalls,the mock steak is important to me on an emotional level. so many vegan places are history after covid. grateful this option still stands,"We really like this place. My fianc√© loves their Beer Battered Fish Tacos. Says they&apos;re well cooked, the sauce it great and the tacos are not too busy with too many fillings. 
I tried their chimichanga with mock chicken and red sauce and really liked it. The mock chicken was juicy and added to the flavor of the filling. 
And our friend couldn&apos;t get enough of the hot chocolate! They also have a good bear selection. Definitely wanna try their margaritas next time!","Overall, pretty good experience.  
Service was great and the food was really good.  
I had the street tacos and my wife and daughter had burritos.","Ah...Maze...Ing! This is what Mexican food is supposed to taste like! Moving to the PNW, from California, means a never ending search for AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD! El Chupacabra is like hitting the JACKPOT! Keep being awesome!",Awful food and drink.  The carne asada has no flavor. The margheritas are watered down salty mess.,"Absolute must try. 
I&apos;m usually never 100% satisfied with wet burritos that I order from other restaurants...but this place absolutely changed that. The meat was tender and they give you the right amount of sauce (what&apos;s even greater is that you can have both red and green). Definitely a place you won&apos;t forget flavor-wise.","This place is always busy + parking is a pain. That said, the food is good and I like the options for vegan cheese + GF dining for our friends. 

Our first visit we went for lunch. He ordered beer battered fish tacos with cabbage, homemade white sauce, and pico. I opted for the pozole. The soup was excellent and full of pork, hominy, celery, carrots, onion, and slices of avocado. 

Tacos come three to an order and you can order a single if you prefer. My companion was still hungry after his three so he ordered an extra one with carnitas!

My second visit was with a friend who went with their veggie tacos. She said they were delicious - packed with veg (lettuce, whole pinto beans, onions, avocado slices, and black olives) plus rice.

They have a variety of meat and non-meat options: carne asada, chicken verde (green sauce),  chicken tinga (slow simmered in red sauce with and roasted tomatoes, carnitas, al pastor, plus fake meats from Morningstar and Gardein.

Items marked with initials can be made vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free. Daiya vegan cheese can be substituted for an up-charge on certain dishes.

Our server told us that we could buy salsa to take home. I nearly did because that chipotle, garlic, and pineapple salsa is addictive!","Amazing flavors! I got their mission style burrito half and half wet with pork carnitas, so impressed! I&apos;ll definitely be returning. And their salsas that come with the burrito are magnificent!",There are better Mexican places around. What i love about el chupacabra is that it is across the street from ridgewood bottle and tap. Ill grab some tacos and then head to ridgewood to enjoy a frose or beer slushi outside on a sunny day. Perfect excursion.,"Turns out if you sit at the bar (as long as it&apos;s just 1-2 people), you&apos;ll have a better experience here. I still can&apos;t stand the layout of this restaurant, so when we saw how crowded the place was - both inside and out, we were discouraged we would end up seated in one of the dreaded tables  near the pillars, so we took our names off the list and sat at the bar instead. We for sure knew we wouldn&apos;t be able to get one of the booth tables, and the empty bar seemed like the next best option, since I was so hungry and just wanted to eat.

The bartender was attentive the entire time we were there, unlike the service we got in the past sitting near the pillars. Again, our chips arrived AFTER the tacos, which is so strange to me. The bartender must have noticed because she gave us guacamole with our chips and salsa when they finally arrived. That boosted my rating by up to 2 stars.

The tacos themselves were lacking in flavors. I got one red chicken and one green chicken, when apparently I&apos;m not supposed to order different kinds, but the bartender was nice enough to put in the mixed order. I had to dump a lot of the guacamole and squirt bottle sauces on the tacos. Thank goodness for those being available.","We ordered several dishes from the restaurant to be delivered, including a single enchilada made with Morning Star cake meat, as one of us is a vegetarian. 

The enchilada was very disappointing-- literally a frozen Morning Star sausage patty cut up and plopped into a tortilla. We don&apos;t hate Morning Star; they have some great options for meat replacement, but this use coming from a restaurant at the price point advertised was very strange. 

The chimichanga was fine, and the beer battered fish tacos were okay, too, but overall very underwhelmed by the whole experience. 

Still pining for decent Mexican food in Seattle. This did not cut it.","Good old chuppie,
Is it amazing, is it going to blow your mind and send you soaring on some sort of magical food journey?  No, but it&apos;s solid. 

Let me be clear, you want the wet burrito, everything else on the menu doesn&apos;t matter, the wet burrito is king, it is a heavy sloppy mess of glory that will lull you into a food coma. It is pure hung over bliss.  Everything else ive tried on the menu has been pretty underwhelming but the Carne Asada wet burrito hits the spot.","This place was small, vibe-y, and I think I&apos;d prefer it at night or in the summer because it got stuffy inside and there were tons of families with kids, which made it a bit loud and messy.

Pros?
Huge burritos 
Decent pricing 
Variety of beers on tap
Tasty margaritas 
Friendly service
Vegan options for those who desire 

Cons?
Service was a bit aloof 
Definitely not enough bathrooms for this place
Hot and cramped","This place is fabulous and one of my go to places for vegan Mexican options locally. I&apos;ve been to all the locations and am very sad about the closure of the Lake Union one. This location is closest to my house, but can present parking challenges and unfortunately I love many other food options in this neighborhood. The patio here is great for a nice sunny day, but because of this it may get crowded. The inside has a very cool vibe, but can feel a bit loud and cramped. I always forget that I should add this in to my brunch rotation. There is a twice daily happy hour. 

I love this place because it is especially great for me with a plethora of items that can be easily veganized. They have 4 different fake meat options (3 vegan), but I usually alternate between the mock green and red chicken. I love that they aren&apos;t skimping on the amount provided and that the fake meat does not come with an additional charge on most menu items. Do be warned there is a fee to add non dairy cheese or sour cream (tofutti). Of course you can get vegetarian Mexican food at a ton of places, but i&apos;s really nice to feel like you aren&apos;t having to miss out on anything with being able to enjoy meat, cheese and sour cream. The guacamole is delicious and my current favorite menu item is the chimichanga. Chips and salsa are an additional fee, but there are 3 delicious taco sauces you can sample to spice up your food free of charge. 

My non veg partner always enjoys his food as well. They always seem happy to make accommodations as requested. Service is attentive and there is a full bar.",I dream about how delicious El Chupacabra&apos;s chimichangas and salsas are. Love this place!,"Came here with my twentish daughter. It seemed like a hipster place and she loves these kind of places. Came here for dinner. The place was not full at all, but we were seated at a table right by the door and next to a pillar. Side note: I have found there are several dining types of people one eats with, one of those being the kind that will not notify the server if anything is wrong out of embarrassment. Plus, they will request their dining companion not to mention anything that is wrong with their order. Gave me a wrong order? Forgot my sides? All forbidden for me to correct my waiter. So going out to eat with my daughter is a crap shoot, if something is wrong I just have to put up with it.
Now unfortunately, our waiter must have been new to both his profession and the restaurant. He did qualify as being young and hipsterish. Sadly, he knew very little about the menu. He was easily confused by taking our orders and had to go ask other people for any questions we had about the menu. Ordered drinks, with arrived  20 minutes later.   He brought the wrong drinks for us. My daughter&apos;s Margarita was undrinkable, based on the large amount of mixer. My wine was wrong, but I drank it anyway.
The next wait was half hour for our food. My daughter was starving, so ordered the guacamole to tide her over. Not bad guacamole, but stale chips.
Burritos arrive and they just aren&apos;t very good. My order again was wrong beef instead of chicken. Waiter appears very confused at who should get which plate. He actually is so flustered he runs into the awful pillar at the side of the table while leaving. Now for the sake of not embarrassing my daughter, I do not laugh. But my fellow Yelpers, this actually was the highlight of my whole experience here. Never seen a pillar faceplant before in all of my dining experiences. He smacked that pillar pretty hard, felt really sorry for him. He is so overcome with embarrassment,  he hides for the remainder of our time here. 
We finish and have to ask someone else to find our server and our bill. He comes to our table, avoiding eye contact and with a conspicuous red mark above his cheekbone. I cannot make this up. I think it was about 80.00 for us both, two drinks, guacamole and two burritos.
Sadly, poor service and mediocre food. Extra star for seating us by the pillar and the resulting waiter faceplate.",Kitchen staff pulled their masks off while working in the kitchen cooking and plating to talk to the server a foot apart from them and acted like it was no big deal. They also left off the meat on one of my tostadas which didn&apos;t matter since we tossed all the food without eating it. This is how we get COVID hotspots.,"The food was not very flavor able. I had a pork enchilada and my partner had a burrito. Kids had rice and beans which they usually like. Everything was just blah, lacking flavor all around. The guacamole was good though.","I&apos;m not usually a big fan of Mexican food but loved this place. Not only do they say their Burritos are big--they actually are. And they are Reasonably priced.

Gorditos is not stingy either. The shrimp burrito was the best out of the three different burritos that we ordered, and it had plenty of large shrimp. Most places when you order anything seafood or shrimp related, only gives you a few puny shrimp.

During our takeout here we tried the pork smothered burrito, the shrimp smothered burrito, and the chicken baby burrito. The shrimp was by far the best but I am not sure if you can get it in the baby burrito size. doing fajita style is also worth the money. The only thing I wish they had would be a variety of customizations. I would love to be able to pick what kind of salsa is inside and have like a variety of different salsa flavors. Gorditos is definitely worth a try, even if Mexican food is not your favorite.","Delivery guests are missing out- for those fortunate to do the pick-up option, they reap the benefits of salsa bar access, where the awesome staff have already prepackaged cups of a half-dozen different options to try. Pro Tip: the dark red stuff is the absolute bomb with a hot and spicy smoky flavour. Onto the food- the creamy chipotle burrito is where it&apos;s at. I&apos;ve been told I have a big appetite and even tho this isn&apos;t the famous baby-sized burrito, I am splitting this hog in half and savin for later. Perfect blend of cream, chicken, mushroom, zucchini, and beans on a lightly toasted tortilla. Wash it down with the Jamaica red-hibiscus ice tea and you are set for life.","My favorite burrito place in Seattle! I love their spicy chicken fajita burrito and get it every time I come. They use super thick foil to wrap their dry burritos which really help the food retain its heat making it great take out! Be sure to visit their salsa bar for their homemade salsa, onions &amp; cilantro, and more!","Wet burrito was excellent, and huge portions. Service was super friendly. Salsa options were interesting but unmemorable. We also got a half-order of nachos, but that was a bit of a mistake. Perhaps it&apos;s because it was for pickup, but the chips were so soggy they became makeshift tortillas.

Anyway, happy to go back to satisfy my burrito cravings!","I&apos;ve lived in the neighborhood for several years and have finally been able to try the food. I am happy to say it was not just the food that was good but the customer service as well.

When I came into the restaurant I needed a Togo menu because I forgot my children&apos;s masks the allowed me to take one of there regular menus. My family was able to figure out what they wanted and when I came back in I was greeted by a very nice gentleman who had amazing humor and he was so patient with my bazillion item order.

The food came out fresh! By the time we got home it was still super hot and delicious! My boyfriend got a grande wet burrito. While in the restaurant I hadn&apos;t noticed all of the pictures of baby&apos;s being compared to the size of burritos. The burrito was massive! I&apos;m honestly surprised my boyfriend was able to finish it. The carne asada plate was seasoned very well and the ceviche tasted amazing. My children enjoyed there tacos and quesadilla, which also were pretty large. My kids approved everything about there food.

I really appreciated that the establishment did a lot of things right in front of you and items were made fresh. I also noticed that the gentleman who helped me had a real connection with the customers that came in and appeared to be regulars. This is the type of business that I truly enjoy and appreciate.","This is seriously one of my favorite burrito places in Seattle if you&apos;re looking for a place you have to eat it with a fork and knife. They have the baby burrito which is  quite literally the size of a baby. They have fresh juices, salsas, and cold beer. Instead of giving you an order number they give you a llama with his name attached which is awesome and unique. Highly recommend!!","Come get your baby burritossssss. This big boy measures up to the size of your forearm! No frills, just a BIG A** BURRITO with all the fixings! 

Solid burrito but for its size, it really needs to have more one extra tortilla to keep its structural integrity. 2 bites into the burrito this baby already started falling apart and it made the meal extremely messy. Also had no idea the burrito even had any sour cream or guacamole (to the point where I was stealing sour cream from the nachos to put it on the burrito) until.... I got to the final quarter of the burrito and it was filled with it. 

Also not sure where the salsa was? I&apos;ve only been here once for takeout in times of COVID so I don&apos;t know how they were dealing out salsa before but we didn&apos;t get any with our take out :( 

Would give this place another go if I was in the area.","Not the highest quality burrito you&apos;ll have but the selections, portions, and price are A+. The salsas from the salsa bar are BOMB. We ordered the grande fish burrito ($13.50). Tilapia, Iceberg Lettuce, sour cream, black beans, rice, and Guacamole (tasted packaged - I like packaged guac so I didn&apos;t mind but the BF wasn&apos;t a fan).

The guy at the cash register was so friendly :) Burritos came out quickly too!","Updating previous review as I was sure I had over rated the fantastic flavor in my memory (imagination). At least I thought I had written a review, maybe I only posted pictures? The Fajita Burrito was absolutely as mouth wateringly delicious as I remembered and I could still only eat half in one sitting. However, the second half reheated by baking in my oven, was even more taste bud pleasing then the first, wow! I can&apos;t wait til the Pandemic is behind us when I can dine in, instead of struggling to not get the savory juices of the Fajita all over me eating in the car in the parking lot.  Guys this food is so good!","Ordered tacos .Good food and nice service, the salsa could be more tasty than it is. Will visit again to try more food.",I&apos;m a Seattle native living here my whole life not your average typical guy. I&apos;ve traveled throughout the US and have ate numerous amount of burritos. This place is more of a fast food paste business with a long standing heritage in the greenwood neighborhood. I remember the days in the early 90s as a preteen bowling at Lonnie Lanes in greenwood which no longer exists thanks to progressive liberals. It&apos;d be better to build non-affordable housing to move people of color outside of the city of Seattle. Had a plane chicken burrito that was 5/10 and the potato burrito needs to be taken off the menu. the amount that they Jew you on sour cream is laugh even when they water it down from their commercial size sour cream container. people that are giving this four and five stars have never had a real f****** burrito.,"LISTEN. UP. If you&apos;re not from Washington, you may not be aware that authentic Mexican food is so hard to find around here. I had lunch plans with someone from southern California who claimed that this was their go-to place for Mexican food.

LOCATION &amp; PARKING //
This place is in Greenwood near some grocery stores and other local shops. If you&apos;re having a hard time finding it, find the hot pink wall. There&apos;s a small parking lot behind the restaurant but I ended up finding street parking a block away easily too. I wouldn&apos;t worry too much about finding parking around here, especially if you don&apos;t mind walking a block or two.

FOOD //
I got the CARNE ASADA QUESADILLA and a side of GUACAMOLE. The portions are huge here! The quesadilla was amazing though. It was a perfect blend of the textures of crispiness and softness. It wasn&apos;t salty nor bland. What I appreciated the most is that it never got soggy throughout my entire meal. I hate when cheese seeps through my quesadilla and makes everything too soft. Also, this place&apos;s chips and salsa? BOMB. I loved everything here. I also go the STRAWBERRY AGUA FRESCA which was super refreshing and perfect for the meal! Be prepared for a food coma afterwards.

SERVICE //
We were treated with such kindness immediately! You can tell that this place runs in a very family-like style. The restaurant itself is clean too.

AMBIANCE //
Honestly, when I walked into here, I felt like I was in Santa Ana, CA again. It all just felt right and I knew the food was going to be fantastic. It&apos;s a casual place where families or friends can grab a reliable delicious Mexican meal together. 

OVERALL // 4.5 stars
I&apos;ve already recommended this place to others and they&apos;ve shared with me that they love it! I&apos;ll be back.","I came from California so I have a pretty high standard for Burrito. Anyway, let&apos;s sum it up!


5 star for the vibe and customer service. The lady at the cashier is seemingly nice and friendly. Typical mexican foodhouse where everyone welcomes you with warm smile and &quot;family atmosphere&quot;.

4 stars for the taste, I find it a little less than what I was craving for. It lacks the zest of lime, salt and herbs. I find it a little bland for my taste. I would love if the onions come with Burrito and not just a condiment. They can improve by encorporating it on the Burrito right away and ask each customer if they opt to take it out. But my husband loves their flavor so I guess this part is still debatable. 

5 star for the price. $8.81 with tax for a regular-sized Burrito. Fairly priced.

5 star for accessibility and parking.",The steak fajita burrito grande - dinner for two days and glad of it! My mouth was totally drooling for more after the first night!,"Holy crap this was mind blowing. Fresh corn tortilla chips, the freshest of the fresh ingredients for the burritos. My husband said 100% make it a wet burrito. Carne Asada and chicken were both killer. Only takeout right now, but the service was so quick. Staff was also beyond nice, and willing to explain everything to us!","This is a solid bet for great Mexican food. Gorditos has been here forever - I&apos;ve been coming here since high school - and offers quality burritos. They have other dishes of course, but I mostly come for the burritos. I lived many years in California and to be honest, hardly eat Mexican food in Seattle. But when I do, Gorditos is my spot: it&apos;s close by, flavorful, service is great. I am especially a fan of the chipotle salsa, it&apos;s the right level of spice and the ideal complement for a veggie burrito. 

Tip: get a burrito, drive to nearby Carkeek Park, hike to the orchard find a spot under the old apple trees for a socially distanced picnic. This is going to be a summer evening tradition from now until it gets too soggy to sit on the ground.","Gorditos touts itself as healthy Mexican food and I wondered what to expect when I grew up around greasy 24 hour taco shops in Arizona.  Health isn&apos;t really something I think of first at 2am after clubbing and the hanger sets in.  So I guess this worked out since it was around 4 in the afternoon on a Sunday in Greenwood.  I got the creamy chipotle chicken keto style, they offer a lot of options keto style where they skip the rice and beans.  A friend got fajitas, and we grabbed the green sauce, grabbed our to go order and headed to a nearby park.  The place looks way smaller in person than on the site but maybe that&apos;s just camera angles and they removed all but one table?  I get there are limits due to covid right now.  Despite ordering Hi-lo (keto) there was still a lot of rice in my container.  The creamy chipotle chicken tasted fine, but there were other options on the menu I might have enjoyed more.","They are not kidding
These burritos are GRANDE
And so freakin&apos; good.

Gordito&apos;s totally lives up to the hype. Much has been said about the size of the burritos (absurd, colossal), but they are really delicious. 

My recos:
- Fish burrito is stellar. Duh, get it wet - it will come soused in tasty salsa verde. They&apos;re generous with the protein (and all fillings, honestly), and the grande should cover 3 meals easily.
- Quesadillas are a must. I was skeptical. A tortilla with cheese? I can make that at home, pass. BUT GET IT. Gordito&apos;s quesadillas are salty, garlicky perfection and you will love them.
- During COVID, they&apos;re doing takeout sangria in adorable little mason jars with itty bitty handles. Yes, you need several.

Worth the wait, totally 100% worth going and supporting them during the pandemic. Gordito&apos;s rocks!","I&apos;ve always drove past this place seeing their baby-sized burrito advertisement and thought &quot;perfect, I never finish my burritos and a mini one sounds great!&quot; I was so wrong. It was the opposite. Upon coming into the restaurant you can see their walls are filled with photos of their burritos aside BABIES like infant children. They in fact serve infant sized burritos. So beware lol but otherwise the staff was very friendly and the burrito was delicious (shared with my partner). Stop by and check them out!","Love, love, love this place.  I&apos;ve been going here for over 15 years and it never disappoints.  The grande burrito continues to be a great value and delicious.  The nachos are really tasty, too.","I liked this Chipotle. The food was a little underseasoned, but I really have no strong complaints","This is the worst chipotle I have ever been to, they cheap out on ingredients and they give you a burrito that is not feeling at all, the lady making my burrito dropped the meet and she was so stingy about grabbing meet that I felt were like she was scaling gold and I felt guilty about eating it!!!

This was the worst burrito I ever had in my life and it was so small that I think it should have been called a taquito instead of a burrito. I will never return to this location.","Huge thank you to Wesley for helping me out, I ordered my food through mobile order and was in a rush to get there and ended up getting there 6 mins past my scheduled order. Found out some terrible being had took my order and walked out the door, Wesley definitely made me feel valued as a customer and quickly rushed to pack my missing order.Definitely enjoyed my food and for sure will come back to this Uvill location for this kind of service!","This location was super clean and although it was busy, we were able to get in and out very quickly. Food was good and employees were very fast! The outdoor tables are still open here, and the drink fountain is still self serve.",I have never seen a chipotle care less about online orders in my life. Whoever makes the online orders should be fired this bowl is the smallest thing I have ever seen and this is not the first time this has happened,"Normally I don&apos;t post reviews for fast food restaurants, but this Chipotle had excellent service and better food than I&apos;ve had at other Chipotles; I&apos;ve learned that the food quality and consistency varies across the different franchises.

I needed a post-workout meal, so I got a chicken salad with brown rice, veggies, mild/medium and corn salsas, a dab of sour cream, and guacamole. Even though it was dinner rush hour, the servers made sure I got in and out of the restaurant in less than ten minutes. Also, shoutout to the server who gave me my money&apos;s worth of guacamole! Definitely worth paying the extra $2.25!

Parking at uville during meal hours is limited, so I suggest parking in the parking structure rather than near QFC or in the ground level.

Overall: 4/5 food, 4/5 service","Had no problems for a long time, but the past 4 or so times I&apos;ve ordered there&apos;s been issues with online ordering. I&apos;m at the point where I&apos;m never ordering from this chipotle again because of the service. Constantly missing entire burritos or bowls from the order which means sharing or someone figures out dinner for themselves. The past two orders have had hair in the bowls as well, so clearly not much attention to detail at this particular location. Love the food but I can&apos;t imagine 8 pm on a Tuesday night is dinner rush- how do you forget a whole meal?","Chipotle never disappoints me! Just remember to always get chips and queso, because it&apos;s soooooo full of flavor and so crunchy. Almost rated it as 5stars, but they forgot to deliver my izze juice. Called the restaurant immediately and got it delivered after 5 mins. Yummy as ever!",Yes I&apos;m a dork I forgot to take pictures but their food is always fresh healthy and delicious and the people behind the counter we&apos;re very nice the location was very easy to get to I would suggest a chipotle Mexican Grill anytime you&apos;re hungry for a healthy fresh Mex burrito nachos taco salad,"Idk how one restaurant can be so consistently awful LMAO. I knew my burrito was kind of fat so I went double tortilla mode to help mitigate the inevitable damage this Chipotle would undoubtedly cause, yet it was wrapped so poorly that no amount of tortillas could have prevented the outside from being thoroughly soaked by barbacoa juice. The joke is truly on me for continuing to order from here.",We ordered our chipotle to the wrong chipotle and they were very understanding and gave us a free order,"Due to the service I received at this location is one of two reasons why I am giving the one star. 

First reason: I did a pick up order, arrived 3 minutes before estimated pick up time, no problem at that part. Chipotles that I have been to all have the online pick up shelves where you just look for your name and grab your order. I waited 15-20 more minutes because they were busy but not extremely. I then was finally approached by the cashier ( young girl ), asked if I was picking up an order. She then proceeds to tell me they no longer put orders out due to theft. Totally understandable, but why was there no note/sign left so customers will know when they arrive?? Maybe she was having a bad day because her demeanor was very rude and she spoke to me as if I was incompetent as if I was suppose to already know this information (she seen me when I entered, no greet from no one). 


Second reason: 

My order was a burrito bowl and a burrito. I honestly wish I had taken a picture of the amount of protein that was on the burrito and burrito bowl! There was barely any! How cheap! 


I&apos;ll just stick to the lake city and Northgate location from now on. Even the u-district location does better and they get super busy.","The convenience and the variety is why like to go here. Oh and the price is right also. Since this Chipotle is located at the University it was packed and the servers tried to complete every order in a timely manner.

You choice what item you want and what you want in it. Most times I have an idea of what I want but didn&apos;t realize you can do a combination of meats in your order. But I stuck to one and loaded it with brown rice, black beans and veggies.

I got the mild sauce this time wasn&apos;t sure if I wanted the hot one. If you want a quick meal that will satisfy your cravings this is the place it&apos;s plentiful and good.  Don&apos;t be discouraged about the long line it flows rather quickly.  For the price it&apos;s just right for what you get. But I would come here again in a heart beat. Enjoy! You will not be disappointed!",I eat at Chipotle&apos;s a lot.  Good clean food. This location is slammed and every single table was filthy.  I asked them to clean the tables so people could sit and eat and the attempt they made was lackluster at best.  I should have just wiped it down myself.  D- for cleanliness - something so easy to do.  Many people would skip this place if cleanliness is important to you.  Gross!,"frustrated! ordered a sofritas vegan bowl. eat 80% through it when i chewed into something rather big and fiberous.... ya it was a piece of meat (i think steak). as someone who choices not to eat meat i was shocked, upset, and uncomfortable. i understand accidents happen, but it is still worth bringing up. luckily i am not allergic or have religious believes about meat. (i didnt bother with a photo cause its half chewed food, no body wanna see that)",There was guacamole and lettuce in the section for mobile order but I was ordering there. They refused to give me it even tho it was right in front of them. My meal is dry now and they could&apos;ve given it to me. They don&apos;t give the customer what they want.,Your best option for road food on the drive from Denver when you are getting hangry! My friend and I had issues renting our car and didn&apos;t end up leaving the airport area until super late - grouchy and hungry we set out on our adventure that is I-70. Not long after we got on the road we realized we needed some sustenance. Chipotle to the rescue! The best option for someone driving and not wanting to make a huge mess!,"Normally, I am a big fan of Chipotle, but lately, not so much. The last few times I have ordered to go the order is all goofed up. This time I was told there was no guacamole available. How do you run out of something so basic in middle of a lunch hour? It&apos;s too bad because I normally look forward to their food.","Not all that impressed with this location. The wait was not all long. I did find it awkward to see many employees cooking behind the line but only two serving customers. 

The cafe was dirty and lots of trash on the floor. The men&apos;s room was very dirty.","On the menu it says to let the staff know of any food allergies. I let one of the servers know I need to be sure to go gluten free with my burrito bowl. He said, &quot;Everything is gluten free including our flour tortillas.&quot; Looks like Chipotle needs to educate their staff... especially when it means someone can get really sick. Fail.","Yum. Yummy. Yummmmers!! A neighbor recommended this place so when I was in the neighborhood I put in an order! I&apos;m so glad I did - this family owned restaurant makes some really delicious and authentic mexican food. I loved that the tamale I ordered came with toppings and I didn&apos;t have to deal with the corn husk. The camarones a la diabla were pretty spicy despite indicating I wanted the mild option - but it didn&apos;t detract from the overall flavor of the dish. The beans and rice were so savory I ate every bite (normally I don&apos;t care for these sides!) This is telling. 

If I had one complaint it is that I wish their entrance wasn&apos;t facing the busy street as it is a long walk from the parking lot to the front side of the business. I was impressed to see all three of their kids sitting at separate tables all tending to themselves and not racing around or causing any trouble. I will definitely order takeout from them again the next time I&apos;m craving Mexican food!","ATTENTION: I Went to Senor Villas Today They have the Best Tacos..I had Carnitas tacos and Yum Yum  The service is Outstanding. Please Support Senor Villas. You will get a Great Hot Meal at a Reasonable Price...And they could really use the Business during this OutBreak...Senor Villas is Open for Takeout...Place an order for Pick Up (206) 517-5660 Best Mexican Food in town...Also, Senor Villa is having a &quot;Special Of The Week&quot; A Chimichanga Combo with Rice And Beans   for only $10 plus Complimentary Chips and Salsa...Enjoy!!!","My wife and I just finished a fine take-out meal, provided by Senor Villa.  This is our second visit to SV in the past 30 days and all of the meals were outstanding.   It was obvious that all main dishes and sides were made from scratch.  

The Cochinita Pibil, a specialized dish consisting of braised, marinated pork, cooked in a banana leaf, with unusual spices) was sensational and the other dishes that we have had were delicious and unique in some way.  

This restaurant used to be called Mr. Villa and the fare was unremarkable.  We stopped going  We now understand that Senor Villa is under new management and it shows.  You should give it a try.  You&apos;ll be glad you did. .","So perfect for someone like me who misses simple street tacos from Los Angeles. 

Updating to say this place consistently just hits the spot-simple great Mexican food that won&apos;t give you a stomach ache afterwards. Been ordering from them 2x a week for the last month and it&apos;s just what you need every time.","Their food is good, but the last time we ordered with them through Doordash, we were missing two items. I don&apos;t know if this was the restaurant&apos;s fault or the Doordash guy&apos;s--Doordash, as per usual, is being shady--but it kind of sucks to think you&apos;ll have 1 entree per person and then end up splitting one of them between two people. (The second missing item was a drink.)",First of all let me start by saying how happy and impressed I am that they actually read my Uber eats order they gave me all of my sides individually they put no ice in my beverage like I asked completely amazing food presentation was great everything is super fresh my avocado is green like it should be everything was amazing this location is easy to find there is parking in the back the staff is friendly I even called ahead of time to answer my questions about ordering ahead of time I have been to this location several times before in the past but kudos for actually Reading my order and my special request I am so impressed,"I&apos;ve eaten here several times, and every time the food is really fresh.  I like the consistant quality, always know I&apos;m going to enjoy the meal. Both soft and hard tacos are available. Nothing is overcooked! My Enchilada Verdes today (see pic) are perfect! And I especially like the whole beans with rice.  The chips are crispy and the salsa is delicious.

The restaurant is clean, and the decor is festive. It looks like a small place from the outside but there are 14 tables, plenty of room (and parking). ...and plenty of beer, wine and spirits! ... there is usually just one waitress &quot;Diana&quot;, and she is very up-beat and professional... service is excellent.",I go here 2-3 times a week! Friendly staff and awesome chicken quesadillas in corn tortillas with veggies.,"One of our neighbors recommended this place for good mexican food, and we are so happy to have found it. Its a small unassuming place, but the food is all made from fresh from scratch.

We started with Chicken Taquito. It was so good, fresh tortilla, the chicken filling tasty, and the guacamole fresh. I would highly recommend it.

We the got Chicken Flautas, and Mojarra Frita. We loved both of our entrees. The Chicken Flautas were were so good, fresh tortilla&apos;s, delicious chicken, and fresh, guacamole again. The flautas are good, but very similar to chicken taquito we had. They are both good, but I would not recommend getting them both at the same meal.

Mojarra frita is something I haven&apos;t seen at any of the other mexican restaurants. A whole fish deep fried and served with rice and beans. So good.

We finished our meal with Flan. Again so delicious, such a great end to our meal.","Senor Villa is a high quality Mexican restaurant in North Seattle, where Mexican food isn&apos;t exactly a specialty. Some of the food is better than others, but the food is consistent, so it&apos;s a matter of finding what you like. 

I&apos;m quite fond of the Pancho Villa Burrito and the Chicken Taquitos are to die for. The price is good for the amount of food you get. The Salsa is a little watery, but has a nice kick.

Senor Villa definitely quenches my need for Mexican food.","Only one table occupied whee Ed n we walked in. We should have turned around at that point. Oh well. 

I told the server I was Vegan yet when she brought the fajita plate with rice, I asked if the rice was made with chicken stock or water and it was made with chicken stock. She replaced the rice with salad. Just lettuce and a few tomatoes. No dressing. 

The food was bland. Chips were probably store bought. 

My friend ordered steak fajita. The meat was pathetic! The price was not cheap! 

Service was sad. 

Would I go back? No!!!!




Would I go back?","Chill family-run neighborhood place with amazing food, cool decor, and kind thoughtful people. I&apos;ve been going there for years and it got 300% better when it went under new ownership a few years ago. When I pick up my to go orders it never takes too long, they clearly use high quality ingredients, and everything is prepared perfectly. I want to eat there for many years to come! I would add a picture of my beautiful chicken enchiladas Mexicanos but I ate them too fast.","We&apos;ve driven by a hundred times, and today&apos;s the day we stopped in.  It was right before 5:00 on a Tuesday and not another patron in sight. 

We were pressed for time, so didn&apos;t scour the menu too much and ordered one of our favorites - chorizo con huevos (chorizo with eggs).  It was standard fare. Nothing snazzy but definitely met expectations.

Another couple did come in as we were leaving and they ordered Grande margaritas. They were indeed HUGE!","I walked by this slightly dark and unassuming place before venturing in for dinner. I was seated immediately and served red, green and white corn chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and crispy and the salsa on the spicier side, with a bite that lingered. The place only had three taken tables but there appeared to be a problem with their computer system so ordering took a bit but nothing unreasonable. I ordered two tacos, a side of refried beans and guacamole. My food arrived quickly and was tasty. The carnitas were a little dry and had lots of spicy raw purple onion on top but had good flavor. The guacamole was fresh with chopped tomatoes and onion in it. It was delicious and very reasonably priced.","We really like this joint.  Hard to find good Mexican food after relocating here from TX, but Se√±or Villa hits the spot.  The street tacos and mole are super as are the fajitas.  Happy to see futebol on the screens as well.  We always feel so welcome here and love the staff.","This is my goto for mexican take out. I&apos;m obsessed. The portions are huge and reasonably priced. I highly recommend their mole sauce dishes. For dessert, do not skip the fried ice cream, it&apos;s HEAVENLY.",Good authentic Mexico City style tacos. Guacamole is great too. Ceviche tostada very salty though.,"This place rocks! I&apos;ve been coming here for the last few weeks since I moved to this neighborhood. The prices are great and the tacos are delicious. I never leave without a side of rice and beans either. The owners are so friendly. I can&apos;t wait to come here and sit down to enjoy the atmosphere when the pandemic is over. Get the grilled jalapenos, you won&apos;t regret it.",Cold refried beans next to blazing hot but tasteless rice. Cheese enchilada was cold and cheese not melted. Patron margarita tasted like cleaner. Chips and salsa was tasty. Food arrived before our drinks no understanding by Staff. We won&apos;t be back.,"Nice little spot serving up traditional Mexican dishes. I&apos;ve been very impressed with the service and food from this spot, however, some reviews might state the opposite, it seems like the former regime was not as diligent as the new owners. Knowing nothing from the new peeps, I can honestly say it&apos;s definitely improve from where it was before ( from what I hear )

Putting any negativity behind, rest assure this place will not disappoint. Usually I&apos;m served by Ana with a smile and extreme knowledge of the food. I&apos;d recommend this place to anyone at anytime. Swing by and try this place you won&apos;t be disappointed.","Taco Del Mar is very delish when you&apos;re hungry.  This particular location has very, very limited parking, only six or seven stalls that I saw, and turning in off Greenwood--if you have low front end clearance, GO SLOW, or you will hear that dreadful SSSCCCCRRRRAAAAAPE sound.
  I had the stuffed burrito with sour cream, and with the tater tots one will fill you up.  About $8 to $9 per person, day or night, very reasonable.
Just don&apos;t expect free sour cream or free guacamole.  You have to pay.
You can watch them along the build line while they make your food, allowing you to customize it your way.
MMM....making me hungry just thinking about it.
Recommended.
Not another Taco Del Mar within five miles of here, nearest one is northgate, and then, Lynnwood.  Not too many of them left.","Ordered my dinner here and the food was poor quality and cold. Not sure why they even bothered to fill my order. Don&apos;t waist your money at this restaurant, there are plenty more better quality food restaurants in the Greenwood neighborhood.","The food is excellent, there is a variety of options and ingredients 
Also a very good value","The owner was very rude and disrespectful assuming I was cheating on the punch cards and he was trying to argue with me infront of customers, poor customer service. News flash buddy, your not the only taco del mar that hands out punch cards, no longer a customer at taco del mar, Taco Bell is cheaper and better quality",Super friendly and the best location I&apos;ve been to.  Very clean and inviting environment.  Definitely recommend.,A very good restaurant fast food to visit .. owner friendly excellent hygiene.. love to visit,"I came in late on Saturday with a large group, in which I was first in line. I ordered 2 quesadillas and 4 tacos. Somehow I was charged $44!! When I tried to tell the lady working I did not order 4 quesadillas, she insisted many times that I did and wouldn&apos;t understand. I was definitely overcharged. On top of that, I had to wait 45mins in line while everyone else got their food. Very poor experience.",The owner Josh and the team there are super friendly. The service is always fast and the food is good.,"Oh. My. God.  Have you ordered anything from TDM recently? Well, I unfortunately did. I have been eating TDM burritos for 20 years and I have always LOVED them. Well, I ordered the exact same thing I do every single time, and for some reason my burritos came with a hideous creamy disgusting smoky (chipotle perhaps?) sauce---smothering the burrito. Couldn&apos;t even pick it up, it completely fell apart. Also, TDM has always been very generous with chicken and I literally had a hard time even finding any in my burrito. To make matters worse, when I called to inquire about this &quot;sauce&quot; they said they hadn&apos;t put anything like that on them, and said &quot;maybe it&apos;s the sour cream&quot;. Right....idiots, do you think I don&apos;t know what sour cream tastes like?  So disappointing!! Taco Del Mar--I will miss you :&apos;-(","How I heard of this place: One of our Baha&apos;i friends in Bellingham bought a franchise (or two) over ten years ago.

Type of cuisine: Fast Tex-Mex. Fast, fresh and fun.

Ambiance: Colorful and beach-like, with surf-boards, huts (at some tables) and sand shaped into fish on the walls. Very casual.

What I ordered: My friend and I were in the mood for a quick bite on our way to yoga and needed something fast and filling. Having filled two punch cards, each of us were entitled to $5 off of our next order. It being after five o&apos;clock in the afternoon, all platters were $5 so we took the happy hour special! I ordered a platter with one enchilada (chicken) and a taco (soft taco with ground beef, topped with lettuce and pico de gallo). My dining companion selected two ground beef tacos in his platter. Each meal came with rice, our choice of beans, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo and cheese.

What I loved: I love the spicy pico de gallo and the made-to-your-liking selections!

Why I loved it: It&apos;s fast, it&apos;s easy and compared to many fast food joints, it can be as healthy or unhealthy as you make it, since it&apos;s all made to order.

Cost: Low for a large meal at a fast-food joint ($5 for each platter dinner after 5:00 p.m.)",Was quite skeptical when I walked in. The order process is similar to Chipotle and price is quite comparable. Their chicken burrito with mango salsa was quite good!,"BEWARE:  An employee added $5 tip to my $18 food order (without my knowledge).  I found out when I got my bank statement 2 weeks later, and was able to check my receipt to confirm.  I called the manager to tell him what had happened and he wasn&apos;t surprised-- this has clearly happened before.  I like the food but I won&apos;t be going back, that was just too low.",This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch.  The food is always great and the customer service is even better!  Josh (the owner) is a natural at running a restaurant.  Would definitely recommend this place!,I go to this taco Del Mar about 3 times a week. It is great. Short lines. No obnoxious people. Thick burritos (they aren&apos;t cheap on toppings like some). Extremely nice employees. They always let me have a water cup with my mondo. They always have some bomb hot sauce to go with the food. It really is a all in one sort of great package Taco Del Mar. My friends and I come here an we&apos;re never disappointed. I would recommend this Taco Del Mar to my grandma if she wanted some good food.,"It is a quick and inexpensive burrito shop. They have a sign on the door about being vegetarian friendly. They are not. Most good veggie burritos have roasted veggies, or even a tofu option. This place just makes a regular burrito but leaves off the meat. There are several better options nearby.","It&apos;s fast food, but its pretty good and cheap. The employees are great, very friendly and they&apos;ll pack your burrito full. The parking lot has that one strange spot that isn&apos;t a spot, so when people park there it&apos;s a hassle to get there going southbound. Don&apos;t park there, its not a spot.","MMMMMM.....  delicious. When I&apos;m in a hurry this is where I love to stop by and grab some quick tacos. I don&apos;t like their fish tacos, but only because I don&apos;t like deep fried fish fillets.","Food is not bad, however if your a clean freak beware that ownership is very frugal and would not always buy soap to wash dishes and employees would bring in their own soap once it became unbearable. Hopefully things have changed but keep that in mind when you walk in.","I love Taco Del Mar. The price is great and the food is a huge step up from Taco Bell. As far as this location goes, the parking is difficult but the people who work in the restaurant are very nice. 

I usually go with the Mondo burrito, which is just along the same lines of a burrito from chipotle or Qdoba.","So, my thing with Taco Del Mar is that its semi-tasty, but nothing special.

This location offers the same. I usually stick with their taco salads or Nachos. If I do happen to be in the mood for a burrito, I&apos;ll get their fish one as it seems to be the most tasty.

Make sure you get yourself a punch card if you&apos;re an avid visitor!","Went through the drive thru during Covid and accidentally was given the wrong order, called and Manger Paul was very nice and replaced our order after we called in.","Great place to hit in the middle of the night to take care of your munchies!! Dorito loco taco to be exact.. yum, yum,  yummy.","This is a bad Taco Bell all around, even by COVID standards. The gentleman who took our order was very nice, but the young woman at the window was distracted, careless, and unconcerned. She dumped part of our drink on the ground while haphazardly trying to hand us our drinks in these weird bins. &quot;Oops!&quot; She exclaimed them proceeded to say &quot;I guess I&apos;ll fill that back up.&quot; Mistake happen. But she almost forgot to give us our card because she and the rest of the staff were casually chatting like it was a Friday night party.

Then they forgot to include the second Chalupa in the Chalupa box. We went in to ask for the second one. The woman was so perplexed. We 
 stated &quot;the box comes with two. Can we have the second&quot; and she responds &quot;you wanted extra steak--what?&quot; Excellent customer service skills! We had to repeats two times, pointing at the board to get her to understand. The kicker was my &quot;nacho&quot; fries. See the photo. You tell me if these look like the ads.

Lazy effort. If you&apos;re going to do something, just do it right so you don&apos;t have to deal with complaints like this. We&apos;re contacting the manger tomorrow because clearly there is no one on duty or if there is, they&apos;re inattentive and a poor manager.",Had to wait over half an hour for a mobile app order... Got a free chalupa box but wouldn&apos;t use the app again,"Taco Bell, you have a rude white man working for you. I only bring skin into this because he&apos;s the only white dude I ever see there. 

He opened the little window so I put my cash (and coins out), then he shuts it. Then when I&apos;m looking away he opens his little window again, and grabs it, almost spilling the quarters etc. 

Then he hands me my soda, shuts window. 
Hands me bag, shuts window. I had to ask if I could get some Fire sauce. He throws it in the bag.

I wouldn&apos;t be leaving this lame review if he wasn&apos;t also the guy that last time I came through, was a complete jerk on the intercom. I ordered a bean burrito and waited for prompt, bc all other employees ask if you&apos;d like sour cream. He goes &quot;I&apos;M LISTENING&quot;

This guy needs a new job. I am industry- my first job was Skippers, I did retail (dear god), I did mortgage, I&apos;ve bartended for 14yrs, I&apos;ve managed. Everyone else at this branch is always sweet. This dude needs to do some soul searching. 

(and for the record I am also white)
(not a racial bash)",At night around sundown the parking lot turns into a drop off and pick up area for prostitutes. Suspicious characters and drug dealers blast their beats well into the morning. I don&apos;t know how the neighbors tolerate the noise and confusion. The staff do not inspect the area at all. I really like the food and the workers are alright but the constant suspocious action negates everything.,"I still don&apos;t understand why Uber drivers need to walkin inside to get there customers order when no one is in the drive through!!

I had to cancel 3 orders after the employee who work there told me to cancel. He is not the owner so he doesn&apos;t care if three orders were canceled. 

U guys need to fix ur stupid policy. And work with us as we work with u!","I took two kids I was babysitting with me through the drive through this Friday, July 5. 
We only ordered 5 soft shell taco
Supremes and 2 nacho fries-not a difficult order. 
The tacos were in a larger bag and the fries in a smaller separate bag-WITHOUT THE NACHO CHEESE. Ugh. Got home and no nacho cheese!! 4 dollars for tiny thing of fries and no nacho cheese?! 
So so annoying. We didn&apos;t see until we got home and I wasn&apos;t going to drive all the way back. But that is half the bag missing from a nacho fry order. Pissed.","I came in right before they closed ‚Äç I had a long day, didn&apos;t eat, and had just taken my bf to the  ER. These guys were sooo nice and hands down, the BEST Taco Bell chicken quesadilla I&apos;ve ever had. 

You guys rock. My order was perfect.","I generally love taco Bell, but the service here tonight was pretty awful.  

Drinks were basically just carbonation(watched the guy as he filled, dumped, and refilled with more carbonation sans syrup.  

Also basically got yelled at when asking for a freeze since the machine was down.  

Really weird, guy just seemed angry.  Hope he&apos;s alright and this is just some weird fluke.","Taco Bell is underrated and has great healthy options. 

Basically everything on the menu can be made vegan. 
How to:
Step 1: ask for Crunchwrap 
Step 2: ask for it to be fresco style (removes cheese and sauces, replaces them with pico de gallo)
Step 3: ask to sub the meat for beans

Do that for basically any item and you&apos;re set. I also recommend the phone app so you easily do all the customizations yourself and even have it ready for pick up.","Taco Bell has rarely been one to disappoint with their vast menu. However, our experience at this particular Taco Bell was less than satisfactory. We were in the area around 10pm on a Saturday night and were craving some Taco Bell. Sadly, most of the food came out looking bland, minimal, and lacking in flavor. I was especially shocked opening up my order of nachos to see so little chips and so little cheese. Time to try out some other Taco Bell locations... 

OVERALL:
*Service: 2/5
*Variety: 4/5 (Taco Bell menu is all about variety)
*Would I come back again: Not to this location
*Would I recommend: Not to this location","The manager (tall white guy) who works night shift is a dick. The first time he was so rude and slammed the window shut on me i was just like whatever. Maybe hes having a bad day and working retail i understand. The second time he cashed me out, left my food by the window and a few minutes later open the window and says &quot;what?&quot; I said you never gave me my food. He got mad slammed the window left me at the drive thru for another few mins then open the window and literally threw my food into my car. I can tell he doesnt wanna be there but he doesnt have to treat people like that. I would be rude back but its not worth it and havent been here in almost 1 yr.","I&apos;m hopelessly devoted to Taco Bell&apos;s food but I had a weird experience here today. I mobile ordered, walked in  at a slow moment (no one at the front) and was greeted by who I think was the security guard. She asked if I&apos;d been helped; I was like yeah, I put a mobile order in. She asked if I was Hilary and I was like yes, thanks. So she SHOUTED to the back, &quot;HILARY&apos;S HERE. HILARY&apos;S HERE FOR THE MOBILE ORDER.&quot; Over and over again. It wasn&apos;t like they couldn&apos;t hear her; again there was no one in line or anything. But now all the tweakers on 90th know me by name and face. I think I was visibly uncomfortable lol

I would really suggest not taking this approach if it&apos;s at all possible to avoid it, it&apos;s not fun for the customer to stand there and have her name shouted around the restaurant","I almost never give bad reviews because I understand that mistakes happen but every single time I&apos;ve ordered delivery from this location (5 times now), an entire item is wrong. We will order 3 or 4 of something and receive 3 or 4 of something completely different. I wouldn&apos;t normally care about this too much but we are vegetarian and very often we will receive meat items instead of what we ordered so it&apos;s not like we can even eat the mistake and it&apos;s a waste of food and money. I suggest if you&apos;re going to order from here, you do it in person so you can make sure your order is correct.","Waited in the drive through for 45 minutes. What the fuck is going on. Am I fucked up or is 45 minutes for a drive through fucked up? I couldn&apos;t even leave, I was trapped. No way out, no way in. 45 minutes for a fucking cheesy taco 
45 MINUTES FOR A CHEESY TACO WTF BITCH","Lol this location is strange, of course because it&apos;s right on aurora, where junkies and homeless people skull around the restaurant. Not only that, but I swear just about everyone who works there is high every time I come in here. I went in yesterday with my son, ordered my food at the kiosk and they end up giving my order to the wrong person, and the guy who received my food didn&apos;t seem mentally stable enough to tell he got the wrong order. The people who work there are oblivious and they don&apos;t even check who&apos;s receiving the right orders, they just hand it to whoever comes to the front looking for their food. After witnessing the workers give this same mad multiple orders, I told them they gave my food to someone else. The cashiers seemed very oblivious as to what I was talking about, then a man who looked like a manager came to &quot;correct&quot; the situation and offered to give me free Cinnabites for the inconvenience. I figured the situation was handled and I&apos;d be getting my food soon, then another man who looked like a manager asks for the order again after I&apos;d talked to the other manager. I finally got my food, but didn&apos;t get my cinnabites that they said they were going to throw in with the order for the troubles lol way to handle customer mishaps, Im going to the Ballard location from now on, this location is already strange as it is","Came in for dine in service, it was very busy, window and dine-in service.  I&apos;ve been coming here fir 5 years, food is always consistent and delicious!  The cashier &quot;Filmon G.&quot; suggested a combo for my meal.  The business was very busy but he still had time to make sure what I selected would be best for me.  I&apos;m always amazed at the friendly smiles and service from employees because of its difficult location dealing with the homeless people etc.  Thank you &quot;Filmon G.&quot; for making my lousy difficult day a little brighter because you care about your customers and the awesome contagious smile you give everyone.  Thank you!",You wonder why the ballard one is always full and its because of your attitude :) the manager has a bad attitude and they always forget the sauce :(,"Double checked if my food was fresco style. He said it was, it wasn&apos;t. Found out when home. Went back to get it remade, they still added cheese. And they were soooo soggy. What can you expect from taco bell. They didn&apos;t even bother to apologize.","I&apos;ve ordered from Mojito directly for pick-up and I&apos;ve also had it delivered to me via Uber Eats. This place is great. I love the Pabell√≥n and Lech√≥n Asado. 

Make sure you get the green and orange sauces. So good!

Thanks Victor!","Uber eats delivered us a meal from here. We tried 3 of the entrees and several of the appetizers, planning to split it between 3 people family style. A fight quickly broke out because no one wanted to share.

Outstanding food. Can&apos;t wait till we can eat there in person! May just grab my own table there and never leave!","I am kicking myself for never having been here before. Why did it take me a whole pandemic to discover this gem? 

The inside was closed due to COVID and while at first I was hesitant about outdoor seating, I had no reason to be because those outdoor heaters are toasty!! Plus the blankets that were brought over made it even better. 

We started out with fresh ceviche followed by beef, cheese and chicken empanadas. While I couldn&apos;t partake in the ceviche due to an allergy, the empanadas were BOMB and I could have eaten them as a meal by themselves! All 3 were equally tasty and they&apos;re made out of cornmeal making them gluten free which was even better!

I then had the guiso de pollo which was half of a chicken simmered in a tomato-based sauce with capers, olives and white wine. It also came with a side of rice, black beans and tostones. Holy portions, this was huge! I&apos;m pretty sure I have meals for the next 2 days! On top of that, it was delicious! The chicken was tender and juicy, the sauce was tasty and I don&apos;t know what was in the black beans and rice but they were super flavorful! My husband had the vaca frita which was equally delicious. I&apos;m not sure how they get the meat so tender and crispy at the same time. 

Right when I thought we were done, out came dessert - the tres leches and quesillo which is a flan-like dessert. Ummmm wow! I am not a huge dessert person but the tres leches was the perfect amount of sweetness and the quesillo...just wow. The texture is a little thicker and richer than flan...and so much better.

On top of that, Luam and his wife along with their wonderful staff are so lovely and fun! We were so well taken care of. I wish we lived closer because I saw they deliver on Grubhub and other food delivery services. It&apos;s so important to support local restaurants these days...and this is one that I&apos;ll definitely be back to!","You know that feeling where you&apos;re super full but you can&apos;t stop eating because it&apos;s just that flavorful? Well that is totally my experience at Mojitos. It&apos;s tucked away so definitely follow the directions on the website. I ordered a mojito (duh) and the Vaca Grits for lunch. It was glorious. So yummy and just full of flavor. The sauces served with the dish gave every bite a punch. I also ordered a rum punch because I&apos;m an alcoholic. And it was super yummy too. 
But the best part was the service. My server, Ana, was so nice and accommodating. I was even checked on by a manager.
I can&apos;t wait to bring my friends to this gem of a restaurant. Excited to explore the entire menu.","I know I am supper harsh on Hispanic businesses, but it is because I am Hispanic. I have had may share of Hispanic food and I am somewhat good at cooking it myself. The food was cooked. Nothing was hard or under cooked. Meat was tender and jut right. However; everything tasted the same. Everything was over powers by vinaigrette. Way too much.  Another thing location!!!! Omg I was sitting there for a minute and I about witness 3 car accidents. It&apos;s a one way street and well should I say it. Hispanic!!! People were coming in the wrong way. Then there were a group of kids coming in the right way but at supper spread they almost crash against someone coming the wrong way. I speak of them cause they went in to the restaurant as if they own the place I would not be surprised if they are family of the owner. For them reason only 3 stars. The de flan was good.","We ordered takeout from here because of all the high praise I&apos;ve seen. Unfortunately, their food did not live up to the high reviews I&apos;ve seen. 

I ordered the Camarones Carmen Miranda dish, and it was just okay at best. The rice and plantain chips came soggy, and the shrimp tasted overcooked. I understand that since I got takeout, it probably accounted for the sogginess, but even then the shrimp was rubbery and there were too many mangoes in my opinion. The dish also just kind of tasted sour... I really do believe that my experience would have likely been quite different if I got to dine in, but unfortunately I just wasn&apos;t satisfied with my meal at all. It was also really pricey ($18) for a mediocre portion! 

I will say that their mojitos are really strong and pretty good. Overall though, I wasn&apos;t happy with my meal.","We get take out ANY CHANCE WE GET from Luam at Mojito!! The staff is THE friendliest youll5ever meet, and the food is incredible - in flavor, and consistency. Vaca frita is my go- to. Don&apos;t be silly. Just go.","This place is great!!  Food was so good and delicious. It&apos;s a small location with minimal seating but you can get food AND drinks to go!!  Remember its Cuban food and some of the best I&apos;ve had. Oh, the drinks are great!!","Great food! Great service!!! 
Have been there several time. Victor is super nice!!! All of their sandwiches are tasty and definitely worth a try. There are even several times they didn&apos;t charge me for drinks.
Support local business!!!","I come to mojito on lake city way about twice a week. I would probably come here 3-4 times a week if I lived nearby. I get the mojito sandwich. It&apos;s like a Cuban but better. The empanadas are also PHENOMENAL but I prefer the beef and chicken to the cheese.

The meat is always fresh in the sandwich and perfectly cooked. The garlic cilantro sandwich spread is zesty and delicious and the Swiss cheese and Mayo brings the pork and the bread together incredibly. They use fresh French bread and it&apos;s just a great sandwich. You will see this sandwich on tv someday 

The empanadas are crispy corn  empanadas and they are very unique from what I have tried and I really like them 

Chef Ana did an incredible job on Wednesday, January 20th. Having such delicious food is the highlight of my week and I&apos;m truly thankful for you. Thank you!

I always get excellent service from Victor, he always makes sure my order is perfect and treats everyone like family.

Thank you to Mojito and the staff for making this a neighborhood GEM","Mojito, thanks for the excellent Cuban food and warm hospitality. After visiting Miami, a few months ago, I was afraid I wouldn&apos;t be able to find quality Cuban food. Well... let me tell you, this place is phenomenal. No need to go to Miami. Also, really enjoyed speaking to the owner and hearing his incredible story. Thanks for keeping my wife warm with the outdoor heaters, great customer service. Made us feel like we were at home.","Doing only take out right now for COVID, but you can order Mojitos to go!! The small straws are so annoying to drink out of though - I wish they had normal straws haha 

The food tasted healthy and fresh, so it was a good change to the normal &quot;takeout&quot;. 

I will return!","This place is home.  This place is family.  The staff are amazing.  The owner, Luam is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  Victor is one of the most attentive servers ever.

Now the food.  HOLY Moses!  My favorite is the Vaca Frita.  It&apos;s perfectly prepared... but even just the black beans and rice are so delicious.  

Come for the food, hang under a heater on the patio, have a cocktail too.

This place is a treasure.","This food was incredible! My boyfriend got the Vaca Frita and loved it. I got the El Mojito sandwich and it was phenomenal. 

We actually look right out to Mojito from our bedroom window and have always talked about giving it a try. Because of the Seattle snow storm, our Valentine&apos;s dinner options were limited to &quot;within walking distance&quot; and I&apos;m so thankful for it. I&apos;m sad we didn&apos;t give this place a try sooner and we will certainly become regulars now! Absolutely delicious!","This food is incredible! Everything I&apos;ve tried has been amazing! The owner is so fun and kind. Id eat here everyday if i could! My favs are all the tortas, lechon and the platter! If you like Spicy their home made hot sauce. I could drink it. Seriously obsessed. Do your self a favor and order this! We went to  Reservoir Bar &amp; Grill
To have drinks on their covid safe patio when we found out you could call and order DIRECTLY From Mojitos for delivery! I wish i had pictures but we are everything to quickly","We had read about Mojito in a Seattle Times article and after trying arepas once before in Montreal, were excited to see that they offer the same dish and other delicious Latin dishes. 

We decided to try a variety of dishes to celebrate a birthday and were so impressed!  Our favorites were the arepas, empanadas, oxtail soup, Pescado En Guiso (a delightful fish dish with olives and tomatoes), and chicken en guiso.  The rice was so delicious--it reminded me of a hybrid of sticky rice and basmati rice combined.  I wish I could determine what the spices were in the oxtail soup, so flavorful!  

We will quite look forward to making this a regular stop for dinner take out.  Delicious food and a sweet staff/owner....","SUPPORT BLACK OWNED RESTAURANTS. 

Recently ordered take out at Mojito after seeing this restaurant listed in a few Instagram posts. We ordered up front and it took us about 50 minutes to get our food. I guess there was a confusion with the online order pick ups so only online orders were being made. About 10 people were waiting as we watched people come and pick up their food. The owner was super nice - he came out and apologized to everyone! 

Aside from the experience, the food was good but nothing special. Maybe it was because we togo-ed, but the food seemed to have lacked some seasoning. The sandwich was bland and the steak was missing a sauce to give it that savory flavor. The maduros was perfect though, cooked perfectly and couldn&apos;t get enough. I would give this place another chance but would come back once it&apos;s open for dine in!","One of my favorite grub spots in all of Seattle-- Mojito&apos;s will have you leaving feeling full, satisfied, and ready to come back. The food is incredible. I&apos;m quite sure everything on the menu is absolutely delicious and I don&apos;t think the chefs here know how to make anything other than spectacular. 

Not only is there great food, but the service is wonderful. The chefs and employees do an awesome job making everyone feel comfortable, and satisfied. Shout to out to my man Victor for the excellent service.

The house made hot sauce is absolutely to die for, and the Vaca Frita dinner was outstanding. If you haven&apos;t eaten here yet, I ask you: What are you doing with your life?!?!? You&apos;re seriously missing out. Mojito is full of great food and great people, and easily is 10/10 eatery. I would give 6 stars if I could!","Mojotos is a consistent winner for delicious food and drinks. They set the standard that I compare all other Mojotos to: I think the small ice cubes really makes a difference.  The atmosphere is still boisterous even when ordering to-go. The staff really make you feel special and welcome you as long lost friends, and that&apos;s worth writing a review for! Thank you for the meals and welcome, Victor, Liam, and Mojotos staff :)","This place is THE BOMB. I went there today and ordered the Lechon Asado. It was amazing. The meat was so tendered and everything on the plate went together so well. The servers were really nice and the atmosphere was great. I ended up chatting with Victor who was also very lovely. When I paid for my meal, Victor gave me a take out of their Sancocho de Cola ( which is their Sunday Special). The soup was also amazing and had so much flavor. I will definitely be back! Thank you for the great service","Hard to believe I never submitted a review for Tapas Lab- cute place in Greenlake with very delicious crave-worthy menu items! I see I haven&apos;t been here in over a couple of years, but feeling that I should rectify this soon :)

Tapas Lab anticipation got me (mentally &amp; physically) through several rough PureBarre workouts right around the corner - the thought of mouth-watering bites, a glass of wine, and a good catch-up with workout friends got my aching muscles to the other side of a brutal workout.

Their menu changes seasonally, but as any type of small-bites meal (tapas, afternoon tea, dim sum, amuse-bouche... you get the idea) is my favorite dining experience, TL definitely delivers with amazing flavor.  I see the menu listed on their website now is a bit more robust than what I remember and I am guessing that is a sign of the (Covid) times to help with the bigger take-out business.  I never went wrong with the deviled egg or any of the pinchos I have had in the past, flavor combinations were always spot-on and unique and I am confident that no matter whatever the chef puts on the menu will be tasty and satisfying.

FOOD: Shrimp Pincho, Cured Salmon Pincho, Anchovy Pincho.
DRINK: Glass of Txakoli Rozabal (rose).",This is a lovely little spot for Green Lake. It&apos;s my favorite restaurant during COVID since I can just walk there and pick up some of their delicious food. Their menu also is very reasonably priced. The food is very fresh also! I can&apos;t wait until it&apos;s safe to dine indoors again because the restaurant ambience is very cute and nice for date night.,"Visited Tapas Lab right after happy hour ended. Bummer, but the prices aren&apos;t too bad to begin with. Tapas Lab is definitely a fusion restaurant &amp; they do it very very well. Customer service was great, they paid attention to ensure customer&apos;s safety. I initially sat outdoors but it started to rain so we asked to be moved indoors (that&apos;s bipolar Seattle weather for you!). The waitress immediately helped us move our dishes indoors for us. Got to try out Quinoa Stuffed Mushrooms, Shrimp Pincho, Jam√≥n Pincho, &amp; Anchovy Pincho. All were delectable! I&apos;d definitely have to come back and try out more of their dishes.","I&apos;m so happy I was introduced to this place by a friend. It&apos;s absolutely amazing. I recommend ordering a bunch of stuff to try. 

They don&apos;t have the biggest menu but they have great items. I didn&apos;t have one thing I didn&apos;t enjoy. 
I already want to go back. 

I loved the salmon pincho and the sliders. Those were my favorites for sure. Everything else was also amazing though.","VISIT HISTORY: 4/5
- Last visit: last week for late dinner 
- Frequency: first time per recommendation by roommate
- Visit again? yes, would travel out of the way. Great for date night or intimate gathering 

FOO(D)RINK: 4.5/5
- wine sampler (arrived 1 min 10 sec): 3 sample sizes. I am a lightweight and the amount was plenty throughout the course of the meal. 
- olives (1min 36 sec): pretty standard. Not as salty which I appreciate.
Quinoa stuffed mushroom (4 min 12sec): creamy perfection. Really delightful. The sauce game is to admire. I want the recipe! 
- yellowtail (7min 46 sec): my roomie wanted some. The subtle truffle oil is something to treasure. 
- salmon pincho: the honey cream cheese pairs so well. Would get again! 
- wagyu slider (12min 46sec): it&apos;s SO juicy!!! If you can get one thing from the menu, it&apos;s this. Every bite was perfection. Salivating writing about it.  if I can have this once a week, I&apos;d be a happy woman. 
- ricotta meatballs (12min 46 sec): I wish I liked it more... It was okay. I also might&apos;ve filled myself up by the time this arrived. The ingredient list was up there so it must&apos;ve been really epic. Bc I had the wagyu, it couldn&apos;t compete. 

- Overall: definitely would get the sliders and pincho if/when I return. We were one of 4 parties. All the food arrived on a timely fashion, all under 15 min. 

VIB(E)XPERIENCE: 3/5 
- Decoration: brick wall and small light designs
- Staff: low key and chill. She was honest if we were ordering too much food. 
- Noise level: low 
- Wait time for foo(d)rink arrival: 1-13 minutes. Food came as it was prepared. 
- Wait time for our check:  did not record but didn&apos;t notice much wait.","An odd little gem tucked away in Greenlake. A  killer happy hour, creative little dishes,like delicious pinchos &amp; deviled eggs. Great beer. Nice servers, comfy patio.
    Recommended. Just don&apos;t tell everyone !",Great food - wonderful new addition to Greenlake offerings! Got three tapas and a bowl and it was a fabulous lunch!,I got the Chirashi Monster Bowl off their new menu and it was delicious! I also got a miso soup on the side that I believe came with it and they added a side chef salad as a thank you and I always appreciate a side salad that isn&apos;t drenched in dressing and isn&apos;t soggy! Can&apos;t wait to try other bowls from the Monster bowl menu!,"Loved Tapas Lab! Easy to get there from the nearest exit and fantastic service. We arrived and ordered during Happy Hour, prices were more than reasonable. Ordered the Wagyu sliders, the Shrimp Shumai &amp; a red wine flight. Wine was delicious and well recommended by our waiter. They&apos;re doing small, well lit, tents (with one open side) for outdoor dining. They provided space heaters but I would still advise a jacket since some of them were having trouble with propane. Food was fantastic, it was tough not to order more sliders to eat on the way home. We&apos;ll be back!","We&apos;ve gotten a handful of takeout dishes during COVID, and enjoyed each dish! They have a reduced menu, but still have pinchos and some other favorites. (The food is artfully prepared too--even for takeout.)  In addition, they have some Korean dishes like rice bowls for a real bargain--$10 spicy pork bowl with rice, miso soup and caesar--does it get any better than that?","Sangria tasted like what I&apos;ve gotten from a box or bottle from Costco.  Sherry flight was good.

Bulgogi tapa was more on the sweeter side than I would like.

Loved the ham tapa the most!  Definitely get it.  Shrimp was second best with caviar and red pepper on the bottom.

Spiced nuts is marcona almonds with cinnamon egg white covered nuts which I&apos;ve also gotten from Costco.  

Service was good.  Just not too impressed with the tapas.  I still prefer Ocho.","They&apos;re open during COVID! FYI the couple that owns/runs this place is being extra clean and careful during these times. I really appreciate restaurants that are going above and beyond in that regard. This is going to be my go-to spot for the foreseeable future.

We tried the spicy pork bowl, which was delicious. It came with a side salad and miso soup. Can&apos;t recommend this place enough!","Delicious! All day happy hour on Sundays makes this my new favorite place in Greenlake. I got three Pinchos for $3 each, a cheese plate for my 5 year old, a deviled egg, and Marcona almonds. Add a beer and an apple juice and our total bill was $24 before tip. That is a fabulous deal for dinner no matter what restaurant, and that the food was divine is just icing on the cake. I will definitely be back.","I came here with a friend for a lovely dinner and was not disappointed! There were many items on the menu and we were pretty overwhelmed with what to order. In the end, we decided to order the Curry Hummus with Naan, Watermelon w/ Gorgonzola Cheese, Bulgogi Pincho, Jamon Pincho, Cured Salmon Pincho, and Tuna Tartare.

Everything tasted delicious! I love cream cheese with my sushi so the Cured Salmon Pincho was my favorite Pincho that we ordered. The Jamon Pincho was my least favorite - it was a little salty and hard to eat since the meat wasn&apos;t easily torn. But my favorite dish by far was the Watermelon w/ Gorgonzola Cheese. When reading it, it seems odd to pair watermelon with gorgonzola cheese, crispy prosciutto, and mint...but it somehow works.

We ended our dinner with the Warm Brownie dessert (that also came with ice cream). Perfect way to end our dinner!","We tried the monster bowls today and wow, they are Amazing! Bonus miso and salad was perfect! The picture is the mermaid","Food of the highest quality; absolutely love their take on Asian fusion. Tried the truffle gnocchi, wagyu sliders, shumai and dragon bowl. Everything was phenomenal. It is a little pricey, but completely worth it in my opinion.","Small Plates 
They have many different options, and it&apos;s fun to share with your friends! I personally love meatball, they have a recipe at the restaurant and teach you how to make it. Those watermelon cubes are refreshing and it&apos;s interesting to pair with cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. Love their Roast octopus with mushroom risotto too! Worth to try this place! And It&apos;s really close to Greenlake!

Food: 10/10 
Service: 10/10 
Environment: 10/10",This is a really great tapas bar near Greenlake. I loved almost every food we ordered on the menu. Deviled egg was surprisingly good. Anything wagyu was also good. Server has the mask and gloves on all the time and service was also fantastic. I will definitely come back.,"We were getting a but hungry walking around Green Lake and saw a sign for tapas lab. It&apos;s not a prime location for the restaurant, but we found it and decided to try it after looking at the menu. 

Ambiance: I can&apos;t really speak to it. We sat outside. They have only two open tables. 

Service: very friendly

Food: VERY good. We got picked out some pinchos (anchovy was the best), deviled eggs (get them, they were the best part of our meal), truffle steak (small in size but yummy), and the salmon tartar (really good but nothing special). I would say everything was 5 stars but the salmon tartar, which I would give 4 stars. 

It&apos;s a little hidden treasure. I would highly recommend.","When I hear Spanish/Asian fusion, my mouth immediately turns into a pursed straight line. Like, cool, I expect a mediocre/watered down version of both.

But! I was very pleasantly surprised by this!

My husband and I wanted to go for a late dinner somewhere near Greenlake and found this place on Yelp. Again, I was skeptical about the theme but the menu sounded interesting.

Favorites:
Drunken Mussels - This is a generous portion of mussels in a beautiful white wine broth with lots of garlic and a bit of welcome heat from red pepper flakes. I had never had mussels with thyme but I actually quite liked that addition too because it added a fresh herb element. Wish they served it with more bread!

Pork belly &amp; bulgogi buns - Loved the pickled daikon served on top which added both a crunch and a nice acidity to balance the sweet and fatty meats served inside the bun.

Deviled eggs - I love deviled eggs! I was just telling my husband that I love ordering deviled eggs at tapas restaurants because it tends to be a flavor-packed bite. And we weren&apos;t wrong! I&apos;m not sure how frequently they change this but when we went, it had candied bacon and some jalapeno (?) pepper. It was fantastic.

Could use improvement:

Ricotta meatballs - The marinara sauce was a little too acidic for my liking. It had that unmistakable canned tomato acidic flavor. There isn&apos;t anything wrong with canned tomatoes but I do wish it had a better flavor. Also, I loved how fluffy the meatballs were, but missed the browning on them.

Cauliflower - Don&apos;t get me wrong. We annihilated this. But! It was charred with a torch and you can taste that. Wish it was pan-seared or oven broiled instead.

Despite the two dishes that were kind of meh, I enjoyed my dinner here in part because of how kind their staff is and that you can sense the kitchen is very thoughtful about each dish they serve. The prices were also pretty reasonable for a tapas restaurant and they had a variety of dish sizes which was also nice. The food is probably a 4 star (for now) but the overall experience was a 5.","I ordered Bok a Bok via DoorDash during the Pandemic. Man, was it good. This is my second time at a Bok a Bok and I don&apos;t recall it being this good, but it&apos;s up there with some of the best fried chicken I&apos;ve ever had. I got 2 boneless thighs that were super moist and a delicious batter that wasn&apos;t at all overwhelming. I paired it with Dirty Tots that were tasty but definitely made the meal weightier. The sauces accompanying the chicken were awesome compliments. I can&apos;t say I have any complaints about the food at all. If I&apos;m back on the Ave (btw, is the Ave always host to the best fried chicken?) I&apos;ll be sure to grab some more from BaBFC. Also, the food was ready really quickly and the DoorDash estimate was very accurate. Delish!","Yummy. Good crispy fried chicken. 

I have to admit, the rice queso was almost a little bit too much, but overall I would come back. It is reasonably priced. I loved that their sodas are Jones.","Diners, drive ins, and dives approved?! I knew I had to give it a try. Especially when there is one walking distance from my place.
Verdict? Eh, just OK. Perhaps I didn&apos;t order the right things?! 
The fish sauce wings were almost overly breaded. They would be 100x better not breaded. Because of this, the sauce doesn&apos;t stick well and it needed more. Presentation was nice. Flavor was there for the most part. A little too sweet and not spicy enough in my opinion. 
The dirty rice was OK. Portion enough for two people. Again, this was pretty average though. Basically rice and sauce... and an egg...nothing to write home about.
I would perhaps come back to try something else, but not any time soon. Average in my opinion.","I ordered 5 wet wings and 5 dry rub wings based on server&apos;s recommendations. And guess what, I literally got totally different wings from what I ordered. I got 10 wet wings and those wet wings werent even the ones I ordered. 

I live few miles away so I wasn&apos;t even able to go back so I decided to just try these wings and guess what, wings weren&apos;t cooked enough that the meat was pink. Im not sure how to respond to this. I&apos;m thinking about reporting this place to the health department for selling undercooked meat.","This spot is right next to the U district farmers market so we decided to grab some food togo. My kid read the sign and saw fried chicken and asked for some so that&apos;s what we did. 

Here&apos;s what I ordered:

10 pc fried chicken legs - the drumsticks were freakishly HUGEEEEE which was a bit off-putting. flavor was great, but since the drums were so large, the batter inside wasn&apos;t cooked all the way. I would pass on these unless you get normal sized legs. 

10 pc fried wings - DA BOMB! Crispy, crunchy, flavorful, juicy, seasoned well. Order these!!

New classic fried chicken sandwich - nothing too fancy or out of the ordinary. was good, but can live without it.

Yuzu green chili sandwich - I am a sucker for anything yuzu!!! sadly, it didn&apos;t deliver on the yuzu flavor. the green chilies were kinda there. the fried chicken was amazing though

Ginger cabbage slaw - nice and refreshing 

Biscuit - FLUFFFYYYYYY goodness. kiddos approved 

Would I come back here? Yes b/c their chicken wings are good as hell and bc they&apos;re right by the farmers market :)","I had never been here before but when getting to the window and looking at the menu there are so many delicious looking options to choose from. If you love sauces and sides, there will be many to consider.

I ended up ordering the tater tots and then wings (Fish Sauce Caramel and Dry BBQ Rub). I love a good tater tot. My preference is fluffy soft middle and a little crisp on the outside. These were far from that. They had a tiny bit of potato filling and were are hard crunch for exterior. I am not sure if they had an issue with the fryer and something happened but they were not good.

For the wings, I expected more flavor. The dry BBQ Rub was sprinkled on the wings, barely. The fish sauce wings were the better ones out of the two but also only okay.

Would I give the place a second chance? Maybe. Would I go back intentionally? Probably not. But they were okay enough for me to say formulate your own opinion.","Went here for the Doordash promotion to pick up.  Got the sampler platter which comes with three OG wings, one drumstick, one thigh, Kim chi Mac and cheese as well as a biscuit.  It is enough for two people.  

Thigh was a bit of a miss because it wasn&apos;t fried on the spot, but the OG wings were based on the crispiness.  Kim chi Mac and cheese tasted ok.  They used Velveeta cheese and topped it with scallions and fried shallots.  The biscuit was very dense, so much so that I couldn&apos;t eat half.

I noticed that when waiting you shouldn&apos;t follow the status of the order, but check in during its estimated time of being done because they were not good in updating the food status.  In fact it still didn&apos;t say it was complete after we had picked up the meal and ate dessert an hour later.",5 stars because I&apos;m gluten sensitive and being able to get fried chicken again is so so good. Might have bumped it down to 4 due to one of the thighs being a bit underdone. Not a big thing a little time in the oven took care of that. The legs were just done . Very good  and juicy in but much less and and not so good. No problem but something to watch for. The crust was fairly thick and crunchy. I really liked it. They claim spicy but not really. I could drink there hot sauce straight. Stand out was their biscuits. I couldn&apos;t eat one but my wife reported that it was better than her great grandma&apos;s biscuits and that is really saying something. Perfect no will I order again absolutely.,"Was really disappointed with this place. We made a pretty big order and tried a large amount of the menu. 

A few pieces of chicken were undercooked and a little slimy. Of the five people that ordered chicken no one liked it. 

The outside is nice and crunchy but seems like a batter better suited to fish and chips not chicken. Portions are good. Fries and Tots were ok. We tried the plain and dirty fries with egg. 

The one stand thing I thought was better then average was the kimchi Mac and cheese.","Love this place! Found it because it came up under a &quot;gluten free&quot; search. While not everything is gluten free on their menu, all of their chicken is gluten free.... fried chicken and all! Their food is always fresh and hot. And all the chicken, including the breast meat, is always so juicy and yummy! They offer sauces with their chicken, which are Korean inspired and have a flair of kimchee. I&apos;m not a fan of their sauces but my husband who is a kimchee lover loves the sauces. I have not tried any of their sides since I&apos;m gluten free but I can attest that the chicken is bomb! 

Parking: Street and small parking lot

Restaurant: There are no sit-down options. This is just a walk-up order window. I do love that you can order online and arrive 10 minutes later to pick up and go. For those that order and want to eat immediately, there are some benches at the University Heights Center, which is directly across the street.","The fried chicken we ordered had somewhat of a funnel-cake-like breading to it rather than the rougher texture you&apos;d expect from most other places. The texture of the chicken itself wasn&apos;t too bad, but there wasn&apos;t much flavor in the chicken itself.

Given that, we hoped that the sauces might redeem it, but none of them were good. The spicy sauce just tasted heavily like Korean red pepper paste (gochujang), and not particularly in a good way; everything else tasted somewhat diluted and lacked character.",Love their classic chicken sandwich!  We regularly order from here. A little complaint: sauce containers: top is PET recyclable and bottom is PLA compostable...confusing for people...Hope this get these both PLA compostable,"I really wasn&apos;t expecting anything special, but was hoping that the chicken would be good since it&apos;s a chicken spot. I ordered 10 wings (flavors come in sets of 5). I asked the cashier which flavors were popular and he basically said everything, which isn&apos;t helpful, so I ended with the vinegar one and sesame soy garlic. The flavors were meh, nothing really too special. The wings themselves tasted like they could&apos;ve been cooked for longer (I was wondering if I was going to get sick later from undercooked chicken, but I survived to write this review).

The saving grace was actually 2 sides I bought. Dirty Tots and Kimchi Mac &amp; Cheese. Honestly, if I&apos;m looking for a late night munchie and carbo load, I&apos;m getting these again for sure.",We love the freshness and quality of the food here. If you could try only one thing here I highly recommend it be there kimchi Mac and cheese. Slaps! I also really enjoy their fries. The chicken is good but not the best we&apos;ve had. I go here more for the sides.,"Three stars has exactly what Bok a Bok deserves. It&apos;s another one of those places that will get the job done, but isn&apos;t particularly good or bad. The chicken is crispy, but the flavor needs improvement. I&apos;d eat again, but only on someone else&apos;s dime.","This place is decent, but it&apos;s just a walk-up window. There are no places to sit. Take out only.

The chicken is okay. A little greasy, and not as good as some of the other Korean chicken places. Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s good. Some of the other places are fantastic. Bok a Bok also has fewer sauce choices than other places.

The sides were great. Their dirty tots were superb.

Overall, a nice alternative when other places are closed.","Update: We came back and the wings were much better this time around! They were fried perfectly and better flavor.

Also, we got a chicken thigh. This thing was HUGE!!! It was juicy and boneless I believe. I think next time I will just get a thigh for  myself b/c less mess but still yummy.

In previous review the sandwich and mac and cheese were yummy too!

Overall, Bok Bok is a nice addition to the the neighborhood!","Saw this walk up window a few days ago. Decided to back track from Lake City late this Sunday afternoon, and head back to the UDistrict for some quality wings from Bok a Bok Fried Chicken (9/8/19). Turns out this was only Day 4 of service,  so very new at a former pizza spot.

Friendly person at the window who took my  order of 20 wings, with four sauces. A pair each of 4 Chili Hot Sauce and Sesame Soy Garlic were my choices. Had a brief wait, took Yelp photos, and talked briefly about the Seahawks with another customer. 

Soon with my takeout bag of goodness in hand, drove back to Shoreline.

Tasty, crispy, plump, juicy wings were still hot once arrived at home! Delicious. With tax and tip, this order was under $29. 

There are other Bok a Bok locations in Burien, White Center, Seattle/Capitol Hill, and now this walk up takeout window in Seattle/University District up at 52nd/UWay with a convenient adjacent tiny parking lot. 

Hopefully, another one can open in North Seattle or Shoreline. Until then, yay for this site opening. They have ample time to adjust to their new digs before the onslaught of UW students starting end of this month.","Get the Bowl O Shame. No trust me. You&apos;ll be happy you did. You might need to compensate with a little more kimchi on the side to fight off that heavy food, but it&apos;ll be worth it I promise. Uber Eats&apos;d this at my UW job. They throw in a free Jones Soda if you spend more than $15. Favorite order for late nights at the office. Keep the Korean Fried Chicken coming :) Thanks Bok A Bok","The only two time I had Bok A Bok was when my group ordered an 100 piece party pack. The chicken tasted pretty good but a lot of breading and a little bit too greasy. 

Food: The style of chicken they have is bland and then you add your own sauces onto the chicken. The chicken had a lot of breading and dough making you pretty full really fast. I&apos;m not too big of a fan of the sauces and I didn&apos;t think it matched that well with the chicken. The chicken itself was very moist and did taste good though.

Price: About average for the price

Overall, this place serves pretty standard fried chicken. The chicken itself taste alright and maybe a little bland at times.","This might be an all-time great late night food spot. I was brought here by a friend of mine after a long night, and we were welcomed in with open arms by the very friendly workers. I was feeling like eating a million fries, and they told me that one of their best selling items were the Aladdin fries. Although my friend was telling me that I was making a HUGE mistake by not ordering the shawarma, I had to go for it. 

I was really surprised by the layout of this place. It&apos;s pretty hilarious that they have couches you can sit on after you order your food. This seems like it would be a bad idea when you have floods of dizzy UW kids streaming in and spilling shawarmas. No worries though, they keep those couches sparkling, and it feels like you&apos;re just hanging out at somebody&apos;s house when you&apos;re hammering down some munchies. We ended up kicking it in here for about 2 hours, until they kicked us out in the nicest way possible (slowly putting up all of the chairs around us). 

I have been dreaming about the Aladdin fries for weeks. The perfect crispiness of those thangs, covered in that beautiful white sauce, with huge chunks of meat piled on top. A fork and knife will be your best companion for this adventure, unless you&apos;ve stocked up on wet wipes during the Great Quarantine of 2020.","I was stuck on lockdown in UW medical. Everything was closed and it was around 1 am, these guys were still open and came through in the clutch! Dope atmosphere as well music quick efficient service and the gyro was amazing, I should&apos;ve added more meat++.","Misread the menu and thought I was ordering a fava bean salad and pita spread with cheese and zatar but it turns out those menu items are sandwiches! Each consisted of a warm pita folded in half, piled high either either mashed fava beans or feta and zatar, slathered in tazieki sauce and raw vegetables.

I ate both sandwiches that night since I didn&apos;t think they would keep well- I was pleasantly stuffed! Each sandwich was delicious in it&apos;s own right - the fava beans warm and filling, while the zatar and feta created a tastebud explosion.

The price was incredible - $13 for two meal sized sandwiches plus tip. 

A must for a fast and tasty veggie sandwich!","Got the lamb gyro and the lamb shawarma. Both are excellent. The lamb is very well seasoned. Good saltiness, good herbs and spices, but not over done. Fresh lettuce and a refreshing yogurt sauce. Will definitely get it again.

I ordered the shawarma medium and it has a nice kick. But in the end it was half a notch below the gyro. I&apos;ll still eat it again tho.

Knock them off a star for missing my Greek salad. Ah well.","Our first time order was a dinner gyro plate, Aladdin fries, and a lamb and beef gyro sandwich. The meat was so flavorful and could quite possibly be the best gyro I&apos;ve ever had. I love the fresh salad counterbalance to the warm and heavy stuff. And the price was super reasonable considering it&apos;s Mediterranean food! Will definitely come back whenever I&apos;m back in town 


My friend also got a cauliflower gyro and said it was good!","WOW! Our first time trying this spot out today and we are definitely impressed. We ordered two Aladdin Gyro&apos;s, both under $10 and the Aladdin fries, also $9 and some change. Full disclosure: THE ALADDIN FRIES ARE A FULL MEAL IN ITSELF! We were unable to eat the fries after our gyro&apos;s, but good news is that the fries taste great cold too! I&apos;m sure you could also pop them in the oven if you wanted to, or microwave. 
The Tzatziki sauce is definitely #1 in terms of taste from other Greek spots we&apos;ve been to. And their chocolate baklava is super good! (So good I ate it before taking a photo lol)
They also have amazing service here! The guys who work here are super friendly. 
Will definitely be making my way down here again very soon.","I wanted to love this place but it just didn&apos;t sit right with me. The taste is decent, but it is way too greasy and oily for my liking. My fianc√© &amp; I both agreed that the food is too heavy. I ordered the rice platter w/ gyro meat &amp; he ordered a gyro.","Just ordered food, smell good. Will see how it tastes. Was charged .50 fr credit card. Cash preferred.  They are pretty busy for covid time. In and out. Will update after we get the food.","Ah yes. The famous Aladdin. If you&apos;re craving a post-midnight snack after a long night out, this is the #1 SPOT to go to.

Aladdin is open until 2:30am every morning to cater to the energetic college crowd. It&apos;s a small restaurant, so I would recommend getting takeout. However, there&apos;s usually a small table or two open in the back room. They also have another restaurant further down the Ave; I think that restaurant is a little bigger, but I still would not recommend it for seating large groups.

GET: ALADDIN FRIES- fresh out of the oil fries smothered with meat from the spinning spit and your choice of Tzatziki sauce or garlic sauce. My guy friends tend to like their fries with the lamb/beef combo, but I think I prefer the chicken because it&apos;s less rich and has a heavenly, dry curry rub. I also ask for light sauce because they tend to pour it with a heavy hand.

Service is usually quick (15min or less), but the kitchen is cramp and they only have two or three workers working at once. They are always very friendly and are prompt to take orders.

Their gyros and shwarmas are good, but Aladdin fries are pure comfort food on comfort food. When it&apos;s 2am and I need some substance to hold me over, all I can say is: Hallelujah for Aladdin!

Overall: 5/5 food, 5/5 service, 4/5 atmosphere","The best damn gyro around! My friend recommended this spot in the u district for their greek fries, so naturally we had to check it out. I got the gyro combo and upgraded my fries to greek fries. This has got to be the best and most fresh gyro I have ever tasted! fresh vegetables and homemade pita bread, creamy and tangy yogurt sauce, and the meat was juicy and seasoned to perfection. It doesn&apos;t get better than this...Oh wait.... it does....Greek fries!!!! Definitely worth the $2.50 upgrade fee, crispy French fries doused in their phenomenal yogurt sauce, fresh feta cheese sprinkled on top, and more of their delicious seasoning blend. If you&apos;re looking for the best Mediterranean food of your life (in the Seattle area) this place is the spot... seriously, you will not regret checking this place out.


DISCLAIMER:
This restaurant is NOT to be mistaken as Aladdin&apos;s Falafel Corner. This spot is about a block or two south of the Starbucks on university way. Red and yellow detailing on the storefront. Thanks! Just want to avoid any confusion as there are two &quot;Aladdin&apos;s____&quot; on the same street.","Absolutely excellent. I got their lamb/beef gyro and it was perfect - the ratios of meat:sauce:veggies was just right, the meat was perfectly cooked, and all round it was fantastic. Definitely want to come back to try their Aladdin fries and their chicken dishes!",My roommate and I rly like this place and we go there a lot. It has a lot of flavor and definitely up there for Mediterranean food in seattle,"TLDR: Best Greek/Mediterranean food on the Ave! I&apos;ve been here at least 15+ times.

My order: Gyro dish with beef + lamb, greek fries

Pros:
-Good portions
-Satisfies your drunchies, munchies, and quick eat cravings
-Flavor/taste is always consistent 
-Guys working are friendly and will help you with orders if it is your first time

Cons:
-Could be slow if they&apos;re super busy
-Fries will sometimes be cold if you go during off hours

Tips:
-Order the gyro dish or gyro combo, can&apos;t go wrong at all!","THE go-to place on the Ave.. especially when it&apos;s 2am and you need a bite while you&apos;re cramming for your final tomorrow.

Two items I would hands down recommend are the Aladdin Gyro and the Aladdin Fries.

Stuffed with beef, lamb, lettuce, tomatoes, the gyro falls nothing perfection. Every bite is the perfect ratio of pita bread, meat, and vegetables.

The Aladdin fries may seem overpriced (almost $10 for fries what??) but the quality and quantity of food will surprise you. Perfect fried fries with copious amounts of meat all drizzled with a signature white sauce is what brings me back every time.

Next time it&apos;s late at night and you&apos;re hungry but you can&apos;t decide what to eat, go to Aladdin&apos;s because they&apos;re most likely waiting to serve you Seattle&apos;s best gyro and fries.","Good food! Portion sizes are generous (especially for the price) and the food was yummy. Only con is that the food took an extremely long time to come out when there were only two other customers besides my group. 

Pro tip: Free water bottle if you pay in cash!","Aladdin&apos;s is good for breakfast, lunch, dinner, brunch, a study snack, drunk food, and anything else you can name. Living in Alabama, I do not get this luxury, but I always make sure I stop by when I visit Seattle. I remember once I was waiting in line and the guy in front of me drove 30 minutes from Bellevue at 12 am just to get Aladdin&apos;s. That shows you how good it is.

The food is amazing and so fresh. In the Aladdin gyro, they give you a hunk of sizzling meat. The veggies inside are so fresh and crisp, and the pita is warm and molds the filling. It&apos;s so flavorful because of the sauce and has all the right juices flowing down your mouth and hands. Make sure to grab a bunch of napkins. The Aladdin fries tho.. Every bite is perfection. The saltiness of the fries go well with the cheesiness of the feta and the lamb/beef just top it all off. The different textures from how soft the cheese is to the crispy skin of the fries just balance out so well. Perfect to share for two people. However, if you&apos;re really hungry, go for the whole thing.","I&apos;ve gone to this place for several years and I&apos;ve never been disappointed. If you like Gyro&apos;s, Falafal, or general Mediterranean type fare, this is a prime spot to check out. Its right on University Ave, up by the U-District.  

In particular, I&apos;ve always gotten the gyros or the Aladdin fries. The Tzatziki sauce at this place tastes a little better than some of the other gyro spots around which makes the Greek fries and Aladdin fries both really savory! The Greek fries are a nice upgrade to the normal fries but seriously, the Aladdin fries are like a meal all in themselves. Prices are all satisfactory and they typically give you a lot for your dollar! 

If you&apos;re looking for some gyros or falafel tonight, check them out!",Best gyros in Seattle must try if you have never had it. I recommend the Arabic shawarma or the aladin fries.,"Saw a sign about the place being voted the best gyro in town, so of course i have to try it. Well, not exactly, i ended getting a shawarma because i was trying to be fancy.   The shawarma came out fine. The pita came out perfectly with the right amount of crispiness and moisture. The lamb and beef was a tad salty, and required me to down a can of pop. Would have given it a four star if i had a beer to down with.","Tl;dr delicious food, perfect for ending a late night out although its a bit heavy/salty

Do yourself a favor and order the Aladdin fries. The fries and big and soak up the lamb and beef juice, sauce, and feta cheese. Adding hot sauce can add a nice kick to it. 

The atmosphere varies depending on what time you get here. It can be really chill and low key during the day, but have a line out the door at night. The food is consistently really good and I love their lamb and beef which is juicy and delicious. The food does get pretty salty, so make sure to get some water to take some breaks while eating. I&apos;ve had their gyros before which are really good, but the Aladdin fries are my go-to order and honestly I don&apos;t get tired of them. It&apos;s basically what everyone I know orders.

This place is on the ave so it caters to a college crowd. That being said for the amount and quality of food you get, its a pretty good value. The guys that work here are super fun and nice to talk to even when the night gets busy.","I have been hitting the drive through for years at this location. Actually coming here for over 30 years off and on? I am surprised it&apos;s still open but its a University Ave fixture.  Staff is always super friendly and food is great!  The location is a bit sketchy, especially when panhandlers are right outside but I guess it&apos;s part of this area&apos;s charm..   I have never been inside but again love the Chicken Ranch Sandwich and the Sausage Croissant Sandwich is always a winner. Also my new favorite, a iced Mocha Coffee so delicious ( and calorie filled I am sure )  it always wakes me up and makes me feel better. 

Yes its Fast Food, but never a issue and always served with a smile.","They don&apos;t give a shit, and never have. I don&apos;t give a shit about fast food, but hot-damn, this place blows.","Shitty ass service This location is the worst I&apos;ve ever seen Staff so stupid  always making mistakes. I&apos;m sick of this 
If you&apos;re reading this DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY DONT EVER COME HERE you will get disappointed and mad. 
Manager sucks  but I don&apos;t get how a person like that can be a manager of this shitty restaurant  also I can barely understand what she try to say every time.i hope they close their damn shitty restaurant","It is what you think it is. Delicious food that makes you feel kinda gross and really happy afterwards. I&apos;ve been going here for almost 20 years, since college. They are reliable, fast, never give any attitude even though they are serving a wide array of people in all sorts of condition day and night, and day and night, and day and night. I don&apos;t recall ever getting an order incorrectly, and there is at least a hurried half smile greeting me.","So I just stood in line to get tacos for 15 minutes, and the guy at the counter said they ran out of tacos. How do you prepare so poorly... I told him to cancel it and left empty handed FOR THE SECOND VISIT IN A ROW.
The first time there was nobody in line and I was forced to abandon my tacos at the 20 minute mark due to time constraints.
I&apos;m out $2.50 and have recieved negative 8 tacos so far. Bravo, well done guys. Not once was any compensation even mentioned. Lowered my rating to 2 stars, which is the lowest Jack in the Box can get simply because IF YOU CAN MANAGE TO EVEN GET FOOD FROM THE DUMP it&apos;s actually pretty good.
What an abysmal experience.",What did u expect. Just get drunker and u will experience a much better time. Lol this place be ballin at night lowkey tho,"I always get excited when I decide to eat Jack in the box because of their curly fries and spicy chicken sandwiches. However, when I got home with my food I looked in the bag and there were not a lot of whole fries, it seemed as though they gave me the last bit of the batch. My sandwich was tasty but relatively pretty dry. I would say just make sure, it meets your standards.","Wow! What a dump!!!

I ducked in here quickly, planning to grab a small bite to eat before going to the farmers market across the street. But first, I had to use the bathroom.

Eeeewww. You can usually tell much about the cleanliness and meticulousness of a restaurant in general and of its kitchen and staff by visiting the restrooms. What I saw at this location made me lose all desire to eat anything prepared at this location. Dirty. Run down. Disgusting. See photos.

Jack in the Box needs to tear this location down and start over. It&apos;s that bad.",I haven&apos;t seen bathrooms this bad since the 1980s gas station rest stops. The staff refuse to clean them. The staff acknowledged the level of filth. The bathrooms are going to spread disease. My camera isn&apos;t the best I didn&apos;t seem to catch the feces within the deep etchings and scrapings.,"We should be allowed to give 0 stars. The bathroom here is horrifying. There was a toilet seat cover stuck to the seat, but no dispenser in the bathroom. Urine everywhere. No toilet paper. Employee ambivalent. This place needs shut down","Advertised prices on Drive Thru sign do not match what is actually charged. 

Ordered a Sausage Breakfast Jack 
$2.99 Advertised 
$3.19 Charged ($3.51 after tax)","Just because you might have enjoyed eating somewhere as a child, doesn&apos;t mean it was ever a good place to eat. i had a sudden pang of nostalgia for my childhood monthly trips to Jack in the Box. We used to go to market, and maybe do some shopping, then my sister and I would pester my mom to take us for burgers.

I wish i kept that memory unsullied by the sharp stark light of the more discerning judgment of my adulthood. What a bad place to eat. There is nothing wrong with fast food (well...that&apos;s probably not true), but at least be clean, and friendly while we treat ourselves to some comfort food. It was hard to even open the bag after walking out of the place. There was trash everywhere, uncleaned spills and stains, the dispensers for napkins and such stood empty. This was all in view of the public. I can&apos;t imagine what it looked like in the kitchen.

I had one bite...that&apos;s all it took for the good memories of my youth to drift away to the soundtrack of the unsettling gurgles in my stomach.","I hope Jack in the Box closes their damn stores, seriously. I don&apos;t know how they are allowed to feed people this crap.

This location is fine and got our order right, unlike the shitshow over at Bellevue. Seems like an anomoly for this place, going by other yelp reviews though. 

Something is seriously wrong with this company. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s a regional thing because I&apos;ve only ever eaten at JITBs in Seattle but what they serve is fucked up. 

We got a spicy sriracha burger, stuffed jalapenos, fries, nacho curly fries, nugs, cheesecake, and a vanilla shake. 

Cheesecake was good because it&apos;s a pre-packaged item from a third-party supplier. 

Burger, jalapenos, fries, curlies, and nugs all tasted microwaved - ok, I don&apos;t love it but I eat microwave Totino&apos;s pizza bites and it&apos;s nbd. However, there must be something in the processing of JITB food that makes it so effing gross your body just flat out refuses to eat it.

Guys, I have NEVER in my life failed to polish off jalapeno bites, nugs, or fries til I got them from JITB. I eat garbage, too! 

I pretty much left over half my order uneaten. I had the munchies, too.

That vanilla shake was straight ice cream.

Look, it&apos;s not worth it. This is not only fast food but the effect it has on your body does not make it seem like it&apos;s anything anyone should be ingesting at all.",Decent quality food but is at a shady location and has bad customer service at the drive thru.,"Look, it&apos;s Jack-in-the-Box. Expectations are minimal. That being said, the University District JItB has reached a whole new level of unprofessional. Customers, What Are Those?!?!? Seriously, just find any quick-mart gas station in the area for more friendly staff and cleaner facilities.",I wish I could rate a place zero. For some reason management does not seem to train any staff properly and sometimes they pretend not to be working so that they don&apos;t have to help you. I order once sand which and ask for cheese and they&apos;ve gotten this wrong so many times.,"If I could give this location a zero I would, everytime I order it&apos;s the same guy who messes my order up everytime! Could possibly be one of the worst jack in the box&apos;s in the world","No idea why this place has questionable people in the vicinity all the time, but it does. 

I&apos;ve been wanting to try the croissant-doughnut of theirs for a while. For the first time in years, I went to Jack in the Box with a very clear purpose: deep fried badness. 

A little over a dollar for one hybrid snack. For a single order, I was surprised that it took about 5 minutes (as there weren&apos;t many people and I thought that they just needed to put it into a bag), but eventually got it.

Not what I was expecting.. no layers of croissant that I expected; a very squishy, small doughnut.

For the cost, the quality, and the size not delivering, I surmise that the rest of the Jack in the Box menu is of similar quality. As this area is somewhat &quot;harrowing,&quot; and I wasn&apos;t satisfied, I&apos;ll pass.","The tables are filthy and filled with drug addicts and homeless.

I&apos;ve personally seen:
* a guy taking food out of the trash with his bare hands and throwing it across the dining area on the floor for his unleashed pitbull to eat

* a guy spilling his drink everywhere and then purposely BLOWING SNOT all over the counters - an employee asked him to leave only AFTER another customer complained about him

* a woman repeatedly threatening to use her knife to CUT OPEN AN INFANT in a stroller who was there with his parents. the employees REFUSED to kick her out even after the parents complained

* a guy combing his beard and having a giant ball of gray hair fall out and land on the floor

* a COMPLETELY NAKED man come in screaming, banging on stuff, and trying to climb into the kitchen area - cops showed up TWENTY MINUTES later when he was already at the Safeway across the parking lot. My food was placed on the counter where the naked guy&apos;s butt was when he tried to get into the kitchen. That counter was wiped AFTER my food was placed there.

I could go on with these incidents.

Additionally, the posted hours are suggestions - they&apos;re never open when they say they are and they always close early.","worst place ever they don&apos;t have the red sauce for days now 
drive thru suck with a guy who will ask you your order 5 times after telling you give me a moment. You been repeating yourself like hell. 
no napinks in the back really drive thru","Great little place since it re opened. 

We got the chicken wings with sweet and spicy. Good wings but next time I would get Buffalo.

Also got the pretzel knots with jalape√±o dip. Honestly the pretzels were too good on their own to add the dip.

Lastly chips and quac another winner. Chips are warm, fresh salty and the guacamole is one of the best I have had a restaurant for a long time

Drinks have also seemed to improved 
We got a few beers and the beekeeper which we got two round of

They are being responsible with covid, definitely would recommend for apps and drinks for sure!","For a special belated birthday for myself and one of my staff, a couple of our other staff took us out to lunch at the Yard restaurant.  

There were some things that I actually like about the Yard:

Firstly, the parking was great. It was nice to be able to roll up and get a parking spot right at the building at the lunch rush hour.

Secondly, the look and feel of the exterior of the restaurant was really appealing. 

I like the fact that the bathrooms were gender neutral but were one person at a time spaces.

 Otherwise, the ambience of the restaurant was OK. And had sort of a rustic feel about it but nothing that made it special.

I was very cold in some spots inside but there were heat lamps above certain areas.  So, trying to find the ideal place to sit was challenging. 

They have more seating downstairs then they do upstairs however the booths downstairs are extremely tight. So larger individuals might not either fit or be very comfortable.

 Our hostess/wait person was efficient in seating us, discussing the menu, and taking our orders. 

The menu had a variety of appetizers,  salads, tacos,  and entrees but tying to get low carb options was not easy.  I was told we&apos;d have to pay more to get a taco on lettuce because we did not want the corn or flour shell.  OK, so that was really ridiculous. 

The food tasted great.  Everyone was happy with their selections.   I got carnitas taco over shredded cabbage and big thick bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers.   I would get both again.","Great ambiance, service was nothing to complain about, but I was pretty disappointed with the food. We got a veggie quesadilla, fish tacos, and the quinoa bowl with cod, and every dish seemed to lack flavor. Needed seasoning, salt, salsa, and more variety in texture. 

First, the quesadilla was hard to eat because everything just squished out of it as you bite in. I couldn&apos;t even tell what was inside because it all just kind of blended together. There was no distinct flavor (or flavors), and I&apos;m not even convinced there was cheese inside. I think it was just beans...? Honestly I couldn&apos;t tell. It was just kinda weird tasting, like when you eat something and don&apos;t know what it is.

Next, the fish tacos were OK, but seriously lacking in flavor. No sauce or flavorful salsa. Just bland fish with cabbage and a little pico. I requested salsa, which came in a tiny little container that was filled about 2 mm (I&apos;m serious) because it was apparently very spicy. I poured the whole 2mm on my taco and it was only mildly spicy, and also pretty flavorless. Hm... didn&apos;t want to wait for another 2mm serving and let the tacos get cold, so I just ate it as is. Meh. 

Then the quinoa bowl.... what a bummer. A bunch of random things just thrown into a bowl. No complementary flavors or textures. The beans were super cold and undercooked, almost like they came straight from the can, rinsed, then thrown into the bowl. I&apos;m serious. I think the bowl, with the fish for (+$8) came to like $24 or something. What a joke.... This bowl needed guac, salsa, maybe some sour cream, ANYthing to give it some flavor and enjoyable texture. It was just so random and thrown together.... extremely disappointing, especially for the high price tag. 

One thing I will say, however, is the house marg was absolutely delicious!!! I could order those all day long. 

So, overall, the service was good, our waiter was nice and (for the most part) attentive, the margaritas were bomb, but the food was a huge disappointment. I really wanted to like this place since it&apos;s so cute and the vibe is fun. But the food, especially for the price, was seriously a joke. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be back. :(","Been driving by this place for years, finally was treated to lunch by my dear partner who eats there often. Even in wiinter rain and inside only seating  I loved it. It&apos;s super casual, service is relaxed but just dandy. The food is amazing, we each ordered two tacos and then ordered another one/ its that good. The table next to us was having a taco salad- plenty to share.  I really wanted to add it to our order, food envy/ lust. I will be back- fresh, bright flavors, good prices, good bar, friendly, relaxed service. Just do it!","Cool vibe, friendly folks, great music (90s hip hop today)!
The food is pretty basic but decent, but the prices are outrageous. 
$8 for a &quot;tulip&quot; of cider? That&apos;s like 8 ounces, if that.
So I got two &quot;tulips&quot; of cider and a quesadilla, and after the tip it was $40. Yeeeaaaahhhhh.... Granted I live in South Seattle, and things are still pretty cheap down here (for now), but daaaaannnggggg.
I don&apos;t think I&apos;d ever go to this place if I didn&apos;t have friends that wanted me to meet them there. WAY too expensive for what you get, and spare me the &quot;everything&apos;s expensive in Seattle&quot; crap, because it&apos;s insane to pay that much for a modest lunch and a couple (tiny) drinks, even to Seattle standards.","walked in to grab a quick bite, the waitress who greeted us was unhappy and rude. My date and I were literally the only people eating there, the entire restaurant was empty on a Sunday. Even though the food was quality as we left we said thank you to that same bartender lady and she blatantly said nothing back. Will not be returning, that&apos;s for sure.","I really like this place.  I like the drinks, the food, the atmosphere, the outdoor seating area. It&apos;s just a great place all around.","Food was good, seemed like standard mexican fare to me, though. We sat outside, about 6pm on a Saturday and wasn&apos;t too busy.

I ordered 4 tacos, the tacos were good, not great but not awful. They were much spicier than I had anticipated and a little too spicy for my enjoyment, personally. We also ordered chips and guac, I think the portion of chips is tiny, especially if you&apos;re sharing between more than 2 people (which you usually are, you hardly ever order those for yourself, right?). Nothing big to complain about at this restaurant but there was also nothing that made it stand out. I&apos;d go back if someone in my party was dying to go here but I wouldn&apos;t suggest it over other eateries.","Had a great experience here with a group of friends for lunch. 

Enjoyed chips and guac/salsa to start, craft beers, and an assortment of entrees including quesadillas and tacos. Everything came to the table in a reasonable amount of time.

I got the adobada quesadilla which was flavorful and succulent, and priced fairly for the portion size. Everyone else loved their food as well.

BUT the real thing that made this place stand out? The waitress offered to split the chips and guac across 5 bills. On the receipt it literally said &quot;0.2 chips &amp; guac&quot;. Either technology has come a long way or other waitstaff have been lying for years that they can&apos;t split items this much.","I haven&apos;t had a bad meal here. The food is flavorful, the bartender is flexible and provides the drink you explain even if it&apos;s not on the menu, and the music overhead is  fun. We&apos;ve been here many times and have not been disappointed.","I originally went to this place pre corona and it was great. From good food, service and drinks I was very pleased. So when I saw the had take out I thought we would try it but we&apos;re extremely disappointed. The food was practically inedible. I spent 50$ for trash. Tacos and fries were so soggy It would make you gag. The online posted hours said they would be open, then person I talked to should have warned me that they were minutes from closing due to reduced corona hours. I would have rather had an update then be served/ paid for garbage. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll come back after restaurants open, if that&apos;s how the restaurant and staff operate then maybe try somewhere else.","Great space, (nicely socially distanced tables) but service needs to improve. We were a party of 3 and were seated promptly. We were also told upon seating that tables were limited to 90 mins. We ordered: queso and chips, 1 burger, 2 tacos and 1 drink. It took 50 minutes for our food to arrive. I asked our server for a side of pico to go with my now soggy tacos, which cost $5.00 each and the server forgot and I had to ask again. Funny enough, our bill came quickly. Good thing too, because we were about to go over the 90mins at our table. The house made chips were great but I&apos;m not sure we&apos;ll be back. Terrible 1st impression Yard Cafe, I really wanted to like you.","I went to The Yard Cafe to celebrate my friend birthday and we felt really bad ! The waitress was really rude with us. The place is amazing, I really liked there,  but I would like to ask for someone talk to her to be better/more professional next (all) time. 
Thank you .","Walked here for dinner on a recommendation while we were babysitting.  The weather was nice so all of the outdoor seating was taken so we ended up sitting just the other side if the wall that divided the restaurant area from the bar. 

Being on a bit of a street taco thing lately I went with the street tacos.  Nothing overly exciting and a little bit dry.  The children&apos;s menu was also a little too sophisticated for a two year old (and meals are not generally altered for him) They didn&apos;t have anything that wasn&apos;t too spicy for the little guy so he didn&apos;t really like anything on his plate.  We ended up picking things apart on all of our plates and playing the bite count game to get him to enough to eat.

I might go back if I was with just adults  but not a place I would go back to with a toddler","Loved this place! It was my first time coming here, but I had a great experience. 
I came here for Saturday brunch and ordered the Sunflower cocktail which was gin, lemon and champagne. Kind of like a take on French 75&apos;s, but it was so much lighter and just all around delicious. The menu is Mexican-inspired and I asked one of the owners (who was there) what inspired his menu. He said basically things he enjoyed eating and wanted to make for other - genius. 

i ordered the chilaquiles, which were delicious! it&apos;s a very generous serving of tortillas, layered with a tomatillo salsa verde, cheese, sour cream and two poached eggs on top. It usually has meat, but I ordered without. Almost everything on their menu can be made vegetarian by substituting for beans or just replacing with eggs, or taking it out all together. Definitely gets points for accommodating their herbivore friends.

The staff was so friendly, attentive and kept the drinks filled. 
Prices are fair as far as Seattle restaurants go, and parking is available outside with spots clearly marked for The yard. 

I would totally recommend this place!","This is the spot! Prefunk, large parties, hang out before going out! Hey beers and bullshit! 

If your looking to watch the Seahawks game (nothing else) this is the spot! Now your wondering why I said ONLY Seahawks because the female behind the bar ripped my head off when I asked to put on the game that needed to win in order for the Seahawks to advance but she said NOPE not changing it and it&apos;s all the way over there on that TV! Was she moving me? NOPE so that wasn&apos;t going to happen! 

We had another encounter with a women who smashed one of our friends drink on the table Because she didn&apos;t know what he ordered when she said another one and then put it in! It ended up being the wrong drink. She got pissed bc he didn&apos;t remember the name, biotch we don&apos;t have the names memorized like you, it&apos;s your job to know, not ours! I know I&apos;m being mean, but she was out right, NOT OK! I think me and my friend have a target on our back and they will never leave it down when we asked to watch the panthers game! Hahhaha 

Anywaysss it&apos;s not about that or them, they hire bad people or the people have bad attitudes. The food is pretty good, the beer selection is great and for a long day of shopping and hanging out downtown this is the spot to be. it&apos;s blocks from out home so we come here a lot!

Stop on it, call to make reservations if you can!","TL;DR: Yard, your service is sinking rapidly. Be better.

I love the Yard. I have lived in Greenwood for 4 years and this is an anchor to our community. However, something has changed: the service. I went in on my own for a snack and a drink and felt like a bother to the staff. I was not offered water or given a menu. When I did order food from memory, the waiter brought it over so sloppily that the salsa spilled all over the plate and table. No napkins and he left the pile of beer menus and coasters haphazardly on my table. Also, the music was so loud and depressing it bore a hole through my brain. Yard: you are amazing but man, what is this? Come on. Greenwood, we can do better.","Well... I forgot to take pictures as usual. 

Imagine a wooden atmosphere with sports on in the background and a semi-new age presentation. 

The food is ok. The chips and salsa are horrible. The chips taste like the homemade, dry, chip of the century--hello oil! The salsa is a three-fer with a verde, red, and pico selection. The pico is like any other pico, the red tastes like paper and hand sanitizer, the verde is pretty good. I got the Camarones a la macha. It was presented with the shrimp and the sauce(which tasted like mayo) and some cabbage on a big lettuce leaf. The corn tortillas were ok.. pretty hard and didn&apos;t curl right--rather crunchy. My friends got the quesadillas, they would have liked more shrimp and more spice. Overall, we had a good time because the atmosphere is pretty good and the service is quite good.","So my wife and I went for a Pick-up today. And the bartender with beard and a black mask was rude as hell. He first told us to wait outside because it&apos;s gonna take a few more minutes and we did. A few minutes later, it has reached to 5:56 pm when the app says it will be ready. But we waited a few more minutes because we were not in any rush and we didn&apos;t want the workers to feel being pushed. Then we went in again around 6 o&apos;clock. And the second time we came in the waitress came to us and ask if we Needed any help. I told her we are here to pick up and she directed me to the bar again. As soon as The bartender saw us at the bar desk again he felt really unhappy and he came to us and said next time we had to wait outside until they&apos;re ready. First of all the app already said you&apos;re ready it&apos;s five minutes past when you would&apos;ve been ready. And if you&apos;re bringing things outside to us we would love to stay outside. We gave you a few more minutes after 5:56 pm and we assumed that it&apos;s ready to go. Second of all, we came to the bar for the 2nd time because your waitress directed us to. The bartender was extremely rude to us, and we definitely would not visit again.",Feel in love here. Food is great. You can bring your dog and sit outside of its a nice day.,"I&apos;m so surprised I hadn&apos;t written a review for this place yet. This place is SOOO GOOD. It&apos;s like a Vietnamese chipotle but like the meats are so juicy and delicious! I took my friend who&apos;s huge on yummy cheap eats here and I think I definitely changed his life LOL. During covid, I felt like a piece of me was missing because I hadn&apos;t had sizzle and crunch for a few months. I craved it but couldn&apos;t justify making the trek all the way to u district without a car. Ever since I got my car, I&apos;ve been going at least once a week. Please try the house pork plate and get all the toppings. It is packed FULL of so much food and so worth the price. You might be able to eat it for two meals unless you eat a lot like I do haha.

They have a sizzle and crunch in SLU (I&apos;d go there all the time during lunch) but I think it&apos;s been closed for now because of covid times. I&apos;m really hoping they open back up soon so I don&apos;t have to keep driving up just to get it!","My boyfriend and I really love this place even though it&apos;s a bit of a far drive from where we live. Their flavors are delicious and it&apos;s great that we get to choose what we want to go into the bowl. My boyfriend usually gets a chicken rice bowl and I like the pork rice bowl. They give a great amount of food, I usually only eat half and save the other half for later. The service is fast since everything is already cooked and available. The staff is friendly, it was a little hard to hear because of the barrier and the masks but we worked through it. I hope to be able to dine in soon because it&apos;s a 25 minute drive from our house so it would be nice to enjoy the hot meal right away. Until then, it&apos;s still a great place for takeout!",The pork belly rice bowel is on point. I found the place quite clean and convenient for something to go during COVID. It wasn&apos;t crowded at all when I walked in for take out. I&apos;d recommend this!!,"What attracted me to this place was the smell of grilled meat in the air when I was walking around the Ave. I was like I gotta try this place because it smelled really good. I checked the menu and they had a few items on the menu which consists of almost the same ingredients. 

Basically, there&apos;s like three main items, you can get a Banh Mi sandwich and grilled meat with like rice/salad. So I ordered a Banh Mi Sandwich -- coming from the SGV, there are many great Banh Mi sandwiches here so I got to compare the two.

So when you go inside, the way you order is basically chipotle style. You pick the style you want and then you select the ingredients inside. 

After the staff made my sandwich, I had to wait for someone else&apos;s sandwich to be made. I don&apos;t know why the staff did that since literally he could have just helped me check out but instead I am waiting in front of the cash register while my sandwich is getting cold.

So the quality of the sandwich is pretty meh and bland. Presentation isn&apos;t bad, but it&apos;s weird that it&apos;s bland and spicy, that&apos;s about it. The meat doesn&apos;t have a strong taste and it&apos;s supposed to be lemon flavored.

Aside from the mediocre food and the unnecessary waiting in front of the cash register, I would pass this place. Wouldn&apos;t recommend.","Setting: 
You order food Chipotle-style, starting with the type of carbohydrate (rice or sandwich), meat, then vegetables. You can get food pretty quickly although the line can build up during peak eating hours. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side with limited seating, similar to a small Chipotle. It is definitely not upscale; it is a place to get cheap, quick awesome food. 

Food: 
The food is why I keep coming back here. It&apos;s hard to go wrong with anything that you get. I generally get a rice bowl with various meats. All of the meat options including the pork belly, chicken, pork chop, and beef are all great. I usually will do 50/50 of two different meats. I pretty much get all of the vegetables and ask for the fish sauce and green sauce on the side so I can control the amount of sauce that I use. 

Value: 
For roughly $10-$11, you get a lot of food. You can easily turn it into two meals if you aren&apos;t eating to absolutely stuff yourself. Because it isn&apos;t a sit-down restaurant and you&apos;re not necessarily paying tip, it is one of the higher value meals in Seattle. 

Service: 
The servers are generally pretty generous with portions and allow you to customize your order as necessary. I never really had an issue with the service here and I&apos;ve been here over 10 times. The restaurant itself is not super clean but that&apos;s probably my only real complaint. 

Other: This is my husband and I&apos;s go to place when we want an excellent, satisfying, cheaper meal.","The pork banh mi was amazing! I got a fried egg on top. One of the best I&apos;ve ever had! My friend got the pork belly rice bowl and it was to die for, I&apos;m going back for that! Their sauces are fantastic and they&apos;re very friendly.  Seriously one of the best I&apos;ve ever had!!!","Note that Sizzle and Crunch IS OPEN for TAKEOUT during COVID! 

I came here at noon (the earliest they opened) with my friend. We were the first ones in line and so service was quick.

I ordered a rice bowl with half salad and half rice and half tofu and half chicken. I also got fried egg and all toppings except for jalape√±os because I wasn&apos;t feeling spicy that day. The server was very generous with his portions- maybe too generous because the poor guy at the end of the assembly line struggled to close the lid on mine! My total came out to around $11.

My rice bowl was very fresh and tasty and I love that you can customize it to your liking. I wish the server had been a little more generous with the green sauce though (I&apos;m not entirely sure what&apos;s in it, but it&apos;s like a spinach or pesto aioli). My egg was perfectly fried and I was able to mix the yolk into the rest of my bowl.

All servers were wearing masks and gloves. They also have a plastic barrier between you and the server, but they have not installed a plastic shield near the cash register. I also noticed that while all employees were wearing the proper safety gear, the cook was not wearing his mask over his nose and therefore was wearing it improperly. Sizzle additionally has an Okay health rating, but they&apos;ve had that rating since even before COVID. I&apos;m just glad it no longer has a Needs to Improve rating.

Overall: 4/5 for food, 5/5 for service, 3/5 for health and safety measures","Look. It really is a Vietnamese Chipotle. 

I went to visit my friend in Seattle back in 2018 after he just started school at UW and while I looked up places to get food at, I didn&apos;t know how far things were, and since I&apos;ve never been to Seattle and my friend is in school here, I figured i&apos;d just let him take the reigns. Sometimes it&apos;s a good idea. Well mostly.

Anyway he suggested Vietnamese food, more specifically Sizzle &amp; Crunch. Now I was about to ream him out as I was going to say I didn&apos;t fly to Seattle to have a bowl of pho that is similar to what&apos;s available in the bay, but he pointed out we should get something that&apos;s relatively quick, his school mate would be joining, and it&apos;s like a Vietnamese Chipotle.

That last part was what piqued my interest. Like I&apos;ll only eat Chipotle on a whim if I wanted something quick and consistent. And if I felt like giving them the look of acknowledgement when they ask me if I knew guac is extra. Yes, I think everyone knows. *queue image of Leonardo DiCaprio throwing money off the boat in The Wolf of Wall Street*

We get in, I see the menu and I&apos;m excited, get a rice bowl and a banh mi? Yes, sign me up. But my friend stepped in and said it was a lot of food. Luckily I agreed cause that bowl was huge. Like yuuuge.

Rice bowl with lettuce, half beef, half chicken, sunny side up egg, pickled daikon/carrot, onion, green onion, and green onion aioli coupled with the fish sauce (can ask for two ;), is just an absolutely wonderful combination of ingredients. Yes the rice, lettuce, and meat resembles Chipotle, but the meat is definitely not seasoned like them.

You get the rich vietnames flavors of the meat, with the broken rice, rich green onion aioli and the pickled daikon and carrot to cut through the fat? Yes. sign me up.

I didn&apos;t get to go back in 2019, but i did keep mentioning to my friend, and when i visited again earlier in February, i insisted that we go back. Why? Cause it was that good. And it was just as good as I remembered.

I for one cannot wait to go back.",We went in this evening and got the grilled pork and grilled chicken salads - both salads were absolutely phenomenal. We&apos;ll be back.,"I came here when they first opened a few years ago and I was not a fan. Their bread was so crunchy it cut my mouth.

Fast forward to earlier this week and I had a much better experience!

There was a line but it moved quickly and the staff was so friendly!

I ordered a grilled pork banh mi with an egg. The cost was just a little over 7 dollars with tip. 

The sandwich was much better this time! The bread was a bit softer but not soggy. It was stuffed with meat, veggies and the egg of course. It was also just huge! 

I was kind of full after the first half but fatty me ate the second half too. I almost regretted that b/c I was sooooo full afterwards.

Overall, I would definitely come back for a sandwich and to try a rice bowl again. This place is fast, cheap and convenient. Only downfall is their food safety rating BUT hopefully that will go up in the future!","Known as the Vietnamse Chipotle or &apos;that one place you eat at even though their health rating is always sad&apos;, Sizzle and Crunch is a not-so-secret favorite among UW students. With choices of what carb, what meat, what sides, and what sauces you want, it greats customizable fun with vibrant colors and flavor. By far, I always prefer this over Chipotle. Lots of veggies. Plus, it is pretty cheap, and good for two meals. 

My personal favorite is the beef rice bowl with an egg and extra green onion aioli because that sauce perfectly seals the deal!","Sizzle &amp; Crunch was best known on campus for hiding its food safety rating, and then getting in trouble for it, but no one really seemed to care. The lunch and dinner rush was still always there, and the food remained delicious. 

AMBIANCE
Think Vietnamese Chipotle. It&apos;s pretty standard fare in here. It can get crowded during the lunch and dinner rush, so I&apos;d suggest takeout then. The tables can get a little gross if no one comes by to clean them.

FOOD
The meats here are really what shine. Each cut is pretty flavorful and juicy. I always go with a chicken rice bowl with an egg, but you can&apos;t really go wrong here. Load up on the veggies. They&apos;re free. The fish sauce is also definitely a must over the soy.

OVERALL
Food&apos;s great, it&apos;s super affordable, the only downside is that food safety may be a concern. But a B-rating just stands for Bettertasting, right?","This is pretty much a Chipotle-style eatery for Vietnamese food in either rice/salad bowl or banh mi sandwich form. Seem to be a popular place during lunch, but they&apos;re very efficient so don&apos;t let the lines deter you. You pretty much pick your base (bowl, sandwich, salad) and your protein (pork, chicken, beef, tofu) followed by various toppings and veggies as well as soy sauce or fish sauce. I highly recommend adding an egg although it does cost extra ($0.65). I chose a salad bowl with grilled chicken ($8.58) and enjoyed it very much. It was filling, tasty, and reasonably priced.

Sizzle &amp; Crunch is not that big of a joint so there&apos;s limited seating. The cleanliness was a bit questionable, but I&apos;d still come back for lunch if I find myself at UW again.","This place is very close to university with great food options. It&apos;s more like Chipotle style but with different base options. I didn&apos;t had anything like that before so might take some time to develop that taste but overall it was healthy and good.

They have space and menu to cater students mostly who are on the run but they do take orders online and you can pick up if you want. 

The most important thing is everything they offer is extremely FRESH. The pricing is similar to chipotle or subway but with healthy food options.

All n all this a worth going place if you are in Udistrict and looking for something healthy to eat.","I would describe Sizzle &amp; Crunch as a Chipotle, but a Vietnamese version if that makes sense. 

Vietnamese broken rice dish has been my favorite Vietnamese dish ever since I was young. I&apos;ve only ever had this dish either in Orange County or homemade by my mother. Switching from an omnivore diet to a pescatarian diet, it was harder to find a place that served this dish to my liking besides my home. Needless to say, my expectations were high. 

I ordered the rice bowl with tofu, a fried egg, cilantro aioli, cilantro, tomatoes, romaine lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, and green onion oil. Despite not being quite a traditional Vietnamese broken rice dish with an egg meatloaf, shredded pork skin, and/or a shrimp cake, I really enjoyed the rice bowl. With tofu dishes, sometimes the tofu is too hard and dry, but their tofu was really soft and marinated well. I also really like both their soy sauce and fish sauce. The soy sauce is not overly salty. It has a sweetness to it. The same can be said about the fish sauce. I really like that their rice bowls balance carbs, protein, and vegetables. It makes me feel that I am eating a balanced meal. In my opinion, the portion size is pretty big so for $10, I am basically getting two meals.

For the rice bowls, you choose your grain (white rice or brown rice), protein (pork, beef, chicken, tofu), and veggies (carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, jalapenos, cilantro, cilantro aioli, and romaine lettuce). There is no limit for how much veggies you want. Then, you can choose either soy sauce or fish sauce. 

Regarding the atmosphere, this location is pretty small. It has a small seating area. Not a good place for large groups. However, all the times that I&apos;ve been here, there aren&apos;t many people seating so if you did want to dine in, you definitely could. 

This place is my go-to when I am craving Vietnamese food!","Chipotle style vietnamese rice dishs.
Grilled pork rice plate w/ egg - just gonna start out by saying the extra fish sauce is paramount. It gives the dish so much dimension when doused in that delicious fish sauce. I got the house special plate in the past but realized that my favorite meat was the grilled pork over the braised beef. The meat is tender and the vegetables are fresh. We usually get extra green onions and pickled carrots.","Troi oi, this is like the Vietnamese version of Chipotle, except probably healthier considering it&apos;s Asian cuisine. I&apos;m Vietnamese and I can vouch for it having authentic flavors. Super duper easy concept, it&apos;s quick &amp; easy with reasonable pricing.  

You order at the counter and it&apos;s pretty much self service. You pick your base; rice/noodle bowl, salad, or banh mi. I got the rice because it&apos;s kind of rare to find broken rice anywhere and when you find something rare, you don&apos;t let it go. Next is the selection of protein which you can also add an egg. You just go through the assemble line adding whatever toppings of fresh veggies that you want. At the end, they ask if you want fish sauce or soy sauce which if you want the full Vietnamese experience, get the fish sauce. 

Why can&apos;t you come to Bellevue?! I drove all the way from there to University district to finally try this spot because it&apos;s brilliant. It&apos;s great for lunch being affordable with plenty of food, like my food was spilling out of the bowl, sorry next time I won&apos;t be so greedy and get so much toppings.

Tell me about your experience if you&apos;ve been here or is going to after reading this review:)",Really like their sandwiches and bowls -- can&apos;t go wrong with any of them. Nice to get a bowl where you customize it yourself or just a banh mi that is set for you. Would recommend getting the pork belly!,"Great banh mi, but i guess this qould be a gourmet banh mi compared to the more traditional fare.  Flavor was great and portion was pwrfect!","If you&apos;re looking for something filling, yet light Sizzle &amp; Crunch is your spot! I&apos;ve been here twice around lunch time, and it&apos;s never been super busy. When you order, you have a choice of a rice bowl, salad, bowl and banh mi or one of their specialty rice bowls/bahn mis. Then you can pick a meat of your choice (chicken, pork, beef, tofu). After, you can choose from a variety of toppings including an egg for an extra cost. Finally, you can add fish sauce or soy sauce on the side. I usually put everything in my rice bowl with fish sauce. Off to the side, there&apos;s bottle of sriracha to add to your meal.  

First time I was here I got the Grilled Pork Bahn Mi. The bread and ingredients were super fresh, but for some reason the pork tasted like kerosene. That flavor made it very difficult to finish the sandwich. 

Second time, I got the Grilled Chicken Rice Bowl and it was absolutely delicious. Normally, they give enough food that I can save the other half for later. 

Overall, Sizzle &amp; Crunch is a great fast casual place to fill you up with fresh ingredients. The only down side is that the meats are hit or miss.","Since Covid parameters my husband and I have not been able to really go out for our date nights; Joey is one of our favorites that we have really tried to reserve for when it&apos;s safe to allow our little one to stay at home with a sitter and we go out without children. Joey not only has great cocktails and food but the ambiance makes you want to sit, order another drink or coffee, and just enjoy the company you&apos;re in. 

We were in the area and ordered take out, which was prepared fairly quickly. We also selected a few of the prepare at home items from the meal kit selection. I enjoy eating out and wasn&apos;t too excited about preparing anything at home; BUT the meal kits were actually really easy and of course extremely fresh; yielding us to order an entire meal kit next time . 

If you&apos;re in the mood for a large variety of food prepared with fresh in season vegetables, and really great cocktails I highly recommend Joey.","Apparently a Canadian chain, and while chains are typically known for high prices and poor quality (looking at majority of American chains), this is certainly not the case here. Well, high prices might be applicable, but it really did come with quality. Make good use of happy hour though, which apparently runs until 6pm.

Reservations are recommended though not required, as we last minute walked in and they were more than welcome to seat us with quite a few open tables. I ordered the steak frites off the happy hour menu, which tasted delicious. Some places just don&apos;t ask what rarity you want for the steak frites and just default it as well done, so this already is a good step. The dish itself is not terribly filling, which is great, as they don&apos;t overload the dish with salt and oil. It was a full yet satisfying meal, and the steak, although not steakhouse quality, is still really juicy and well seasoned. 

Service was also phenomenal, as they refill waters frequently and checked up on us regularly. The outdoor patio felt like dining in during normal times, which is great, and there is heating to make it enjoyable.

Overall, I&apos;d recommend this place, despite the fact that it is a chain restaurant.","I&apos;ve always enjoyed going to Joey&apos;s Kitchen for a late night cocktail. This evening me and friends decided to sit down for a dinner together and the experience was especially up-to-par! Natalie was a bomb waitress. She was super attentive and really went the extra few steps to make our dinner enjoyable.

They really did a great job with the heated patio. Super comfortable and spacious. Perfect for a hot toddy! I want to highlight the pecan pie! O.M.G. it was out of this world! We even debated on ordering a second one :O!

Also, Natalie, I know you mentioned that you read Yelp reviews at work. So, thanks for charging my phone when you heard it went dead just as I was trying to pull up the QR code! An exemplary example of one of your many skills to anticipate guest needs! :D","I used to love Joey&apos;s, and maybe my palette has changed, but some really big misses. 
Let&apos;s start with the good... the outdoor tent was comfortably heated and felt like good vibes on a sunny day. 
We got the Szechuan lettuce wraps, and that was the one decent thing. The tofu was excellently crispy BUT there was too much sugar in the sauce, which made us both happy it was only an appetizer. 
I got the Korean fried cauliflower rice bowl, which was bad. I don&apos;t know how you can call it Korean flavored, it was basically like a slightly spicy syrup. Disgustingly sweet that I couldn&apos;t finish the bowl. The Kimchi in it was decent, and that was where the good ended. The other veggies in the bowl didn&apos;t add to it and should have been seasoned. 
My fianc√© had the Butchers sandwich. Again, somehow they over-sugared the sandwich and the fries had a funk... like they&apos;d been cooked in oil that had been used way too many times for a million different things. 

The service was meh, kind of ok, inconsistent, and unintuitive. 

For all that, our lunch was $75. So yeah. Skip it and try one of the better restaurants in UVillage","I am sad writing this review.
Me and my husband went to the restaurant and waited 45 minutes for a table. We totally understand the wait. The host was very nice and friendly. No complaint there.

Then we finally get a table. We get a big family table for two of us and we requested for a booth if available. The waitress who was assigned to help us was not very happy with our request (or was tired???!!!). She cam back to us with an answer that we can&apos;t move to a booth since nothing else is available and her response wasn&apos;t friendly at all. Fine, we understand, she was probably tired!

We eat dinner, food was OK, Sangria was OK..so far all were OK so we decided to quickly finish out food and leave asap. Oh.. the Italian donuts were good. We were expecting them warm though! Anyways, We weren&apos;t feeling very well on that big table, so wasn&apos;t enjoying our time there either. When we ordered our Steak and Lobster Ravioli the waitress asked us -what type of steak would you like? nYC, sirloin..etc... 
My husband randomly said NYC steak only because she asked. We were fine with whatever it was on the menu, honestly we didn&apos;t even ask for any options! 

The waitress brings the bill and we noticed we were charged higher for our Steak and Lobster Ravioli. My husband was iffy but he still pays for it. Then I call the waitress again and ask for the explanation. She says &apos;Oh, that&apos;s because you took a NYC steak instead of a Sirloin steak&apos;! 
We go to so many restaurants and everywhere it&apos;s common to let the customer know if a food is going to cost more for any changes than what it is on the menu. We didn&apos;t know that we will have to pay extra. We would pay anyway if we knew but we must have been told! 

It was a bummer. I hope the restaurant will fix such service quality and we will be able to go there again to get a good service with good food.",This spot is serving to go food but I would say not to order from here. Food is overpriced and you don&apos;t get what you pay for. I ordered the ahi tuna salad and it was very small portion size for $22.00 that we paid for. The sliders were also very expensive and not worth it. You can get a hamburger at shake shack for half the amount and a good decent hamburger. People pay for experience and ambiance but during these times where most people can&apos;t eat indoors you are not getting the experience. I would save the money and go to a less expensive restaurant for a meal to go. THIS PLACE IS WAY OVERPRICED and the food gets smaller and smaller and they keep charging more and more. Check the picture below as you can see you get 10 pieces of lettuce and ahi tuna for $22.,"First off, I love Canada, especially the Vancouver area. This restaurant felt like I was in downtown Vancouver again which is what dreams are made of right now. This is a Canadian chain which you can just tell, probably why I loved it so much. 

My wife and I had a covid safe shopping trip at University Village and stopped in for lunch. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table which was totally fine since we walked across the street to the Amazon bookstore. We ended up being sat at a huge booth which felt very covid safe since there were actual dividers between the tables and we were far away from the server when she came to the table. 

We each got drinks, I got some run drink which was so tasty! My wife got a old fashion which was also amazing. I got the chicken sandwich and my wife got a tofu bowl. Tasty, fresh and we ate it all. 

We will be going out of our way to get back here. We miss Canada so much and this felt like a little slice of the perfect moments we have spent in Vancouver and Whistler.","I&apos;m so eternally frustrated by this restaurant. Their food is very good, and this is the blasted reason why we keep coming back. We have eaten here more than 10 times. Every single time there is some problem, whether in-person or takeout. Typically when we would dine-in, it was service issues paired with cold or very late food. We also discovered they do not correctly list meal ingredients; in particular, their &quot;loaded&quot; mashed potatoes come with bacon, something that is important to list as many people don&apos;t eat pork. We have had this problem, complained twice, and no change was ever made to the menu even until now. 

Since the pandemic, we have had two issues with takeout orders where the restaurant markedly gave us less than what we paid for. Last time, I ordered a market salad that, at the time, was described as having grapes, corn, and nuts, and did not come with any of those things.

Tonight was even more annoying. My husband ordered a steak that was supposed to be 7oz. When we got it home, it looked quite small, so I decided to weigh it. It was just over 5oz. For a $30 steak. It was also undercooked from what he ordered. For a higher end restaurant, Joey&apos;s consistent trickery and failure to deliver what they  claim to be selling is terrible.

We are so torn about this place. Their food is really good, and we haven&apos;t found a comparable substitute. Their chicken wings, steak, salmon, salads, drinks, and chocolate lava cake are all tasty. But we are so frustrated by the constant issues that whenever we cave in and go there or order, we have to prepare ourselves not to get upset about the inevitable problems we will encounter. I wish they would get it together!!","Absolutely loved this place!! My family raves about this place like no other so I decided to try it out! Hard to compare anywhere to Joeys but if I had to think of something, I would compare it to a much nicer and upscale version of CPK. The menu has everything you could think of, from American to Korean to Italian to Japanese to Indian...truly something for everyone! You This restaurant is super close to UW and is surrounded by tons of shops! My advice would be to get there early and roam the shops -- there&apos;s bound to be a place that you want to pop into! 

My mom and I arrived at Joeys and were seated right away! We ordered the watermelon drink...so refreshing and delightful on a summer day. Highly recommend trying it out! We both got doubles and man those were good. 

My brother walked over from UW and we ordered the tuna avocado roll + hibachi wings from the app menu. Both were amazing, perfect proportions and ratio of ingredients. I usually am not a wings fan, especially dry rub wings, but I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty these were + the ranch was yummy (and I am a ranch snob haha). 

For dinner, my mom and I split the roasted peanut curry noodles (subbed prawns with chicken), and my brother got a cali chicken sandwich. Both were flavorful and perfect quantities. The fries are especially crispy so if you have a chance to get them as a side, go for it!

Highly recommend this place to both locals and visitors. I really enjoyed everything about this place -- from the service to the drinks to the food to the atmosphere -- right up my alley!!","The sauces taste delicious, the dips, the dressings, I give 5 stars!!! I was pleased with the unique flavors. There attentiveness to the front of house and pick up area was also great. I think the location of this place is also more than good for all kinds of people. Parking lot(s) is handy for those who can&apos;t walk far. Outside seating is also some of the best, looks comfortable and also looks like they have heaters.

What this place did unfortunately get wrong was the time pick up, while I must compliment the attentiveness  (we had like 8 wait staff check on us) the food we ordered was not ready when we came, and we had to wait for awhile. I also ended up having an upset stomach which could have been because of the richness of the food that maybe I wasn&apos;t use to?","Truffle Fries + Mashed Potato Eggrolls: Wished these items came out first. All of our food came out at once so it was hard to balance each of the dishes together. These appetizers were crispy and hot! Fries were immaculate and perfect amount of seasoning. Couldn&apos;t really taste the truffle which was a little disappointing but it still turned out amazing. The mashed potato egg rolls are always my #1 favorite on the menu. It has a nice crunch until you get to the mashed potatoes. There was bacon, cheese, sour cream , and small shreds of green onion. 

Main Entree: Spaghetti (forgot the second part of the name). For some reason all of our entrees came out very cold. I feel like it would&apos;ve tasted better if it came out tasting hot or warm. It just tasted like an average spaghetti dish. Everything was just cold and I wasn&apos;t enjoying it at all. The texture of the noodles was a little hard. It had mini tomato pieces that added some flavor since the pasta tasted bland. 

Margarita: This was delicious! They gave us the wrong drink at first so we had to wait for another one and it took awhile so it made us not want to drink it anymore. Was super strong and does the job. 

Service: 10/10! everyone was friendly to us. Thanks to our server dealing with us and accommodating tables next to each other since we had a big group. This is the only Joeys I&apos;ve been to that had great customer service!","First, I was happy to find out they have outdoor seatings. But it was a little too cold to dine in this Seattle weather around 50 degrees even with their heating on. The wait was not too bad. It was about 45 minutes for Saturday dinner. Make sure to bundle up if you are dining at the patio. 

My food was disappointing. I got the seared salmon sushi and the taste was so so and the portion was tiny. I am pretty petite (just over 100 lbs) and I was still hungry after eating this. The sushi was not under appetizers and costed over $16 so I was expecting better quality and size. I honestly think getting one of those premade sushi packages from the whole foods would be more satisfying. My friend seemed like ok with his food though. Maybe I ordered a wrong thing. Do not order their sushi.","I went there last Friday and it was horrible service. I ordered the farmers salad and fries and it took an hour to come. I had also ordered a meal to go and the server came out with that before our food. She didn&apos;t even realize we hadn&apos;t ate our actual meal. We asked for a the fries to come out first before the salad and they came our after. They were cold and clearly they had forgot about us. The server didn&apos;t apologize and just said oh let me take a look in the back to see where your food is. It&apos;s actually pretty disappointed to spend about 70 dollars and not even be offered something to be taken care of the bill since it took over and hour. I would expect better customer service. The sad part about this is that they weren&apos;t even that busy, If they were I would totally understand and probably not even be writing this review. Sadly I love Joeys food but probably won&apos;t ever go back to this location.","Came here for a quick happy hour with a couple of friends before going to a wedding nearby... Ahh, the times of being able to dine in and gather socially. My favorite pastime. 

Seeing how I can&apos;t drink right now, I was just focused on the food. So many items on their happy hour menu made it hard for me to choose. I wasn&apos;t super hungry, so I ended up going with the Sliders Royale. 

My husband got an Old Fashioned (I believe it was Woodford) and he enjoyed it.

The Sliders Royale were decent. I feel like they could&apos;ve used a little more sauce because they were a tad dry, but other than that, they were good and the perfect little snack to tide me over.

Service was good and the restaurant itself was nice, like most Joey&apos;s. Good for meeting with friends or for a casual date.

If you&apos;re looking to try Joey these days, they offer delivery and curbside pickup.",This place is my favorite! I&apos;ve never had a bad dish here and the service is beyond amazing! Please have the tuna poke. It&apos;s my favorite hands down!!!,"One of the best restaurants restaurants I&apos;ve ever visited, or have visited over and over was Yummy Sushi in Las Vegas before the owner opened Kame.  In fact, it feels like any restaurant would qualify as best just as long as they had a revolving menu or specials so I can try something different every visit.  

Anyway, I came to Joey Kitchen at University Village and not only do the staff always look like they can model at your favorite clothing store or walk the catwalk, but I always see a new dish somewhere on the menu.  Thankfully I have tried many many many dishes in the past and even if I don&apos;t like what I picked, I can move on and say I&apos;ve had way more satisfying dishes here than not.

The last dish I had, the steak and sushi for $30, was my very least favorite dish I ever had here.  The steak was drowning in the soup, I had to prop it up some just to take the picture showing some steak.  But hey if that&apos;s how they serve, no fault on them, I still love this place.","I&apos;ll start with the simple fact that this place is popular and super packed all the time. Weeknights, weekend, any time! When we got there they gave us the estimated amount of time we would have to wait and it was almost double. It went from 20 to 40 minutes and there were only two of us and we even volunteered to sit in the bar seating if that was easier and quicker. 
When we sat down, our waitress was not knowledgable about the bar and didn&apos;t know what they had and didn&apos;t have. The best thing we had was the sushi cones. They were just unique and tasty. The steak was an upgrade and basically flavorless. It was kinda strange!","Went here a week or so ago and really liked the atmosphere it felt like things were getting back to normal, of course all staff wore masks And used effective cleaning techniques and they were open until 11!","Joeys always has excellent food, a bit on the pricer side, but the reason I am giving this three starts is because all the times that I have been here I am met with such attitude from the waitresses. Very passive aggressive when asked anything of them that might be a bit out of the way. And look I get it, times are tough right now but they just always seem to be on edge.","Dropped in to Joey for a Christmas shopping lunch and it was good. My first time there and the staff was great and attentive and the food was great. They have a great bar and a large dining area. One thing to note, the Nachos are amazing. Not traditional by any means but fantastic. 

Prices are a bit high but well worth the service and food. If you are in the area, give it a shot.","Move over Pacific Inn, you got competition up the street...
This will be my new neighborhood hangout - best clam chowder I&apos;ve ever had in Seattle, with lots of bacon and clams. Great IPA selection, and even had a grappa after dinner.
The Gumbo is perfect, with the roux just right and even okra - very authentic, with nice portions of chicken, sausage, and shrimp....
Staff is friendly and service is spot on.
Kudo&apos;s 36 Stone - welcome to the Seattle eating scene...","A nice bar on Stone Way with well priced food and drinks. I came in with three friends the other night and ordered a handful of drinks and a few plates of food, and I personally had the pork tacos. Without the salsa on the side the meat was pretty dry, but overall the dish had good flavor. My friends ordered the dumplings and really liked them - and I thought the presentation was fun/nice.

The bartender was our sever and she was great! She was attentive even though she has the entire restaurant and bar to manage, and she explained several drinks for us when we had questions.

I would come back!","Came here on a Tuesday evening with friends, and the place was so empty. We were skeptical at first, as it seemed like there wasn&apos;t any staff either, but we were greeted by the person behind the bar. She ended up seating us, taking our drink and food order, and bringing out our food! I&apos;m not sure if she was bar tending that night too, which is entirely possible since it was empty, but she was awesome taking care of everything! They were out of a beer we had ordered, and she came back with a suggestion that was similar to what we ordered. She was super friendly with explaining her beer choice. The food was also very delicious. I would highly recommend the Korean BBQ wings as a starter!","Walking in, I was a little underimpressed. The place was pretty empty and seemed like your regular run of the mill bar, with the neon lights and plastic booth seating and everything. I set my expectations aside and quickly warmed up to the place though. We didn&apos;t try any of the food (sadly, we&apos;d just eaten) but we&apos;ll definitely be back because it looked and smelled delicious. The drink prices are hard to beat and they have a good variety. Overall, four stars!","We came here for happy hour on 4th of july.
They make a mean bloody mary! the fries with alioli were also amazing! The pork dumplings coooould improve which is why I only gave them 4 stars!
Their moscow mule was great too!","Stopped in here for a meal coming back from downtown on a bus, weeknight outing. This was open later than most places in the Fremont-Wallingford area and right on the 62 route. Service was slow and the place mostly empty but the Cuban sandwich was good. Caution it&apos;s a pretty big meal but delicious in the way that keeps you chowing towards regret. Wine list is short but acceptable and I really appreciate that an Albari√±o is available since that&apos;s what a Cuban sandwich wants.",They have the best happy hour get beer and a shot for 5 bucks where can you get that deal specially in this city it is a cheap  can of beer  The shots worth more than that Most the people there live the neighborhood so definitely a local spot my bro seems to know most of them so they me me  Feel like one of them Bartender is cool talked with him for a bit now i Didn&apos;t try the food though It looked really good  maybe next time  Another great place in Fremont,"Buildings, buildings everywhere! This quaint little spot is in the bottom of one of the gazillion new buildings in the Fremont area. So inside it&apos;s pretty standard style for the time, clean straight lines, hard seating and kinda dark with natural elements highlighting some clean design. Standard.  Their Happy Hour was good... but It was a meh experience. 

The Food:  We got a few snacks to go with our Bevvys... those were the Tuna Ceviche and the BBQ Pork Sliders.  The Ceviche was great, but the house made chips were soggy and chewy which made this dish hard to eat. Enough that we didn&apos;t finish even though the tuna was tasty.  The sliders were delicious. Nothing mind blowing but very good. 

Drinks: Great Happy Hour Prices on their drinks,.. ours were $6. I had a house Gimlet (Nice, crisp and perfect)  and my husband tried their old fashioned. Love the large clear ice cube with the correct cherries in the Old Fashioned (the cherries should be dark burgundy not candy apple red. Those should ONLY be used in Shirley temples... Off my soapbox I go) 

Service:  She was nice, kinda. She had a bit of an attitude and I almost felt like I should apologize for inconveniencing her during her set up time at the bar or something. She got us all our drinks and checked in but she seemed more sour than my gimlet. 

Ambiance:  I already talked about this a bit but it&apos;s kinda hard seating. so I wasn&apos;t a big fan. 

Will I be back. Probably not. Was it good... some of it, yes.","So my friends and I came here for dinner because we wanted to be able to walk to Fremont Brewery afterwards and it was empty. 

Husband and I ordered a cup of clam chowder, the tuna ceviche, and shrimp tacos to split. Everything was tasty but our portions were small so we left still kind of hungry.

The clam chowder was on point. Nice portion for a cup, not too thick, good flavor, and chunks of clam.

The tuna ceviche was nice and fresh with crispy chips. But be mindful that this is really small. It should be considered more of an appetizer than a plate.

The shrimp tacos were also good. I didn&apos;t want to order them at first because I&apos;m usually not of fan of corn tortillas (I prefer flour) but they turned out really delicious with a kick of spice! Once again, the 3 tacos were really small so don&apos;t order this if you&apos;re hungry.","I&apos;ve been to a lot of Seattle happy hours, and I can say with confidence that you&apos;re gonna pay AT LEAST $2 more to get a better cocktail anywhere else. The Sidecar is great, solid &amp; strong martinis, and the food is also a great deal. Get the goat cheese!","This place is definitely not my favorite on a warm day. The beautiful glass enclosure in the front gave the place a greenhouse effect with no AC. It wasn&apos;t a comfortable meal. The service was so-so. There was only 3 other tables there and the waitress couldn&apos;t even muster the strength to smile when she greeted us. The menu offered a variety of dishes but few options. The food was bland. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this place for dinner. Maybe for happy hour or drinks. Their French 77 was delicious! It had elderflower liqueur, muddled lemons, raw sugar, lemon twist, and prosecco.","I can&apos;t speak for the food, however the drinks are fantastic! My friend and I came here this evening for drinks and boy does Scott sure know what he&apos;s doing! I couldn&apos;t decide on a good bourbon drink between the lions tail and the ni so of course I decided to try both! I absolutely loved both of them and honestly couldn&apos;t decide which I liked better. I tend to be an old fashioned type of girl and generally like my whiskey pretty straight forward. However the allspice in the lions tail was beyond perfect and the grapefruit shrub in the Ni was an unexpected perfect match. Overall Scott&apos;s mixology was pure perfection! It was a quiet night there but other patrons seemed to be enamored with their food as well. I definitely plan to return for drinks with friends and perhaps try a bite to eat as well!","5 star because it is a neighborhood gastropub that is so nice to have in the area. Great food, prices and service. I have visited several times 4-6 pm and also once late. Undiscovered gem.","I came here after work with a bunch of colleagues/friends, after our usual place was filled to the brim (the Pacific Inn, check them out!). While this place was a 2nd choice, and it was my first time frequenting the establishment, I was happily surprised with how great it was! First off, the atmosphere has a dark, modern feel to it, with lightly colored wooden tables and dark furniture accents. Can modern and cozy be a thing? Well, it is for 36 Stone! Their prices were also astonishingly decent! Because the space feels so new and clean, I expected prices to be on the higher end, but during happy hour their cocktails were only $6! Normal food (example, Cuban sandwich or an 8 oz. steak) ranged from $10-$14 and it came with pretty big portions. They do offer smaller plates as well, like fries, almonds, or olives ($5 each), which were also decently sized!

The service was also great! Our server was funny, attentive, and even though we got louder as the night went on, she was still super nice! We ended up ordering three rounds of drinks, with food smattered here and there. Thank you kind lady for dealing with rowdy women!!!

Needless to say, I&apos;m a fan of this place and will be coming back!","Great environment and friendly staff. Went here to meet my gf&apos;s friends because I needed somewhere that had good food and wasn&apos;t too crazy as far as cuisine and price. Decent price for the food. I had the Cuban sandwich. Not bad be the bread was kinda hard, don&apos;t eat the pasta salad. Over cooked pasta that had a weird flavor. The menu was all over the place either the options which made ordering feel dicey. Hand cut fries were okay, and dumplings were okay, although I&apos;d rather have them fried to soak up the sauce they were in or reduce the sauce to make it stick to the dumplings. Their aioli needs work, maybe a garlic lime with cilantro or chipotle honey. Also blanching fries does wonders","So good.  That&apos;s all you really need to know.  But I&apos;ll elaborate and say that every food item, every drink, beer selection, wine selection... they all lead to high levels of satisfaction.  36 Stone is often a bit empty appearing and I&apos;m totally confused by this and you should just go in, sit down, and order something.  I&apos;m positive you&apos;ll be happy with whatever you choose.  I&apos;ve been here many times and never disappointed.  I think they rank among the best in Seattle bar food/drink but they&apos;re small, quiet, maybe a little shy on the business front and just going about the day to day.  Summary:  Super solid chill place to eat and have fantastic drinks.  Highly recommended.","One of the new little bars that seems to be popping up with all the new mixed use construction. Wait staff is friendly. The food menu is rather small, but my colleagues enjoyed the chowder. I&apos;m not sure this place knows what it wants to be yet, but still it is perfectly pleasant to grab a drink or three here with friends.","awesome place! it is the perfect little corner cafe down the street. food is good and service is decent. drinks are lovely. 

great prices on food, which i definitely appreciate!","I can&apos;t say enough wonderful things about 36 Stone! This is a great little hangout spot, I frequent here about 3 times a week because the food, drinks, and service is spot on--and I live above it. Amazing Greek salad, and the best moscow mules I&apos;ve had. The hummus plate is my favorite appetizer, along with the feta fries. The Caprese sandwich was also a hit--you really can&apos;t go wrong with any of the items on the menu. Now if only they would open up for brunch...they&apos;ve already got fresh squeezed mimosas!","Very pleasantly surprised! We came here for a quick meal looking for a place with AC. We ordered the Thai chicken sandwich and the steak and mashed yukons. The food is simple but extremely well executed, the seats are comfy, it&apos;s rarely too crowded, and service is quick. 

We&apos;ll be back!","What&apos;s not to love about this neighborhood brewery!? The staff are always great, food is good, beer is great + they have a full bar if beer isn&apos;t your jam (but it should be ;)) 
During COVID procedures they have done a wonderful job of social distancing tables, consistent cleaning, sanitizer on hand, masks, and all that fun stuff. Their beer is always consistent, always good. Love their IPAs! Their food is great as well. Menu shrunk a bit for COVID but no worries - they have all your pizza/burger/wing needs! 
My favorites:
Spicy Hawaiian pizza
Wings
Fries - seriously...order some...with all their delicious dipping sauces

You really can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu. Highly recommend stopping by even if it&apos;s for a to go order. Support local!","This place is absolutely amazing. The owner, Rick, is the absolute nicest guy!!! He made sure that my drink was good and the service made sure that we were comfortable with everything. This meant SO much to me especially during Covid. I would DEFINITELY recommend this place, such a great brewery. This was my first time here and it left a lasting impression. I will for sure be back!!","Staff all wore masks and gloves including the cooks (except for the host in the beginning). The bartender was great about safety. She used hand sanitizer on her gloves after every customer. The spacing was very roomy and made me feel comfortable. In general, I felt safe--and I&apos;m very concerned about safety right now.

The pizza wasn&apos;t great. I think the cheese might have been off; reminded me of Alphy&apos;s.","I&apos;ve been here twice now and I felt safe and at home both times. 
The staff and clientele have been enjoyable, friendly, courteous (safe), and aware of our current situation but at the same time eager to provide an experience that we are all missing this year. Thank you! 
I just had their pizza and it was as good as they were known for as well as the vast selection of beers they offered. 
Good service, good atmosphere, good food, good drinks. I can&apos;t complain! Good times.","Food is undersold here! I love the burger and fries, as good as Uneeda Burger and the fries are amazing.
Of course the beer is stelar!",Great beers and customer service. Great vibe to the place and service goes above and beyond to take care of you.,"I came here for the Sunday afternoon meet up gaming group. They have a whole back room reserved for Sunday gaming which I love!! Thank you for doing that! 

Atmosphere: a little dead on the weekend (that&apos;s probably why they are able to reserve a whole back room for us gamers) but it&apos;s probably hopping during the week. The college kids are all probably out of town on the weekends.

Food: I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food here. I&apos;ve had their burgers, chips, and fries.... Oh. My. God. The FRIES. I haven&apos;t had such great fries since high school (aka. a long time ago)! I use to dream about those fries!! They are Super crispy and flavorful and has such great texture. I got the burger just to get the fries because I didn&apos;t want to look like a pig just eating a giant plate of fries.....so worth it!!! The burger comes with many fries too! 

All in all, come play games with us on Sunday and get their fries!","Absolute best place to grab a brew on the Ave. The owner Rick is personable and cares about his customers, whether it&apos;s your first or hundredth time here. I&apos;ll come here for years to come.",This is my favorite bars around the University of Washington. It&apos;s the best food and amazing beers. The owner is super nice and loves to get to know everyone that comes it. I recommend it to anyone that wants to try awesome new beers they have never tried before.,"This is one of my lifetime favorite places, and they have my all time favorite beer: breakfast cereal killer stout. on tap now! Bartenders are awesome. Food is great, too.","Used to love coming here and watching football/basketball games but over the years it&apos;s gotten worse. They always have my favorite cider, and the happy hour food use to be great. This time I went it&apos;s been the worst of all tims. We picked a table where we could see the TV clearly and asked the waitress to clean it off. She acknowledge she&apos;d be right over, about 7 minutes later we just started to clean it ourselves which is when she finally came over. 

Ordered the basic nachos and garlic cheese pizza bread. The chips were burnt &amp; stale and the cheese was not completely melted. The pizza bread was overly crunchy and chewy flatbread. I was very disappointed. We&apos;ll see about returning.","I&apos;m definitely a local at this place. Living in the area makes it an easy walk and cheap beer, happy hour all day Sunday so what&apos;s not to love? Your typical diner style food options: fries, burgers, sandwiches.  I can&apos;t speak much to the food but beer is great!",C&apos;mon. Great beers and variety for everyone. Friendly staff. And part of what keeps the University District unique. This place deserves your support.,"Good beer and good pizza. A near perfect combination. We had to order/pay at the bar, but pizza was delivered to our table. We got the veggie pizza with extra mushrooms. Delicious.","I recently made a visit into Big Time Brewing while visiting the U District for the first time since moving to Seattle.  Of course, a quick yelp search for beer in the area lead me here and as usual my fellow yelpers recommending this place did not disappoint.  

Late afternoon on a Sunday the place wasn&apos;t too crowded, seemed to have a couple of regulars at the bar and some other patrons playing board games while enjoying some beers.  I can imagine during the school year this place might be a bit busier with students, but I was glad to have the cool relaxed vibe while we were in there.  

Big Time only has beer and wine (and Underberg, of course!) but the selection is great.  I think the guy behind the bar was the brewer, or maybe an owner? He was so friendly and really knew a lot about the different styles.  We grabbed a couple beers and some dinner.  The food has huge portions and so affordable!  A good selection of pizzas, burgers and snacks to share.  If you&apos;re really enjoying the beers and want some more - they do growler fills and some bottles to go!  I&apos;ll be back here for sure. cheers!","Touring the UW with my niece I saw this place as we are walking on University Avenue, and asked her about it and she said it has been there for 30 years!!

So I had to go there before we left SEATTLE!

The next day I dragged the whole fam damily down there + relatives. Went to the bar and ordered a plethora of bar food, garlic bread, wings, calzone, cheese fries, etc.

Had an IPA and a tame beer for my niece, then switched to the nw x ne hazy, excellent. Everything about this place is old school vintage except the beers, right on point with all the modern craft beers, except they were doing craft long, long before anyone else. Wish Reno had this.","Came for happy hour and had a couple beers and ciders, and food from the happy hour menu. Everything was great and the atmosphere was fun.","If you&apos;re in the U District area, this is a great place to come and hang out with friends. They have great happy hour which has not just drinks, but you get food too. The garlic pizza bread is great and if you want something light, the chips and salsa never disappoint for under $4 on the happy hour menu. It&apos;s a fun atmosphere if you wanna watch a game or something. It&apos;s just a chill place to grab some food at the end of the day and just hang out.

It&apos;s very close to UW So if you need a good place to hang out, come check it out!","The rudest service I&apos;ve ever encountered. You couldn&apos;t pay me to come here again, so bad it made me leave my first review. Wish I could give it a zero!","I came by this place while I was visiting my friend. I&apos;m not usually into bars but the food here was quite good. I was still able to chat with friends over the typical bar noise. It&apos;s a nice atmosphere. Seconding the reviewer on the fries, they&apos;re fantastic and not as overpriced as bar food normally is! If you&apos;re in the area, this is a great place to grab a beer or a cider with friends.","Was surprised to find a vegan restaurant front and center at University Village. I had heard some great things about Veggie Grill food and I was anxious to give it a try.

I have been to a wide variety of vegan restaurants, food trucks, and shops of all sorts. I&apos;d place Veggie grill right in the middle in regards to nutrition and healthfulness. Plant-based whole foods are the vegan nutrition goal in a perfect world. But knowing that goal, the food at veggie grill mimics real dishes and vegan meats are used freely as well as fries and desserts. But there are some other items that are very nutritious to balance things out. Plus the food here is delicious and bound to encourage many to eat a more healthful diet.

Food: I had to try the pastrami sandwich. Fried rye bread, sauce, sauerkraut all grilled to perfection. This was a must-try for me and it did not disappoint. It came with a side and I chose lentil soup which was good and healthful to boot. My carrot cake with imitation cream cheese frosting was also very good.

My companion had a grilled chicken sandwich with fries and she loved it.

Service: Friendly and helpful with a Spanish language twist. 

COVID 19: Take out and delivery plus dine in. We dined in with social distancing and it was appropriate and safe.

Four Stars from me and I will come back and work my way through the menu.","For the Yelp Big Night In during April, our family ended up ordering from 5 different places.

One of my daughters ordered from one of her fave places - Veggie Grill. This order came from their U Village location. 

She ordered the Buffalo Bomber sandwich with fake chicken that was breaded and had buffalo sauce and she added avocado to it. The sandwich came with fries. She also ordered the crispy cauliflower which was breaded and came with Buffalo sauce on the side. She told me she liked both items and will definitely go back to this restaurant. 

I&apos;ve eaten here with her in the past and the place was very busy and the vegetarian food was pretty tasty. 

Eating healthy during the pandemic was never so easy! Give this place a try!","I have gone to Veggie Grill for many years and in many cities! It is the best vegan fast food chain (compared to others like Native Foods in Chicago) and has consistently tasty food. There are healthier options (like salads and bowls) and less healthy ones too (burgers, dessert, etc). I really appreciate that the nutrition information is included online. One of my favorite appetizers is the buffalo cauliflower with orange glaze. SO good. I usually get a sandwich, but this time around I opted to try the Bulgogi Beef Bowl - it had a lot of protein and in the middle of a bike ride, that seemed good. The vegan beef was surprisingly good (I have never had real beef) and it took about 20 minutes for the takeout to be ready. I would say, though, that it is a little pricey and the portion size wasn&apos;t huge. At least in this takeout version.","This place is confusing if you&apos;re not a vegetarian/vegan. As a voracious meat eater who came with a vegetarian friend, I was very confused by the terminology like &quot;chick&apos;n&quot; (which is not actually chicken) and mac n cheese (which is made from nut cheese). 

Nut cheese is a completely atrocity on this planet. I felt sick to my stomach after eating the mac n cheese, but that&apos;s also because I&apos;m accustomed to the regular delicious mac n cheese with real dairy cheese.","Great quality food, it is flavorful with quite a few options, good service and online ordering works very well, cute environment and good portions sizes. It is it is a little pricey, but I think worth the cost.","I tried the SLU Location before and thought it was good so decided to come to this location to try as we were in the area.

I got the all Hale kale salad and you can tell that the ingredients was fresh and high quality. It comes with a citrus dressing but you definitely dont need it. The kale is already marinated in something and it&apos;s pretty good. It was a healthy lunch and satisfying. The ordering process was also pretty fast and easy.
Definitely a good place for a quick healthy meal","A lady who works here greeted me with the most welcome &quot;hola!&quot; She was so nice and the food I got was fantastic. I love the lentil soup and all their salad bowls. Definitely go here if you want healthy, hearty food that makes you feel good.","Got the veggie burger and mushroom pot pie. Everything tasted pretty good, but the portions seemed to be lacking. Still felt hungry afterward, which is a bummer since this place is a tad more pricey for a University Village restaurant. I can say that the employees were very welcoming and informative on which menu items were popular and well-liked.","This place has a great Quinoa Burger. They also have a great beyond meat taco plate that comes with cilantro and black beans. They also have a matcha tea horchata. Very creamy and delicious. 

It is a little pricey but to have healthy vegan food that is delicious it may come with a cost.","Good alternative to meat. Salad bowls are delicious. However the portion size is too less for the price. Customer service was lacking. We asked for the chairs to be wiped down but that request was basically ignored.

The burgers are pretty bland even though we ordered expected the buffalo chicken burger to be spicy.
We will be back for the salad bowls but perhaps might try a different location","Normally, I would give Veggie Grill a 3/5. It&apos;s very expensive which does not make it accessible to lower income families. Even if Veggie Grill is &quot;healthier&quot; than other fast food chain counterparts, it comes down to price for many families. However, most recently during the COVID-19, they offered a Family Meal Deal for just $39.95! This is a big deal, as normal it would cost way over $100 for what they are offering in this Family Meal Deal. I greatly appreciate their efforts in trying to make their foods more affordable than before during this pandemic.",Megh I feel the food has gone downhill. I haven&apos;t had Veggie grill in a year but had a craving today. I ordered the &quot;chicken&quot; patty protein style. It used to have more flavor and there was just a tiny teaspoon of avocado on it. Also the Mac and cheese sauce is still yummy like I remember but ew the lemon zest on it is pretty gross. Wasn&apos;t an option for the side dish to remove it. I will still try more options I just wish the quality was as good as I remember it to be.,"I actually really love the food here, but the service sucks.  It&apos;s great to have a ton of options for those of us who are vegan/vegetarian, and the menu is great.  However, their service is at best mediocre and at worst rude.  One glaring example is when I ordered a meal and specifically asked for a side of the mashed potatoes.  I was given a side of fries instead, which I am unable to eat because fried foods cause heartburn.  When I asked one of the staff members about it, she just shrugged and said &quot;sorry&quot;, not offering to rectify the mistake even after I told her I wouldn&apos;t be able to eat it.  She told me I should have &quot;been more clear&quot; and walked away, even though my receipt said mashed potatoes.","I go here pretty often with my friends and family and it&apos;s always a good idea and the place is clean. Even though it&apos;a vegan, the options are very wide and it tastes like meat. The price is really good for what you get and the staff is super friendly too. If you&apos;re vegan, veggie grill is a phenomenal place to go to. You won&apos;t be disappointed.",Shitty customer service here!  Taking this hole off my restaurant list (at least this step location) and uninformed manager and staff,"This is long overdue, but I&apos;m amending my review. The manager reached out to me and acknowledged the issues I had. Since then, I&apos;ve been back numerous times. I love the food, especially the salads, but I&apos;ve also enjoyed trying their seasonal offerings. Everything I&apos;ve had has been delicious. This is my go to place whenever I&apos;m in the University Village area.","It&apos;s a weird day when you catch me at a vegetarian/vegan place, but I&apos;ll do my best to be fair at least, given that I&apos;m a huge carnivore. Upon arrival around 4pm Sunday the food wait was 30 mins coming out from the kitchen. The Tempura Green beans were the best, addicting and crispy with a good garlic ranch sauce (so good I dipped my regular fries into it). The Sante Fe &quot;Chicken&quot; sandwich was good, but I imagined it to be a healthier (more bland) McChicken with avocado and whole wheat bun. Looking back at my photo, they actually forgot the spicy mayo on it, but I was probably too hungry to care. The Mediterranean salad was not my cup of tea. The falafels (only 3 included) are actually well seasoned with spices, but the salad and soggy flat bread leave more to be desired.

Take my ideally meat-eating 2 cents for what it&apos;s worth. Will I come back to try their &quot;burgers&quot;....for the expected taste and price probably not, but it&apos;s a healthy option out there. There&apos;s plenty of inside seating (some outside too) and parking is manageable enough on weekends.","I used to come here often before we moved. We were in the area and decided to drop in. The staff are great but the food was awful, awful, awful. 
Tried that new thanksgiving dinner sandwich. It arrived looking awful, like glop on a plate. Cranberries overpowered it, stuffing was tasteless and the texture was mush or slime or what you get when you mix those two things together. &apos;Turkey&apos; was your average processed gluten stuff.  SKIP THIS. ITS DISGUSTING 
my husband ordered what he usually ordered, the buffalo &apos;chikin&apos; and it tasted like sat in SOAP.  Inedible meal. Wasted money on this awful, awful food. Never going back.","I went for lunch on a Wednesday and the place wasn&apos;t too crowded, which is why I don&apos;t understand what took them so long to make my order. I ordered the Mediterranean salad plate to-go and I sat waiting for over 15 mins and then when I went back up to check on the order it was ready but they hadn&apos;t called my name! 
Then to add insult to injury, when I got home I realized they forgot to put my dressing in the bag! 
The salad was still good without the dressing but customer service needs some major improvement.","I wasn&apos;t a fan of veggie grill. The only thing that was appetizing was their fake buffalo wings which did resemble real chicken but they were DOUSED in buffalo sauce. Seriously!!!! Way tooooo much sauce on it. My husband and I got a salad and a burger in addition to the wings and everything came out to nearly $40... for a very small portion of food that really didn&apos;t taste appetizing at all. Not to mention that the tables were surprisingly dirty and not cleaned off. For someone vegetarian, I&apos;d recommend seeking out some other restaurants or alternatives. This place would be a pass for me. Service was nice though!","Love, love, love this local, community based restaurant. The food is so good, especially the chiles rellenos. Even the rice and refried beans are miles ahead in taste compared to most Mexican restaurants. Please support this restaurant during the pandemic. They do take-away and have inside seating.",The food was really tasty and the portion is HUGE! The owner was very sweet -- he gave us free chips and salsa. Totally understand it&apos;s a very difficult time for local restaurants and we are trying our best to support our neighbor restaurants! Gracias por la comida y servicios will come back to dine-in again!,"I ordered mole pollo and my friend got a super nachos. We don&apos;t really like what we had. The super nachos is a bit flaky. I personally prefer sweet mole and the one I ordered is not close to what I expected. 

Despite all that, the restaurant owner was amazingly friendly and kept asking if we want margaritas or tequila. The outdoor seating at the restaurant would be a good choice for an amazing date.","We love this place! One of the best mexican restaurants in Seattle. The food is delicious, portions are good, the owner is SO nice and SO friendly, the drinks are fabulous! One of our favorites :)","Excellent flavor, authentic feel, and charming service. Patio is great and the ceviche was delicious!",Great small owned restaurant...it is a great place to have a nice enjoyable lunch...prices are fair and food is good...my lunch was 22.00 for a large plate of Nachos and 2 Shredded Beef Tacos Solis a Pacifico Beer.,"The meal felt like home cooked. I really enjoyed the mole verde pork, the lentil soup, and the mango margarita. Please support this place! It deserves way more than the 3.5 stars it gets on Yelp. There was no wait and the patio was nice","Authentic family owned restaurant with amazing, friendly staff. They have the best mole around. When ordering you can&apos;t go wrong with enchiladas but one of my favorites here would have to be the ceviche. Always incredibly refreshing! Thank you chilli pepper we love you guys !!!!","Average. Camarines a la Diablo was brown &amp; not at all spicy like it was cooked in the beans and not in a spicy garlic tomato sauce, and tasted quite different than I&apos;m accustomed to from every other restaurant I&apos;ve been to. I&apos;ll take the rest home and season it properly. Service was friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing and calm which I enjoyed (a break like his midday in the city is nice and rare) hence the three stars. Not much for vegetarians and pescatarians so probably just not the place for me personally.",The Chile Pepper is back open!  We are so happy that they are back.  Delicious chili rellenos .,"hard to find a Mexican restaurant in the area that tops this place! I&apos;ve always tried different dishes and have never been disappointed. the guy who always is my server is very nice and pleasant, he always brings us over little samples and makes great recommendations. check it out, highly recommend.",This place was great!! It reminded me of home! Yummy authentic Mexican with good flavor. The man who helped us did everything: cooked and waited on us! Definitely coming back again.,Excellent food and most of all excellent service!!! The owner is an absolute saint. He even helped us get the bees away from our table when we were sitting outside!!! Couldn&apos;t recommend it enough,"I need to update to five stars based on how hard they work and how pleasant he is. I go here for lunch a couple times a month, and they were out of tamales once. I came back a few weeks later and he gave me a free one.  I&apos;m trying to get more friends to come with me!","I went here for dinner the other night (Tuesday 6pm) and the restaurant only had one other table filled, this made me a bit skeptical. The man working was very friendly and told us to take a seat right away. Ordered chips, salsa and guacamole. The guacamole was delicious, fresh and perfectly seasoned. The margarita was fair, you could tell it was a mix (the only reason for the 4 stars). The ambiance is cute little place. The service of the wait staff was great. It felt family owned and you could tell they were genuinely happy to have to there.
The enchiladas and food were delicious. I will be back!","We had a wonderful dinner at Chile Pepper tonight.  The mole poblano is out of this world.  The verde sauce is spicy, just the way I like it.  My partner had a house margarita and I had the top shelf.  They were the best margaritas we&apos;ve had in a long time.  Both were perfectly balanced.  We enjoyed the slow pace here and the friendly staff.","This place is legit!!! The owner does everything from taking orders to making the food, and even making the margaritas. So friendly, we told him we are from CA  and have been missing good Mexican food, and he brought us flan and lots of other treats to try on the house.

Margs are good, food super deelish and owner is the sweetest! All y&apos;all are haters!","Gotten take out twice from here in the past week and it was excellent both times.  Particularly their authentic Mexican dishes are great, but the burrito is delicious as well.  Favorite Mexican food I have had in Seattle thus far.","Bland, bitter food. Got the chicken mole enchiladas and it had NO flavor!! Idk why I&apos;m still here.. I&apos;m Hispanic and i can&apos;t believe they have given this place 5 stars.",The food is great. The Chile Guajillo and the Chile Relleno dinners are worth driving across the city to eat. Home cooked. Really good. The proprietor is gracious and great to speak with. Excellent restaurant.,"After reading the first reviewer&apos;s input, it seems that Siganos has changed for the better. I also order the 3 tacos, each with a different meat - chicken, pork carnitas &amp; barbacoa (their special for the day).  It was served with an adequate amount of onions and cilantro for added flavor, without being overpowering. There was also a small pile of pickled radish on the side, but I found the tacos to be good without it. 

[Chicken] - a bit on the dryer side and could have used more spice...it was kind of bland. 
[Pork] -  tender, and had a fair amount of seasoning to it
[Barbacoa (shredded beef)] - the BEST out of all the meats. This one had the perfect balance between sweet and savory flavors.  The taste of chipotle peppers really came through in the sauce - a bit smoky, not spicy.  They should make this one of their regular meat options.

The only disappointments were that the food could have been served hotter (temp-wise) and the chicken and pork were lacking some spices. 

I&apos;m glad I gave it a try and I&apos;d go back.  The price for this was $5.25 which really isn&apos;t too bad considering other campus food options....a pre-made Bay Laurel wrap or salad from campus costs about $5-7, so I&apos;d say the taco platter is a better value.","Really, really poor tacos. Meat was dry and not seasoned. &apos;Pickled&apos; radish not even the slightest bit pickled or acidic. Worst part was the stale, yes, hard, crunchy, chewy, stale soft taco shells. Darn near inedible, and I&apos;m not a picky guy in the slightest when it comes to at least finishing my food. Decent portion for $5, but the ingredients were clearly not taken care of well. 

Why 2 stars? Because of the DELICIOUS spicy tater tots with chipotle ranch! Oh my goodness, I did not expect to find something that tasty. $2.50 for a good-sized bowl of crunchy tots powdered with a spicy, intriguing seasoning and smothered with a complex-tasting ranch that balanced off the sharp seasoning with a light creaminess. Really exceptional stuff, and the only reason I&apos;ll ever be back to this truck!

So, NO on the tacos, YES on the amazing spicy tots with chipotle ranch!",Long wait times and mediocre food. Not enough people working here. I ordered around 12:50 and almost was late to my 1:30 class waiting for 3 tacos. Not worth unless you absolutely have no choice,"Ordered the vegan tacos. I got three traditional small tacos, on doubled tortillas about 4&quot; in diameter. The tortillas were dried out flour, not corn. The filling was El Gardein vegan &quot;chickin&quot; with a tiny smattering of chopped onion and some cilantro. There were about six pieces of pickled carrots on the side. There were two jars of salsa, one green, one red, both pretty bland. And that was it. Plain, bland, dried out, and definitely not worth over $5.","This is a damn good Happy Hour spot. We arrived in the pouring rain to sit under their heated, covered patio &amp; the elements didn&apos;t bother us at all. I don&apos;t remember what our bill ended up being, but I remember leaving being happy with the value. I got the tres tacos plate &amp; my girlfriend got the burrito. Everything was flavorful, football games on the TV&apos;s, &amp; the beers came in a frosted glass. We&apos;ll definitely be coming back.","The team at Laredo&apos;s deserves an A+ for their preparedness to reopen during phase 2 of the COVID19 lockdown. Rather than using single-use menus and wasting paper, they had QR codes taped to each table that you scan to get drink and food menus.

Food and drinks are great, as always, and the service was fast and friendly. I wish them success as Seattle reopens.",I live near Laredo&apos;s and grab dinner every couple of weeks - it&apos;s one of my absolute favorite restaurants!! My usual pick is the shrimp taco plate which is always delicious and fresh. They&apos;ve been open for takeout the last couple weeks and I&apos;ve really been loving the cocktails to-go.,"Had happy hour tacos, guac classic &amp; avocado margarita. 
Tacos were so delicious but if you take HH they are very small. My fav was fish taco and beef ( it melted on tongue) chicken taco was ok. 
Avocado margaritas was yummy too.
Guac not recommend $7.99 and tasted very bland. Only good was chips and sauces. 
Service slow but I want to come back for delicious tacos. 
We paid for 2 margaritas, guac and 6 HH tacos $50 with tip. Good deal","Really cool place! Not only were the food and drinks incredible, the music and decor were super exciting. Super cozy environment with lots of fun, traditionally Mexican decorations and music. Drinks were very creative and everyone one that I tried was amazing. A little sweet for my personal taste, but I don&apos;t believe it would bother anyone else. Would recommend if you&apos;re nearby!","I just can&apos;t stand it! I loved it here with atmosphere and people made it welcome two times in two weeks! I know I went back and was blown away! 

After my work peeps came here I just wanted to share it with my family! It was sunny two night, no wait both times! The food was great! They have specials and the drinks are just sooo tasty! I know the ppl i was with the first time are thinking why a favor star! Our waitress was fluttered, but I will mention she forgot multiple things in less than an hour! (Water, drinks, black beans on my plate, food allergies, napkins, and more). But everything made up for it! 

We were heading to citizen, and don&apos;t serve food past 3pm in Sunday&apos;s and I am NOT getting fast food like they recommended, I got Laredos! It was perfect before the long night of dancing and drinking. If your looking for a dope set up, sun (sit on the outside balcony) and want some tasty food and drinks, here it is! Our theme for the weekend was Mexican; just always everyone&apos;s favorite!","Solid 3 star texmex place with a pretty good hh... as an ex-Texan (Dallas/Austin) I have certain expectations when it comes to texmex and while some things were great, others not so much:

Great:
- carne asada skewers- well seasoned, nice medium cook on tender cuts of beef.  Served with a smoky dipping sauce.  #ftw
- chips &amp; salsa - I&apos;m assuming it came with the queso (more about that later)... chips were light and crisp, 2 different salsas
- nice selection of margaritas

Ok:
- crispy beef taco- generous portion, well seasoned meat, shell was thin so fell apart easily 
- churros- a little over fried but decent portion and not overly sweet
- Mexican martini- Too much olive juice 

Not so great:
- queso- was more like a grainy dip, slightly tart, not the creamy cheesiness I was expecting 
-flan- one bite and was sent back... covered in whipped cream, super dense 

Overall good spot for HH (or to watch UT games) with friendly service...","The ambiance is excellent. They have a table with a lit up fire pit in the center, which is an excellent idea! The food however, left more to be desired. The nachos were pretty good, but the chips weren&apos;t the best tasting. The meat also could&apos;ve used more salt. The tacos, also pretty good, but the tortilla is white corn and they tasted like microwaved mission tortillas. We also needed to add salsa and salt. Also, the other reviews about it smelling like bonfire in there, the second we walked in - we understood. Margaritas are pretty good! My friend had a frozen margarita, which he said didn&apos;t taste the best - but I didn&apos;t try it, so I can&apos;t really say. I wouldn&apos;t necessarily come back here. Maybe for a drink. However, if you happen to pop by I recommend house margaritas and tacos. Simple is better!","Wanted to try something fun around the space needle for new years. Reservations were made and was seated quickly. The service was extremely friendly. Never been here but didnt expect much out of the american styled tex/mex food. I was wrong. My meal was juicy and savory. The Fancy drink was delicious and even ordered seconds! As for the margaritas, it lacked alcohol theand other fountain drinks - they were too watered out due to the excessive amount of ice, besides that, i enjoyed it all.","Solid 3.5 stars. This place gains points for convenience and proximity, and it&apos;s hard to go wrong with chips and dip! I haven&apos;t tried a meal yet but would reevaluate after. 

Ambiance: It&apos;s comfortable. Not fancy or pretentious. The dark wood gives it as but if a rustic feel and the seating is convenient for parties of 2,or 4. 

Drinks and appetizers: I&apos;m not a tequila or beer drinker so my drink options are often more limited. Great happy hour prices though! The chips with the (vegan) guacamole (yes that&apos;s a thing) are always satisfying. 

Service: This is probably what I like the most. It&apos;s chill and all servers I&apos;ve had have been attentive not intrusive. It&apos;s ok to have a drink or two and talk, unlike some places that force you to get a meal. Dore this reason alone, Laredos will stay a classic neighborhood joint!","Delicious! The carne asada fajitas were awesome. We had happy hour margaritas and queso. Margaritas were really good for being happy hour, normally I feel like places make them with less alcohol. These were not they were great. 
Carne asada quesadilla was also great. We will be back, very happy :)","I feel very conflicted. On one hand I was stoked to see a spot in Seattle who dares to have Tex-Mex. Then after going I sadly remembered this is not real Tex-Mex.  Sure they have a Trudy&apos;s Mexican martini on the menu but Trudy&apos;s it is not. First it was missing salt on the rim and olives. It also didn&apos;t have quite the right punch or flavor. Missing metal shaker aside this was a margarita.
The queso tasted better than it looked as it was lumpy and appeared more like hummus.
The salad was fine. The Tortilla soup had too much shredded chicken in it
 I liked the salsa, but the cabbage Pico they had I had never seen ever during the 8 years Iived in Austin. It was OK just not what I expected in a Tex-mex restaurant.
They have a good happy hour, nice atmosphere and good service.","Found this place by accident when I happened to input the wrong place into my GPS. A pleasant surprise. Good food and food service. 

We sat at the bar and ordered Kimchee pork belly tacos and the roasted cauliflower salad with  grilled chicken. Both were pleasing due to a deft combination of contrasting flavors. Especially liked the pickled  onions in the salad!

Portions were larger than expected too so we&apos;ll be back.","I was visiting Seattle from California for my Birthday and we wanted Mexican food with some margaritas. Our hotel the Hampton Inn, suggested Laredo&apos;s, which was walking distance. Our server Luis was awesome. Thank you for your hospitality. The food was great as well as our margaritas. I requested a special song for my birthday but unfortunately the manager would not change his music to accommodate just one song request for my special occasion. That was unfortunate. We decided to go to another restaurant with better ambiance. It&apos;s too bad that a Mexican restaurant does not play mexican music. I definitely will not recommend this restaurant for parties.","I have been coming to Laredos grill since few months. Place is good and prices are reasonable. Place is comfy you can go their for casual meet ups and meals. Although the good is not really as good as you would prefer. The salad here is not good, very bland however the churros are amazing. The food isn&apos;t consistent I would say, some day you will get fresh tacos some day you won&apos;t. The place lacks consistency, other than that its good.","We just had our dinner...  THAT WAS AMAZING!!   I&apos;ve not had anything or anywhere to compare.  As far as we&apos;re concerned, we we&apos;ll continue to order from you.  So Delicious, and the presentation was beautiful.","Amazing lunch spot. Usually easy to get a spot, and the specials are a steal, but don&apos;t lack flavor. My go to is usually the Carne Asasa, but I&apos;ve also had great luck with the fajitas and enchiladas. The staff is friendly, the portions are generous, and there is so much variety.","I&apos;ve been to this place many times over the course of  many years and the last two times, have had an interesting experience. The food is good, servers are usually great, my only complaint is you leave smelling like you&apos;ve just returned from a 3 day camping trip. You&apos;ll have wash your hair and all of your clothes because you will smell like a bonfire. It never used to be this way. I&apos;m not quite sure if they changed the way they cook or if it&apos;s something different with the fire table in the dining area, or if their ventilation stopped working, but it&apos;s the only reason I won&apos;t go back again.","The staff here were excellent. Shannon immediately greeted us and sat us when we entered on a busy New Years Eve.  She sat us at a table with a genuine and welcoming server, Jane. Jane was kind, funny, and kept us laughing while being honest about what she loved about the menu. The food was great when you take it for what it is -- a Tex-Mex place in the PNW.  The crunchy tacos were spot on and the skirt steak was cooked extremely well. Thanks to the great food and even better staff, we chose to try out brunch the next day (where we got their names).  Thanks again to these two and providing excellent service. Cheers.","I have been here twice already and had a great experience for both. I love the fun atmosphere indoors and the summer relaxation on the patio outside. Came here with no reservations each time and was seated immediately (only two in the party). For my hubby&apos;s birthday they gave us a wonderful on-the-house dessert (you actually got to choose which one you wanted). The Husband chose the churros and it came with candles and all :) The churros were a bit on the chewy side but they were free so no complaints here. I was excited to find queso dip here since I went to college in the South and the queso on the east and west coast just aren&apos;t the same. They do put green Chile&apos;s inside of it though and the hubby wasn&apos;t a fan (he&apos;s the one that grew up in the south and used to have Tex Mex three times a week before moving the west coast). The enchiladas were delicious though. The second time I was here, I brought my girlfriend for their generous $5 margaritas (yay they do exist in Seattle!!). You do have to pay for chips and salsa which is my one qualm. This is probably my go-to Tex/Mex place in the city! Glad I found it!","We had the pleasure of celebrating my in-laws&apos; 45th anniversary at Eight Row yesterday evening and I&apos;m so glad we chose this spot for the occasion. The food was amazing (very &apos;farm-to-table&apos; fresh), deep wine selection, and the service was fantastic.

Given all the challenges with going to restaurants amidst COVID, they&apos;ve done a great job using both their indoor and outdoor space to safely accomodate small groups like ours. We look forward to our next visit or a to-go meal whenever possible. Thank you team Eight Row!","My lovely lady and I had our anniversary dinner here. First time we had dined at eight row although we&apos;ve walked by and anxiously waited for the opportunity to try it once reopening to customers during covid.

What a great experience! We were greeted with complimentary sparkling white wine which was delightful and refreshing in the summer sun. We were told happy anniversary, and even later provided with most tasty mixed berry pie ever! All on the house. 

My partner doesn&apos;t like egg plant and I love it, so we ordered the fried eggplant, grilled broccoli, duck, and barbacoa. We went all in. Whoa. We both could not get enough of the eggplant. It was seasoned so well, still firm but not undercooked and a subtle hint of spice.

The grilled broccoli was also done delightfully. Then there was the duck. The skin was crispy, the breast was pink and soft, everything was flavored to perfection.

I&apos;m Mexican and from Hawaii, so the pork was reminiscent of kalua pig but with Hispanic flare. Apricot mole is where it is at! There were so many great flavors. We had exceptional service and Gus made us the tastiest drinks. The Gus special and dirty martinis with haku vodka for the win. Couldn&apos;t have asked for a better night out! We&apos;ve already recommended this place to several friends and will continue to do so. 

If you or your people enjoy stone fruits, they also sell local produce from their family farm. Our kids love the apricots and white nectarines. Excellent quality and just super nice folks. Thanks again.","I had the most lovely dinner at EightRow. This is such a beautiful restaurant. They have converted the inside to a Bodega where you can pick up fantastic bottles of wine and other produce. We sat outside, which had a wonderful ambiance. The service was great! We felt very safe with the measures they were taking--masks are required when you&apos;re not eating and drinking at your table, they provided hand sanitizer, all the staff were diligent about wearing masks. 

We ate a bunch of food, all of it delicious. The tacos to share were amazing, the burrata and tomato salad was perfect, and the corn cake dessert was delicious and totally unique. 

Finally feels like Greenlake has some food worth talking about! I can&apos;t wait to go back!","Dear Locals - Please try Eight Row and keep going back. This place is a gem and I&apos;m coming here every time I return to Seattle. The fried eggplant is the best dish I&apos;ve had all year. (This is coming from a ribeye-loving gal!)

What made this such top-to-bottom, memorable dining experience is that Eight Row knows how to combine fantastic food with a warm and welcoming team of people. It was the first night of the new outdoor dining only restrictions and I&apos;d just arrived in town that afternoon. Janice was so kind and attentive, and the owner even came out to fix the heat lamp since it was chilly outside.

The food:
Fried Eggplant - Every note in this dish just sings! I would eat this every week if I lived in Seattle.
Half Duck - Perfectly cooked. Can you bottle that pear mostarda? 
Apple Pie - This thing was mile high and the apples were so delicious (and not overly dressed in sugar and spices like some apple pies). I&apos;m not shy to admit I ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day.

It&apos;s been a month since I visited and I (obviously) can&apos;t forget it!","I honestly think it is overrated. Their coffee was really bad, and I still don&apos;t know why I had to pay $3 for this cup of coffee :/
Their brunch was okay, but to be honest, I was quite disappointed. The price was way too high for this quality of food. I couldn&apos;t finish my brunch (it&apos;s not because I was full.) and I packed it home. I didn&apos;t even finish my leftover. It was really sad that the food wasn&apos;t that great.","Came for brunch Saturday morning around 10:30am and was seated right away, wasn&apos;t crazy busy or anything. I don&apos;t know if it was just our server or the way their service typically, is but beware if you want a quick brunch... 

My partner ordered the special which was prime rib hash which could have been amazing but was sadly dry and overcooked. The sauce was bright brought everything together though there could have been more of it. I ordered the wild rice and quinoa bowl which was tasty! I liked the pickled golden beets. 

The dish that caught us by surprise though was the horchata pain perdue! It was massive and so delicious. The bread was so soft and the flavors were amazing altogether. It&apos;s definitely a sharing dish unless you have a massive breakfast sweet tooth! 

I&apos;d come back to try out their dinner menu. It&apos;s definitely a cute space but hopefully our super slow service was just a one time thing.","Oh Eight Row.... how I wanted to love you. And maybe someday I will! But for now... its 3 stars. 

Came in for dinner on a Friday night a few weeks back. Kind of late, around 8:30 so it wasn&apos;t too busy. D√©cor is cute. I like that they&apos;ve brightened the place up from the previous Lucia vide. Initial greeting from the hostess was friendly and we were seated promptly (had a reservation). My overall feeling on this place is that it has good potential and a lot of room to grow. The menu reflects a well thought out approach but some of the flavors in the dishes just didn&apos;t quite make sense for me. I love simple, I love complex, I love great food. But if you&apos;re going to attempt to elevate your menu with more complexity, you need to do it right. If the components in the dish don&apos;t jive, its just an over complicated plate which wasn&apos;t well executed. 

We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and dessert. Food reviews as follows:

Seared Calamari - Not your typical, which was exciting. This was calamari stuffed with chorizo. That part was good! I enjoyed the flavor combo. The accompaniments however (carrot puree, mint), didn&apos;t seem to pair well in my opinion. Room for improvement. 

Black Cod Ceviche - Enjoyed this, fish was fresh and it did have an overall &quot;bright&quot; theme to the dish. Some of the pickled items and the overuse of mint didn&apos;t quite make sense with the other items but I understand the direction they were going in. 

Duck Breast - Gahhh. Was so on the fence with this dish. I wanted to love it because the duck was actually cooked perfectly. The skin, my fav was on point but it was way over salted :( and I can handle salt, love salt but even this was a little much for me. The rest of the dish was good overall, nothing which made me scream wow, but nice texture combos with the wild rice and the mostarda and decent depth of flavor. 

Hanger Steak - Best part of this dish was the sunchokes. Steak and chimichurri were underwhelming and under seasoned. Maybe just not the spot for steak. 

Olive Oil Brownie - Im a sucker for dessert! and I love olive oil anything. The server sold us on this, indicating that the olive oil kept the brownie super moist, almost gooey. Uh, not the case. This baby was dry. But luckily the sweet cream ice cream was delightful and gave the brownie some moisture assistance. 

This was a tough review to right because at first glance I think this place should be 5 stars and I can appreciate the creative dishes their going for. Just didn&apos;t feel the value was there at this time. I do think i&apos;ll give this place another try (and hopefully update my review) as they do serve brunch and i&apos;m always down for a great brunch. 

Until next time Eight Row!","My husband and I came this past Saturday and I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s extreme to say that this is our new favorite restaurant in Seattle. The service was pleasant and attentive. We also had great food recommendations. The ambience was casual but sort of LA with plants everywhere, even in the bathrooms.

I ordered the mezcal cocktail, which was literally on fire. The smoky smell was a bit overwhelming but the drink tasted delicious. Appetizers, we ordered oysters, fried egg plant and clams. For the main dish we split the crab chitarra, which a nice server explained was the word for guitar because the spaghetti was like guitar strings. The pasta had a perfect spice to it and I thought about it most days since I&apos;ve had it.

Overall I think the food was all thoughtfully made, service was excellent, and menu was well priced. We will be back very soon.","I live a block away, so when Eight Row popped up I visited the first week. I&apos;ve also been back a couple more times for dinner and once for brunch. It&apos;s a real gem. It&apos;s nice to have something a little more elevated in the Greenlake area! 

Some dishes I highly recommend are the Venison + Pork Sausage, the Honey Glazed Half Smoked Chicken, the local lettuces (such a perfect yet simple salad to pair with anything you order!) and you can&apos;t go wrong with the oysters- very fresh and perfectly chilled. 

The hangar steak and crab salad was just OK to me- I felt like my steak was pretty tough to chew and didn&apos;t seem like it was salted let alone seasoned. Beautiful presentation nevertheless.

Their wine selection is alright. I believe there was only one option by the glass for each type of wine which is fine- but I&apos;d be pleased if they rotate or swap those out because the Cabernet Sauvignon option they offered didn&apos;t wow me. Their Rozella drink is delicious if you&apos;re in the mood for something fruity. It&apos;s just the right amount of sweet/tart/refreshing/satisfying. The Bellini at brunch is great too!

If you&apos;re there for brunch I suggest the Horchata Pain Perdu for something sweet- it&apos;s amazing! Tip: split it with someone. It&apos;s massive and even half of it left me feeling quite indulged. The fried oyster hash is also good and a very unique dish at that! Loved both. Can&apos;t wait to try more brunch items!

I&apos;ve always had pretty great service here. The staff is polite and professional and you can tell they believe in the food and the chef. The space is bright and clean, it could even stand to be a little more dimly lit in the  evenings in my opinion but that&apos;s no reason to complain. Solid 4 stars and I could see a few tweaks earning it a 5th star easily!

Will be back soon to try the squash and pumpkin dishes yum","I think it has a lot of potential. 

The hostess was incredibly kind and got us going with some cocktails while we waited for a table. 

Everyone said the best dish was the eggplant so we got that and some broccoli to start. The eggplant was fine, I think it was overhyped. However, the br√≥coli was killer. It rested on a smearing of tarragon alioli. It was perfect for the charred br√≥coli. 

This was followed by the crab noodles (reaaaaally salty), whole trout (good but missed the mark big time with the skin being soft and not crispy) and ended with the brick chicken which was actually really juicy and flavorful. 

It was good but not cheap, would like to go back for happy hour.","Stoped in with a friend for her birthday. We started with the cornuts and it was okay but nothing spectacular. I ordered a drink on happy hour and it was okay but very strong whiskey taste ( if you love whiskey it was the cherry sour and you would probably love it ) Good deal considering only two drinks on happy hour.

I ordered the pickle appetizer and it took over 30 min to come out, the manager said she would comp due to the time. My friend ordered the pasta and she really liked it. I ordered a salad and it was tasty but again a little underwhelmed but the shaved vegetables were unique and good. The pickles finally came and it was all different veggies pickled and the green beans were a flavor explosion so delicious spicy and pickled. 

We ended with a piece of cherry pie and it was delicious neither too sweet or tangy. The manager brought out ice cream from Lopez Island for my friends birthday and it was yummy.  Overall a 4 star experience it was expensive and the happy hour menu underwhelming the pickles were 10 star with all the different flavors and love pickled vegetables. I will be back excited this is in the hood the hangar steak a nearby table looked delicious.","A cute and enjoyable brunch spot! Service was fast and attentive, and the menu was interesting, in a mostly good way. I can usually tell what a dish will be like based on the menu descriptions, but here, the dishes and flavors were a little surprising - again, a good thing! It&apos;s a nice change of pace from the usual fare, though they have some standard dishes if you want something more traditional. This is the kind of place where it&apos;s fun to ask the staff for their input and ask questions!","We were quite excited to try Eight Row reading about it on Eater. Well well well. It was disappointing. For the 2 of us, we ordered 4 dishes. 
-Fried Eggplants: yummm! I do like this dish and recommend it.
-Rockfish Ceviche: can use more brightness and acid. Good amount of heat from jalape√±os. The fish itself has a bit funny texture like not good cut. 
-Pumpkin Gnocchi: great flavors. I really enjoy the mushrooms, roasted and pickled! Gnocchis were really super soft. At first I thought it was raw! I recommend this dish as well. 
-Spaghetti Alla Chitarra: Dungeness crab spaghetti. This dish is the most disappointing of all the 4 we ordered. Pasta cooked nice and al dente. Can&apos;t barely see any crab meats. They were very small and mushy crab that looked and tasted like canned crab! Not worth $25. We didn&apos;t order any alcohol. Our total before tips was $90. 
Atmosphere of restaurant is very comfortable, modern and lovely. 
Service was good. Staffs : nice and helpful. 
Great big space for big group. 
Lots of street parking. 
Overall, we are not in a hurry to come back to this restaurant. We can get better food with $90.","Everything is made with love. The ingredients are local, the preparation is outstanding. We planned our return trip - also their drinks are made in house, juices and such. 

Unique food selection (duck, bison) which my boyfriend loved. The vegetables were too good. Fine dining!!",Not bad!  I enjoy the location and want to support their business during Covid.  Too bad the quarantine is making it hard to dine-in but their to-go orders are pretty decent.,"I&apos;m so sad to be giving Eight Row 3s because I came in with such high hopes. The venue is delightful and gives off really good vibe. Staff were pleasant and their service was timely. However, we did wait around half an hour+ to get our brunch on a not so busy day. I ordered the steak with fried eggs and I couldn&apos;t have been more disappointed in the $25 dish. I kid you not, I got 4 small strips of a measly steak (in their defense, it was cooked to perfection) that must have been under 2oz. For $25? I don&apos;t think so. The pain perdu was overly sweet and their fried oysters dish had 2-3 oysters. The menu looked really creative but the portions were all out of wack. I didn&apos;t try the hash browns but my friends did and they really liked it.","My husband and I thought we would try this place for brunch. First thoughts? The menu was a little precious, but we figured we give it a try. We should have know what we were in for when we took our first sip of coffee. So. Fricking. Bad. This is Seattle, man! We have really great coffee here! This was... memorably bad. 

We discussed just paying for the coffee and leaving, but how bad could it get? Oh, honey...

I went ahead and ordered the Steak and Fried Egg and my husband ordered eggs, bacon and hash browns. Simple. Nothing too difficult. Or so we thought. 

The bacon was burned and the hash browns were severely under cooked. And what&apos;s up with the pickles on top? I know the menu says pickled red onion, but pickled cucumbers?? The eggs were fine. A little overcooked, but edible.  Sadly, the scrambled eggs were the high point of the meal. 

When my dish was set in front of me, it looked okay, at first glance. Until I noticed the cook on the steak.  I ordered it medium rare and what I got was just this side of breathing. The server was very apologetic, and they took everything back for a do over. When I finally got my dish back, and moved the eggs off the top of it, I saw that the steak had a giant ribbon of fat running down the center. Pale white, greasy, and altogether unappetizing. It was really bad. I&apos;m not sure who they have to do their quality control, but this was an epic fail. 

At this point, the only thing I can say was that they didn&apos;t screw up my husband&apos;s eggs to terribly. We did get apologies and only had to pay for his eggs and the coffee, so there&apos;s that. Will we ever give them another shot? Chances are very very slim.","Wandered down here on a Sunday evening with a good friend. 

Food was delicious. As a vegetarian, they had a decent offering - which I always appreciate. We ordered an Endive and Pear Salad (they happily swapped the dressing here since the one it came with had anchovies in it), and some Pumpkin Gnocchi. I asked the waitress if it would be enough, since it seemed a small-plate situation, and she suggested we order another item, so we went for the Roasted Broccoli. Everything we ate was delicious. The Gnocchi was light and tender, the broccoli zingy in the best way, and the salad refreshing. But two plates would have been plenty. 

We decided to celebrate with dessert - an Olive Oil Brownie that was executed wonderfully. 

Really the ONLY thing keeping this place from 5 stars was the incessant high pitched ringing that is apparently a result of them having the heater and the music on at the same time ... That was just horrific. Almost had us out of our minds. If I&apos;d been there with my husband, rather than friend, I know he would&apos;ve have been able to stand it and we would have had to leave.... So go on a warm day, when the heater isn&apos;t necessary. At least until they get that resolved.","Came here with a brunch with a friend and her 2 year old on a Sunday and I&apos;m glad that I made reservations as it was pretty full by the time I sat down. Just FYI if you have kids, they don&apos;t have high-chairs but was able to snag a booth which worked ok for the kid. I would say their brunch menu is made up of 25% breakfast and 75% lunch so if you want breakfast food, you might not be satisfied here. Also, prices are pretty high considering most items don&apos;t come with hash browns, eggs, etc.... and for the French toast it&apos;s literally a huge chunk of bread, while delicious was $15 with just topping and syrup (some fruit would of been nice). I got the eggs benedict and it was delicious and welcomed the side salad but again, I can see some people wanting &quot;breakfast&quot; food.

Service was ok, I was waiting for my friend to show up and got seated early but would of been nice to have been brought water or asked if I wanted anything to drink (really needed coffee) and waited about 10 minutes until I was acknowledged.","WOW! This was a total surprise. I&apos;m so excited that this new place is in our hood!  I was sad when Lucia went away, not because it was that tasty but it was comfy. This place takes that cozy environment and modified it to make it even better!

Then there is the food. HOLY COW! So very good. I got their chicken dish which was off the hook good. My husband got a steak dish also amazing. Just know that when you eat here your bill is going to be heavy. It&apos;s expensive but worth every single penny.","Overall - Good drunk food that&apos;s better than McDonald&apos;s

Similar to in n out in terms of cost? Yes. Taste? Mehh.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, I like the burgers here but they&apos;re definitely more focused on speed than quality. There&apos;s a reason why you can wait a long time at an in n out drive through yet order and receive your food from Dicks in minutes. Since Dicks has a limited menu, most of the food is made prior to your order! This is good for efficiency but results in some very soggy fries if you&apos;re unlucky like me :( 

That being said if you&apos;re in the area I&apos;d still recommend trying the food here! It&apos;s cheap, there&apos;s lots of free parking and the staff were very friendly.","Pros: I frequent this Dick&apos;s location often and the customer service, friendliness, and expediency is typically top notch; depending on time of day, can get busy, but never as busy as the Capitol Hill location; spacious, free parking; special shout out for the Seahawks-themed wrapping on The Deluxe burgers today; I love everything on the menu; Dick&apos;s is simple, fresh, and satisfies my cravings; sauces now come in manufactured containers as opposed to pre-packed &quot;to-go&quot; sauce containers (not sure if it&apos;s a permanent change or COVID-related); would highly recommend/return

Cons: I never appreciated having to pay extra for sauce, even if it&apos;s just $0.05; fries are hit or miss, sometimes really good and sometimes too crispy, hard, and burnt-tasting",During my pregnancy I needed a dicks order at least once a week! COVID restrictions are being followed and safe still available to order and walk up and get anything and order normally! Classic Seattle Iconic spot,"Deluxe and cheeseburger for the win!  

Simple and no thrills.  Added bonus when you hit a fresh batch mid-day.  

Delicious sober or inebriated!!!","While
Really local, old burger shop
Look at the settings and layout
Everything was sooooooo traditional 
and the burger was so cheap and small
Really normal
I ll go back with my shake and shack","I love love!!! Simple, easy on the pocket and delicious! What more can you want? 

I love Dick&apos;s burger. The food is delicious, good portion size (smaller than usual places) but it&apos;s actually better since you can have a whole burger without worrying about portion size or control. The fries are classic. The variety of sauces are also straightforward and standard. 
I think you have to pay a little extra for sauces but that&apos;s alright since the burger itself is well priced. I didn&apos;t like their tarter sauce since it had a weird clove after taste but seems like most people get the regular ketchup, mustard and Mayo so you can easily skip the tarter sauce. I don&apos;t usually eat beef but their patties are simple and not too heavy with the bun ratio, combined, so it&apos;s the kinda burger that&apos;s right up my alley. 
The vanilla shake is oh go tasty! Reminds me vanilla ice-cream on a cone that&apos;s always in style! 
Overall, it&apos;s a no BS kinda place and that&apos;s so refreshing in today&apos;s time. I cannot wait to go back for a burger and shake soon!","Ever since I was in high school, Dick&apos;s was a spot you could go to pick up some burgers without breaking the bank.

This location is great because it has ample parking and multiple service windows helping people at one time. Even at odd-hours during the day, there is always a healthy amount of customers stopping in to pick up food to take to their next destination.

The menu isn&apos;t extensive and the food doesn&apos;t offer a ton of frills. Just old fashioned nostalgia served in greasy wrappings with the toppings falling out with every bite.The burgers are standard, and though I haven&apos;t had them while intoxicated, I&apos;ve heard they&apos;re the perfect drunk food late at night. Though it comes in two sizes, the double pattied version isn&apos;t gigantic, so you&apos;ll be satisfied, but not carrying it around with you for the rest of the day.

Service isn&apos;t the warmest, but they get you in and out pretty quick. Though they have limited seating for COVID, it&apos;s much more enjoyable to take your food to a nearby park or enjoy from the comforts of your car just to be safe.","One of my favorite places to grab milkshakes, burgers, and fries! Quick and easy. Definitely recommend this place for their food!","This is a UW college kid favorite. It&apos;s like the In n Out of Washington! If you are craving a quick, juicy, cheap burger..look no further! The set up of this place mimics the food court at an amusement park -- you wait in parallel lines outside the shop and get your food instantly at the counter right as you order! The parking lot is not huge but we managed to find a spot right up front! We ordered one deluxe burger, one special burger, fries, and 2 kids cones. They have condiments that come on the side (for 5 cents) as they want to minimize the customization and get food out as quick as possible! We got pretty much all of them for a low 30 cents!

The fries are delicious -- perfectly crisp and have a decent amount of salt on them :) The cones come in a bunch of different flavors and are under $2 so if you are feeling like some ice cream go for it. Just remember that you get everything at once so you may be eating dessert before your meal to avoid a mess :-) 

Definitely not by any means a fancy place, but for a quick burger at a great price point.. you can&apos;t beat it!","Seriously not a huge fan of Dick&apos;s. I personally think it&apos;s overrated. A lot of my friends have been telling us it&apos;s a must-eat in Seattle but I&apos;m quite disappointed. 

The service wasn&apos;t that great, the staff went away to grab the burgers while we were still ordering and they missed some of our orders. The burgers were dry and VERY normal. The fries were soggy, greasy and cold.

I guess if would be a great drunk food place to go considering it&apos;s open till midnight but I would not go back again just for their burgers.","Dick&apos;s Drive-In is always my go-to when I need burgers. I got Deluxe and fries. My friend also got Deluxe and chocolate shakes. As always, the burgers are tasty. It doesn&apos;t come with a big size, but it&apos;s always tasty when I&apos;m craving for a late night snack. The fries was ok. The chocolate shakes was already melting when DoorDash delivered at our door.","One of those spots that is iconic in seattle. Good quality, inexpensive, fast as fuck burgers and fries and shakes. For $10 you can buy pretty much the whole menu. Only thing they&apos;re missing is more veggie options on the burger - but besides that I love these burgers to death.","I&apos;m not sure what the big hope is about eating at a Dicks Drive in!?
Food is extremely unhealthy and greasy and the lines are always way too long and parking just flat out sucks. And there&apos;s always homeless people begging for money at this location and the Capitol Hill location. Maybe it&apos;s because prices are relatively affordable??

You can&apos;t custom order anything on there menu. It&apos;s pretty much you get what they will make you. At least the staff are friendly most of the time","Great place to go for a quick lunch, fries are amazing hand cut and fried. Burgers are mediocre but cheap and milkshakes are tasty. COVID precautions are good, and it has always been an outdoor thing that you get your food and eat In your car.overall 4 stars for great shakes fries and prices and mediocre burgers","Call me a biased Seattleite if you wish, but Dick&apos;s is the greatest fast food burger around. I rarely crave fast food burgers but Dick&apos;s is an exception--a deluxe and fries ALWAYS sound good! The deluxe is super flavorful and never lets me down.

Dick&apos;s is fast, cheap, and a shining beacon of hope after late night shenanigans. What&apos;s not to love?","OK, I looked these guys up and they&apos;re supposed to be in the top 10 for burgers in Seattle. Honestly I was very unimpressed. The burgers are very lackluster, small, the taste is unimaginative. The burger taste like they have thousand Island dressing on it also. The service is fast, the staff was friendly, but I didn&apos;t come here for a smile, came for good food. The fries are limp like you make it home, but they had decent taste. I drove up here to the original store from Tacoma and was just plain disappointed.","I don&apos;t normally go 5 stars for fast food but this is Dick&apos;s! It is a Seattle thing so if you aren&apos;t from Seattle you might not understand. 

Simple, tasty burger, slightly squishy but that is the way it should be. Greasy, tasty, home-cut fries. And their special fry sauce. I&apos;ve been away for a while but I swear the fry sauce is a bit different. I taste a hint of cloves. Still delish and still the best grab and go, late-night, local grub in town!","TLDR; fast food burger joint. It&apos;s cheap, opens late, and food comes out really fast. 

I was a little skeptical about eating here. Coming from California, where we have In n Out, Five Guys, the Habit...how was this place going to compare? It seemed to be a more jank Mcdonald&apos;s. But it was late at night, and this was the closest thing that was open so why not give it a shot. 

First off, this location doesn&apos;t have an indoor seating area. Unless you want to eat outside where there&apos;s no cover from the sun/rain, then you&apos;ll have to eat in the car or take it to go. 

Second, everything is pre made. At least my burger wasn&apos;t made fresh. I was watching the workers prep my order and just saw them grab a burger out of a metal tray. I remember feeling kind of disappointed. i also thought it was really interesting how they charge you for condiments but it&apos;s only 5 cents so it&apos;s not too bad. 

Dick&apos;s Deluxe: I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, it did look kind of sad when I unwrapped it but the taste was better than its appearance. For the price we paid, it could&apos;ve tasted a lot worse. 

Fries: Fries were whatever, it seemed like they were also cooked ahead of time. They were very soggy but tasted fine. Just wish they were freshly cooked. 

Don&apos;t knock it till you try it! Seems like a good place to go after a night out drinking too.","This place has OK burgers (in my opinion). I tried the Dick&apos;s Deluxe Burger and it was ok, it was also not warm at all. The French fries tasted like they have been sitting out for a long time and it was very greasy (normal burger places that I like will take about 10-15 mins to make, but Dicks only took like a second and the order is ready). The staff and location are nice, but the food is not that good, I have had better.","Guess what I had for dinner ??? Yup Dick&apos;s, but this time it is Not regular burgers. I&apos;ve got (3) cheeseburgers and like before I added fries onto my cheeseburgers. To glued and make a little bit more tasty to them cheeseburgers is ketchup. Pretty good dinner for tonight.","I ordered from here through Waiter.com. The food should probably be four stars, but there are a couple of bad reviews that need to be offset. They are much better than two stars. People need to realize that getting a place one star means that they probably should not be a restaurant. And these guys certainly have good food","Pretty sure that I got food poisoning from them. My tacos may look appetizing in the photograph, but the meat was rubbery and clearly mechanically cubed. The guacamole tasted like it was prepackaged and had such a smooth texture it reminded me of baby food. I tried to obtain a refund but was only offered credit towards another order. After the night I had, I did not avail myself of that particular offer.",I wish I could give negative stars. I ordered some fish and shrimp tacos and they never included the shrimp tacos. The fish tacos were also SOGGY and UNDER COOKED and avocado was BLACK. Literally disgusting I just threw them away. I called to try to get a refund but the manager refused. I hope they go out of business. Nasty food. Horrible customer service. DO NOT EAT HERE.,"Waited an hour and a half for UberEATS to deliver this.  It was cold, the chips were the basic rounds you will get from 7/11 knock off brand. And salsa was Tostitos. Ordered carne Asada tacos and got ground beef which I don&apos;t see on the menu.

This place is worse than Taco Bell.","After reading the first couple of reviews, I was wishing I had checked Yelp before ordering but thankfully I was pleasantly surprised! I got the deluxe quesadilla and it was delicious, the meat was a little smoky which gave it a unique taste. The salsa was also good and had a nice amount of heat so they must have upped their salsa game as well. I recommend, especially for the prices and the quantity you get for it!","Ordered this on UberEATS, the burrito was tasteless. Felt like I was eating cardboard.","We stopped at Duke&apos;s for happy hour last night and it did not disappoint.

Atmosphere: Very chill and welcoming atmosphere with great views of Lake Union. The facilities felt clean and abided by COVID rules with servers masked up. 

Food: The happy hour deal is great. We loved both the clam and the lobster chowder, with the latter being one of the better cups of soup I&apos;ve tried. The crab cakes are all crab and no filler, which is outstanding. They come with a great avocado-based topping and an aioli-type sauce that we loved. Fried prawns with sweet and sour sauce were a great weekend guilty pleasure.

We will be back for many more happy hours and dinners alike. Love this place, can&apos;t recommend it enough.","There is a reason this is an old school staple in Seattle and the chef has a seafood cookbook. It&apos;s seriously just good and I have eaten here many times and tried many things. 

The Rockfish Tacos are always good and relatively light. The Salmon Sliders are my go-to for happy hour. The salmon comes on an open-faced toasted piece of baguette with a pesto sauce...sounds different, but it&apos;s delicious! The Cesar salad is classic, but I always add Salmon. Hell pro-tip: when in doubt at Duke&apos;s, add salmon! And of course the salmon entrees are great, and always ask about the specials. 

Every time I have been to Duke&apos;s the bar was always busy, a testament to the great drinks they serve up. Obviously COVID puts a damper on this, but hey try and support the bartenders by showing up and ordering. They hire some great cocktail crafters and we want to keep them going! 

I&apos;d tell you about dessert, but I think at Duke&apos;s a great cocktail always ends up being my finale! You can&apos;t go wrong with a traditional Manhattan, Old Fashioned, or a gin martini.","I&apos;ve been to two other Duke&apos;s, but my first visit to this location. I was searching for a restaurant with a large patio, and this place fit my needs during this COVID time.  Not only do they have a large patio, they generously spaced their tables, and a continued breezy from Lake Union kept the air flowing.  This was my first at-restaurant meal since the shut down, and I found the PERFECT location.

Staff had mask on.  At the front, there&apos;s a QR code that you can scan to get the menu and avoid touching paper.  Or just surf online.  That&apos;s what I did.  

Food wise.  It&apos;s always reliable and consistent.  Their crab cake is wonderful.  Have it by itself, on a salad, or commonly ordered as a sandwich.  We had the crab cake sandwich combo with the lobster bisque. The unchopped seafood salad (ordered Duke&apos;s way, which is chopped) is delicious and light, not drowning in dressing.  Be sure to save room for their warm sourdough bread.  It&apos;s fantastic bread. 

A minor nitpick is that there&apos;s no free parking.  Currently the city of Seattle is charging only $0.50 an hour, which is cheaper than paying for the lot immediately outside.  The slightly farther aisle by the retaining wall is city parking.  Park there instead.  ;)","Great outdoor patio overlooking Union lake. We sampled a variety of dishes for a weekday lunch: prawns with avocado salad, salmon sliders, deviled eggs, lobster chowder and a North by Northwest chowder. 

With the exception of the North by Northwest chowder, everything tasted great. Our order also came with a loaf of delicious and warm sourdough bread. Our service overall was friendly, speedy, and the restaurant had a relaxed atmosphere.","Their outdoor seating is heated but still very cold. 

I ordered the calamari, chowder and got some sourdough bread with butter. The calamari and chowder was great! The sourdough was great too, but the butter was terrible. It felt like it was margarine. It was so hard and not spreadable. If I&apos;m paying this much for food I&apos;d like some mixed smooth butter.  Instead of these blocks of unappealing ice.","Very cool atmosphere and indoor seating! There is outdoor seating with heat lamps and amazing views of the water and boats!

The bread is to die for ...no joke, get three plates of it.

The award winning clam chowder was probably the best calm chowder I&apos;ve had in Seattle! I am from the Northeast and it take a lot for chowder to blow my mind and this did just that.

We got the berry dessert and I highly recommend it.

Request Gustavo, he was the server we had and he made our experience truly special. 

The only reason I didn&apos;t give Duke&apos;s a five star rating is due to some of their prices and the average crab dip. A few dishes seemed over priced. 

Overall, incredible dining experience with a great staff!","We were on a hunt for chowder when we came to visit Seattle. I don&apos;t eat bacon and most of the clam chowders are all made with bacon. So we chose Duke&apos;s because the offered a lobster chowder made with no bacon. Our first time, we ordered bread bowls to go and ate at home. It was to die for. Such a deep and creamy flavor, I didn&apos;t miss the clam chowder. We ended up coming again and ate in the restaurant outdoors. Everyone loved the food. We tried many dishes, but one of my favorites is their crab cakes. It&apos;s mostly crab and not other fillings. It&apos;s important to note you&apos;ll spend at least $25-$30 per person for dinner, if not more with tax and tip. I was sad to see they only offered one pasta dish and it was like $36. So again, I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d come back except for the chowder.","Seafood was fresh. Quality was there. 

I would come back for HH if I am in town. 

Great view of the marina, you can see sea planes land and take off.

HH starts at 3 on Sunday, you get a few dollars off the dinner menu prices. 

They bring sour dough bread to your table to start. 

Crab Cake is a must try. So much sheared crab, wish they were crab chunks but it was still amazing with the chipotle sauce.

Oysters weren&apos;t my favorite they don&apos;t bring out horseradish and I asked for some and it wasn&apos;t spicy. There was greenish looking ice that went on it, we weren&apos;t big fans. 

Seafood on the seafood salad was great, was t a big fan of the dressing though. 

Service was attentive and everything came out in a reasonable about of time.","First dinner eating outside in Seattle after moving, and wow, this place is amazing. I&apos;d say that this place offers a blessing in disguise moment in the midst of the pandemic, as if you just dine in, you&apos;d simply miss the lovely Seattle waterfront views! I can probably imagine outdoor reservations can be difficult to get during normal times, so take advantage of that. Besides, sufficiently heated patios!

We ordered a blood orange cocktail, 2 pc fish and chips, salmon sliders, seafood grill that features the un crab cake, and the coconut shrimp. All of these were delicious and fresh, though take note that, after many days of just eating at home, the food is very rich and filling. Prices are a bit high which is a slight downside, but quality is there as well as the ambience priced in. The salmon in the salmon sliders is cooked well and is smooth and juicy. I specifically loved the crab cakes as it is majority crab meat (almost all, to be honest) and as they say, there&apos;s not much filling at all. It&apos;s carefully prepared and with full of herbs. I also did a taste test (ordered) a clam chowder to compare to the pike place one, and while this one is less creamy, it is definitely much better seasoned, so take your pick. There&apos;s no one best chowder in Seattle I&apos;d say, just preference. Fish and chips were above average, and there&apos;s a lot more fish than fries which gives a good balance of nutrition (for something not that healthy haha). I&apos;d probably still prefer Ivar&apos;s for fish and chips especially due to the value, while the rest of the dishes here would be the highlights here. 

Service is excellent, and I can imagine I will come back, especially for certain special occasions. The waterfront view just can&apos;t beat. 

Just note that as of the time of writing (around thanksgiving week 2020), the main road leading to Duke&apos;s is closed for construction, but they are still open and you can find nearby parking about 5 or so minutes walk away (for free in Sundays).","If you&apos;re looking for a nice seafood restaurant to celebrate any occasion, Duke&apos;s is a great choice. Located right along the water with great views of Lake Union, the ambiance is pretty cool here. As soon as you walk through the door, take a look up and you&apos;ll see a boat serving as the roof for the grand staircase. Pretty neat!

The menu can seem a bit overwhelming but I would suggest getting a combo so you can try multiple things. The combo I got allowed me to get a bowl of their famous clam chowder and a black cod fish taco. The clam chowder was superb. It wasn&apos;t overly creamy and hit the spot! The black cod was prepared well but I wasn&apos;t too fond of the tortilla which broke quite easily.

In all, Duke&apos;s is a classy spot for seafood with great views of Lake Union.","Knock on wood, we have had nothing but great experiences here. Hubs and I have birthdays 10 days apart, so we have come back here on both days for a few years now, and it&apos;s always been top notch food and service, and having a great view of the bay doesn&apos;t hurt either. My go-to tends to be either the crab cake entree, or the grilled combo platter of crab cake, prawns, and scallops. For an appetizer, we love the prawns Cabo wabo, and I can never go there and not have their signature Bloody Mary. For dessert, if you love chocolate, their brownie is not to be missed (it&apos;s more like a chocolate lava cake), topped with vanilla ice cream.","Duke&apos;s seafood never disappoints! With outdoor seating you get a nice view and space heating. I highly recommend checking their website and signing up for the mail list to get any deals they are running. We got a buy one get one and ended up getting both types of tacos. Firstly, the tacos are massive, tortillas extra crunchy and fillings flavorful. The coleslaw in it was at the edge of being a bit too sweet for me but I didn&apos;t mind because everything was so delicious! I tried a bit of their chowder too and got complementary bread and butter to go with it. Flavor bombs all the way!",This place was so dang delicious. The atmosphere is romantic. Our server was really good. We enjoyed a delicious meal. Started off with a blueberry lemon martini. So good. We ordered their bread and butter. The bread is a sourdough loaf with a crispy exterior and soft on the inside. Whipped butter. Yum. We ordered some of their chowders. You can order small tasters instead of one big bowl if you&apos;d like. Fun! We had their seafood chowder and their clam chowder. They came in small seashell bowls. Loved it! They have a great oyster selection. I enjoyed three different oysters :-) my husband got the crab Louie salad. Came with a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. I ordered the macadamia encrusted halibut. This was so good folks. I forgot to take a picture of the desert we enjoyed. It was a delicious chocolate brownie concoction with vanilla ice cream. What a wonderful meal.,Dukes exceeded my expectations and I&apos;ve found one of my top five favorite desserts here. I started with the clam chowder which has plenty of clam and bacon. The potatoes were diced small and the cream base was well seasoned. The sour dough bread that came to the table was perfect for sopping up all of the chowder. We also had the coco loco prawns which were very crispy and flavorful. The coconut and the Asian inspired dipping sauce were a great pair. For lunch I had the fish and chips. The fish was cod that was fresh and meaty with a well seasoned breading. The chips were potato wedges style and yummy. The best part of the meal was the marionberry pie. Top five dessert in life here. The pie crust was flaky and the Dutch crumble topping was not overly sweet. The Marionberry filling was rich and tasted like a blueberry married a blackberry. I&apos;ll dream of this pie for years to come. I&apos;ll be back in Seattle for it for sure,"Old school environment, yummy food and great drinks! A bit pricey, but worth it for the clam chowder!","After almost 6 months of shelter in place, I finally ventured out for outdoor dining and couldn&apos;t have imagined a better place to do so than Duke&apos;s on SLU! The restaurant has an adorable nautical vibe, a beautiful patio overlooking the water, perfectly batter fried seafood and fries, pretty drinks, great service (shoutout to Lacey!), and excellent value for money. The must-order here is the $36, 3 course dinner that comes with a choice of chowder, side salad, and entree. This is the perfect place to catch the sunset and a meal after a day out on the water!

1) Service (+): The restaurant is very clean (I saw the staff disinfecting each table after they leave), all the staff were wearing masks and gloves, and our server, Lacey, was super friendly and accommodating, and she checked in with us throughout the meal to make sure we were being taken care of.  

2) Ambiance (+): This might be my new favorite patio in Seattle (it&apos;s in a close tie with Ray&apos;s Boathouse) and you can catch views of the Aurora bridge, Gas Works Park, and the Seattle skyline. It was also clean, socially distanced from other parties, spacious and warm (there are many heat lamps).

3) Food (+): My friends and I all ordered the 3 course dinner and it was phenomenal. I chose the Caesar salad, clam chowder, and 2 piece fish &amp; chips - all of which were amazing. Our order also came with freshly baked, warm sour dough bread with butter that melted perfectly. 

4) Alcohol/Drinks (+): There is a large selection of beers and cocktails here. I opted for the blood orange margarita, which was very summery and fruity. 

5) Value for Money (+): The prices here are amazing, especially with the million dollar view and sunset you get!","Even in these tough times, Duke&apos;s delivered a wonderful night as we dined in the restaurant.  These poor servers are woking their butts off so it&apos;ll be nice when they can get a little more help in.  Nevertheless, our server was timely, polite and hard working. Our dinners were served on time and perfect temperatures.  The Copper Creek salmon was possibly the best salmon I&apos;ve ever had. We had the Kentucky Bourbon Glazed version.  We also tried the top  3 chowders. Wow! No wonder its award winning.  Great experience.  So glad they were open and braving to serve!","It&apos;s a great time to visit Duke&apos;s! The outdoor patio, and expansive windows, give a great view of lake union and the docks. I came in for dinner with a group of friends and it was fantastic. I tried the salmon sandwich with avocado on rosemary bread and oh my goodness! Delicious. And i love sweet potato fries so no need to sell me on that! The rest of my group got burgers and fish tacos, everyone was happy! It was a little pricey, $30 for a sandwich with fries, but it&apos;s great quality food and the ambiance is perfect for a date or a friends night out!","I&apos;ve tried this place and another restaurant. I love Duke&apos;s clam chowder the best! 

It has this herbaceous flavor profile instead of buttery or fishy taste you might get in some places. I really liked that strong herb taste because it was memorable. One thing I wish is that they offer it in a larger size because the one I got was too small for me. I was definitely savoring each bite of that chowder.

Also, their sourdough bread is delicious! It was soft in the inside while the outside has that perfect crust. It was good with the chowder and also eating it the next day for breakfast with the butter they provided.","The new location is incredible, and now offers an oyster bar! There is a paid parking lot located right outside of the establishment. The outdoor seating views of the lake union are breathtaking at sunset. The Duke&apos;s famous Bloody Mary lives up to its name, and is honestly of the best I&apos;ve had in Seattle! Their traditional clam chowder is absolutely delicious and packed with flavor! Their fish and chips (pretty standard) are panko crusted, so a little different from a traditional beer batter. They tend to have some special items that are not listed on the menu (always ask). Whether you&apos;re taking out-of-town relatives to dinner or grabbing a quick happy hour with friends, this is the perfect place! Cheers!","BEST COCKTAILS EVER!!! &amp; TO GO DRINKS/GROWLERS 

I discovered dreamland a couple of months ago and I&apos;m HOOKED on their cocktails. My personal favs are the tiger blood margarita and seasonal mule! Also their French fries are so good, I need to come back and try the breakfast. 

The menu doesn&apos;t have the cocktail growlers on it anymore but you can pick up a 1 liter grower for $55 and save $5 if you bring it back for a refill :) 

Seriously everyone who works there is so friendly. Go support these guys, they opened an awesome bar at the beginning of covid and deserve all the support!! 

*One thing to note is that they&apos;ve been changing their hours &amp; days open so google and whatnot is not always accurate.  Give them a call beforehand to verify if they are open. They actively post on Instagram so that&apos;s a good bet.","Dreamland cocktails can&apos;t be beat - the tigers blood margarita will change your life. It&apos;s been single handedly carrying me through this pandemic.

The staff is great and will always greet you with generosity and good energy.","I was really happy to have a temperature check upon entry the first time I visited - very appreciative of additional precaution at a time when many businesses are letting their guards down. The next time I went (later at night) no temp was taken. I&apos;m sure there is some pushback from customers, but I would love to see this be consistent. 

The space is beautifully refreshed. I have a lot of nostalgia for Red Door, but it had started to feel a bit sleepy and stale, even pre-Covid. Dreamland has imbued new life into this gorgeous building. The hallway in particular served some disco realness- I recommend going to the bathrooms even if you don&apos;t have to use them, just to see it. 

It&apos;s a rare thing to find a place that picks a theme and carries it all the way through- from the disco hall vibe to the music, this whole place really has a consistent feel. 

Service was excellent on both visits.

Cocktails were great, beer seemed a bit overpriced given the neighborhood/selection. Food was not particularly memorable, but I need to try it again to form a proper opinion. Reviews to me are not set in stone- based on my current experience I&apos;m feeling closer to 4 stars than 5, but I&apos;ll update on additional visits!","Following an eye appointment, I decided to head towards Fremont. Arrived a bit early back on 8/20/20, but once I was allowed to enter Dreamland Bar and Diner...wow what a transformation from the former Red Door! 

I took various interior shots for Yelp Nation, while I was waiting for my order.

I sat solo al fresco, the summer breeze was welcoming. The boisterous 4 top behind me, especially one person heavy on the perfume, not so much. Kind of took away from the overall dining experience. 

I did eat every bite of my meal, rarely I have steak and eggs ($17). I wished though the 8 oz NY steak was medium rare, not medium and the over easy eggs were yolky not over hard.  No issues with accompanying toast and hash browns. This definitely hit the spot though and pretty much keep me fueled for the rest of the day. Service was decent and I was kept well hydrated.","This place was a total disappointment based on the high reviews. I was super excited to come here to try the food but left feeling unsatisfied and a little angry.

My friends and I came on Saturday for lunch and only had to wait behind one group so it was nice. This is the first place that did temperature check so I was pleasantly surprised and was happy that it was starting on a good note 

However, once we sat down, everything kinda just went downhill. It took about 10 minutes for a waitress to come by to take our orders. Took another 40 minutes for our food to come out! Once we got our food, I was hungry and was excited to try them but it was nothing spectacular:

Friends order: chicken and waffle - probably the only thing that had some good in it, the waffle was crispy and the chicken had good flavor.

The mushroom scramble: &quot;standard&quot; according to my friend

Our order: waffle dogs and the Duke: waffle dog was not crispy, it was pretty flimsy and the weiner was Soo tiny. My friend had to cut the waffle dog half way before she even got a piece! The only saving grace was the sauces that it came with. 
The Duke: this was such a one note dish: everything was mushy, I couldn&apos;t tell that there was bacon in it until I re-read the menu, and the bread that was at the bottom was already soggy from the sauce and it was bland.

Overall, maybe I came on an off day but Im not sure where the high ratings are coming from...","for the love of all that is good, drop what you are doing right now and go to dreamland. Everything about this place is absolutely spectacular. no matter who greets you or seats you, you will feel like they are your best friend who has known you forever. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever felt so... Welcome at a restaurant before.

The service does not drop off once you get seated. It&apos;s attentive, energetic, and fun. And fast. I love the way the menu is categorized, things like breakfast and not breakfast. Fun and whimsy seems to define everything about the dreamland.

But let&apos;s get to it, the food. Where do I begin? I had the mushroom scramble which was absolutely outrageous. I was worried first because... Brussels sprouts in my eggs? The answer is a resounding hell yes please.  And my kid ordered the Duke and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever seen him eat so quickly in his entire life. He devoured it and could not stop talking about how much he enjoyed, of all things, the tomatoes that were in the meal. It was perfection.

I also had the guava Mamosa and, guess what? Delicious. I feel like I could eat there every day and be very happy","This place was a dream come true! We ordered the monte Christo sandwich and the pork shoulder hash, both were mouth watering delicious, the monte Christo was the best I ever had, it has a corn flake crust that gave it that right amount of crunch, Do your taste buds a favor and come here, not only was the food delicious but the servers and the hostess and the bartender were  all incredibly nice! And the decor was SO cute","Love Dreamland&apos;s versatile and thoughtful layout: there&apos;s a spot for any time of day and occasion. Social distance with outdoor seating on the patio (dogs allowed) for a sunny brunch, or opt for indoors to fun disco hallways &amp; Halloween decor. 
The servers are rockstars for keeping an upbeat attitude despite the dinner rush, explaining the drinks to us, and splitting our bill 5-ways. 

The food was less impressive: fries were jerk-seasoned but bland.  
3/5  Chicken &amp; waffles: I liked the creative twist on using a bubble waffle mold, but the cornmeal batter made it so heavy; and the chicken had some bitter, burnt edges.

The cocktails make this spot worth the visit. My friends really enjoyed the passionfruit whiskey sour, guava mule, and grasshopper (tastes like a Thin Min slushie!).","The appetizers were really good, brunch was amazing and the customer service was impeccable. The staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating. I will definitely be coming back again","Great food, drinks and service! Popped in on a Saturday, originally the wait time was 30 minutes. We only waited about 10. Our waitress was amazing and helpful. Spacious restaurant with proper Covid protocols.","Such a unique place! They have so many fun Halloween decorations here that put you into the spirit. They have a great food/ drink menu, too.","The best brunch in Seattle! Such a fun vibe, and the staff is very friendly. I got the Tiger&apos;s Blood Margarita and had to get a second because it was so delicious. The avocado toast was fantastic as well, and the beignets were a nice sweet touch to our meal. I will definitely be coming back soon!","It&apos;s a great space with a large indoor and large outdoor patio. Offers both brunch and non brunch things. The drinks are just as strong as the ones they serve at stampede which is a huge plus. The food is flavorful and so many options! 

Ordered the fish tacos and the mushroom omelette- and both were amazing! The tortillas were toasted and the fish was cooked to perfection. The omelette had perfectly cooked eggs, a nice side salad and hash browns. Definitely recommend the mango habenero sauce!!! It&apos;s so spicy but so flavorful and soooo good. If you can&apos;t handle spicy, don&apos;t put too much. 

Also ordered passion fruit whisky sour- so good: do not skip this. The margarita was a little too sour for me but still good. 

Also ordered the waffle corn dog and the chicken fingers on the happy hour menu. The corn dog had a sausage for the meat base which disappointed me a little. But the chicken fingers were amazing. Flavorful, tender and sooo juicy. 10/10 recommend.","I love the COVID-19 precautions that they take here to make me feel like I&apos;m being taken care of. The drinks that they have on the menu are fantastic, delicious and also strong. You literally can&apos;t go wrong with anything on the menu. I got the fried chicken with egg waffle and man, it was delicious. the egg waffle was nice and crispy and the fried chicken was flavorful. Everyone finished their food on the table. Service was great. I would come back again with my dog (it is dog friendly on the patio).","Dreamland is an amazing experience! 
They put thought into every aspect of what they&apos;re doing. 
The food is PERFECT for brunches and the dinner menu is just as good. The drinks! The drinks are amazing and you&apos;ll want to try them all! 
The staff, is maybe the best part, everyone is nice, professional, and playful and I can just feel them smiling behind those masks. 
You should pick this bar when going out with people and let me tell you why! It feels like you&apos;re in another dimension, even though the staff is obviously taking COVID very seriously - I almost forgot it was happening because it was such a fun atmosphere. 
Definitely the best bar in Seattle.","Friendly Atmosphere, safe procedures taken loved the fun creative decorations. Definitely lives up to it&apos;s name. Food is seasoned and paired perfectly with sauces . Sweet and savory Chicken . I&apos;m drooling all over again just writing about this.","If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I&apos;ve been here 3 times now and the service is above and beyond. The first time I went I thought maybe it was a one time thing, but no, the people who work here are just incredibly nice and so good at their jobs--especially during such a difficult time for the industry. The drinks are phenomenal, tigersblood margarita is the best but I also highly recommend the guava mule and passion fruit whiskey sour. I&apos;ve also had the chicken fingers which are much fancier than you&apos;d expect, I&apos;d call it more along the lines of amazing fried chicken, and the fries are so good too. They also went all out with Halloween decor. All in all I can&apos;t recommend this place enough--the food, drinks and people are all amazing. Best bar I&apos;ve been to in a long time, and I&apos;ll be back many of times.","Great service from Johnny (hope i spelled that right)!  They were very accommodating even though they had a wait, took out temperature to make sure we were safe, and practiced social distancing. The decor right now is awesome (ScreamLand) and the food presentation was way nicer than i thought it was going to be :). I ordered the truffle Parmesan fries that normally come with the steak frites, but Johnny was really helpful and let me order just the fries no problem. Great service, awesome ambience, yummy drinks, highly recommend. Will be back!","Dreamland is definitely dreamy, especially with all the attention to the seasonal Halloween decor. It&apos;s a WAY over-the-top fun atmosphere!  My friends and I were looking forward to trying a new, fun place, and by the looks of things, this was it!

1) Take our temperature at the door     check
2) Greeted promptly and cheerfully by waitstaff     check
3) Drinks brought to the table quickly     check
4) QR code scan for the touchless menu    check (great idea btw!)
5) Food orders arrive promptly and cheerfully     check 

So why only 3 stars. The food.
(Atmosphere: FIVE STARS, without a doubt!) 

I am VERY forgiving, and not super picky. (Again, the service was on point) I want this place to succeed, and it probably will on atmosphere and drinks all on their own. But don&apos;t go here expecting the food to match the exceptional atmosphere. By reading the other reviews, you&apos;ll notice most of the positive comments are about the atmosphere and drinks. The food: notsomuch. So...I&apos;m not alone on this.

I ordered the &quot;Mushroom Scramble&quot;. The mushrooms, leeks and brussel sprouts were overcooked, colorless, and the overall taste of the dish was very bland. The hashbrowns that I had requested to be &quot;very well cooked and browned&quot;, arrived nearly colorless, barely cooked, over salted and swimming in grease.

I did not say anything at the table, as the restaurant choice was made by one of my companions and I didn&apos;t want them to feel bad about his suggestion about where to dine.

One friends&apos; comment about his selection of biscuits and gravy:  &quot;It was adequate...not stellar...missing that certain something&quot;

My other friend did like his selection: &quot;The Duke was tasty and I liked it... [but] for a place that serves breakfast all day, I kinda expected a few more unique items on the menu&quot;

Both said that their bloody mary&apos;s were WAAAY too spicy.

So....one out of the three of us enjoyed the food.

Still, maybe give it a try for the atmosphere and service, if not the food. I will be back mainly because I believe in giving a restaurant at least a second chance. We all have off days. Plus, the disco ball hallway alone is worth the trip!",Food was amazing! Service was great! They had such an amazing energy about them. Love this place. I got the eggs Benedict with Avacado and tomato and it was delicious. Today was the first day they opened and they killed it! Will be back,"A big thank you to fellow Yelpers Nate and Rebecca for putting Stone Way Cafe on my radar screen! I knew this location previously as Tiny Ninja from ages ago. First visit today to SWC (2/21/21), close to several other food and drink establishments on 35th and Stone Way.

Sunday coming up on noon there was a bit of a masked, socially distanced line. Currently only via takeout orders with available outdoor sidewalk seating. Don&apos;t let the line discourage you. SWC is well staffed at the barista station and kitchen line. The coffee beverages and food orders are filled with spot on efficiency.

Two breakfast burritos ($16 total, pre tax &amp; tip) with sausage ($3 extra) was a bit of overkill. Half of one burrito is huge and packed with tasty ingredients. Easily shareable, enough for leftovers, or perfect for a hearty appetite after a lengthy bike ride on the nearby Burke Gilman Trail.

I am getting reacquainted with this area where Northlake, Wallingford, and Fremont  converge and close to my new worksite.

Think of a golden arches breakfast burrito on mega steroids made with quality ingredients.","What just happened in my mouth. 
I was shopping at evo and we decided to pop in to grab breakfast and eat on their patio. Coffee was great, but the breakfast... are you kidding me. It was so freaking good. We now drive over to Fremont just to eat here.","I came here several times for lunch, it&apos;s always pretty busy, because the food is so good here! It was a little more difficult to get a table during pre-covid time, because a lot of people came here with laptop and the place was always full. It was a lot easier to get a table during covid and tables are pretty spread out. 
Pretty much everything here is great, just name a few: biscuit &amp; gravy, salmon taco, breakfast burrito.  A great place to come back to try different things!","After seeing a plethora of really good reviews/pictures from other Yelpers, I had a huge hankering for a good breakfast burrito and or biscuit sandwich. I placed an order online Sunday morning, and it was ready for pick up after 8:35 AM. It was a quick 10 minute drive over (you can also order delivery through UberEats, Door Dash, GrubHub). They have easy 3 minute food parking up front. 

I waited for a minute before I could get into the store to pick up my order. It was ready and brought out right away, and then I was on my way home. I ordered the breakfast burrito, the Rosalia&apos;s Bisocho, and the granola yogurt parfait. The breakfast burrito is HEAFTY. You pick it up, and you immediately know it&apos;s going to be a massive meal. I love the marks on the outside of the burrito and how it&apos;s a little crisp. Great finishing touch. It&apos;s a very heavy meal. The cheese is melty and really good. We liked it enough, but it wasn&apos;t our favorite. We did throw on some hot sauce. It is a little pricey, but again, this thing is massive and 100% worth the price. 

Roaslia&apos;s Biscocho was AMAZING. Highly recommended. That cheddar jalapeno biscuit was fantastic. It was fluffy, buttery, and flavorful. It would eat it by itself if I could. Everything inside of the biscuit was so good. We couldn&apos;t stop eating it. It came with a side of potatoes which was MASSIVE too. Take out potatoes are never as good as when they&apos;re fresh, but that&apos;s not really their fault. It was a little bland. 

The yogurt and granola was fine. I probably wouldn&apos;t get it again. It is a decent size though! Can&apos;t wait to come back here again to try out more of their breakfast items. I have my eye on the cuban sandwich and cajun benedict next.","This place was ok...but there are better options for breakfast take out.

We ordered online.  Eggs Benedict and Pancakes with Bacon for pick up.  I showed up at the asked for time, but had to wait an additional 20 minutes.  There were others in line for pick up and the organization seemed to be teetering on the verge of being in the weeds.

Pancakes were good.  They were a good texture.  Not too fluffy, but not too stiff.  There was a good vanilla taste, not overwhelming.

Bacon was thick cut.  But gross.  Greasy and cold.  Pretty sure they had pre cooked it and put it in a tin on the line and just thrown it in the box without any additional attention.  I paid too much money for it and I definitely wouldn&apos;t recommend anyone ever order it again.

Eggs Benedict had a good flavor to the hollandaise, but some dumbf*ck poured it all over the inside of the box, which made a total mess of everything and the english muffins gummy and not something I want to eat again.  The eggs were overcooked to the point that the yolks were green and powdery.  Ham was thick cut.

I paid roughly $40-ish.  I would recommend the iHop, Tommy&apos;s, or Huckleberry Square instead.","So I went to Stone Way Cafe this morning. It wasn&apos;t as busy as usual however I was really uncomfortable with my visit today due to two incidents. I ordered a medium size cortado, I was charged $4.13 and the staff did take my order. I gave a 15% tip. However after waiting for 15 mins, still no sign of my cortado. Three customers came after me already got their orders. I asked the staff and she told me she didn&apos;t get the order but she&apos;ll make the cortado. However, when I got my cortado, it didn&apos;t come in medium size. It was a small cup. Totally not what I ordered.

I didn&apos;t see other people&apos;s orders being forgotten. I also think the staff should confirm exactly what my order was before just went about and made it. I used to think this place is a nice place to hang out with friends, but I&apos;m not so sure now and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll revisit again. Hopefully this experience won&apos;t happen to other people.","Wanted a breakfast burrito but settled for a jalape√±o biscuit. I was swayed by the description of the ROSALIA&apos;S BISCOCHO of heat plus egg plus avocado on a biscuit. I ordered through DD so not sure if that contributes to the quality when I got it. I was let down tbh. The sandwich tasted flavorless despite all the ingredients. However, I saved half for the next day and it actually tasted better reheated. The home fries are delicious.
The salmon tacos were tasty and a nice mix of heat. Surprised they used sockeye!","Delicious food! The breakfast burrito with bacon, Cuban sandwich, turkey wrap, all so good!
We will definitely be coming back. I recommend calling ahead for pick up. It&apos;s small in there ( during covid!) and not much room to wait.","As I walk down Stone Way to head towards Gas Works park, the smell of meat fills the air. I glide towards Stone Way Cafe, as it appears to be the destination where the smell is coming from. I order a coffee so that I can hang out there a little longer and get to the bottom of what this delicious waft of meat may be. 

It turns out that the cooks had just thrown a container the size of a Home Depot water bucket of sausage on the grill. &quot;What is the sausage for?&quot; I asked the staff, like some kind of Fremont rookie. They replied, &quot;Oh you haven&apos;t heard of our breakfast burrito before? It&apos;s really the latest in burrito-technology. The first of its kind. No other coffee house has a burrito like it, truly a must-try.&quot;   After mulling over my options, I decided that I couldn&apos;t pass up this opportunity. After all, it was only a matter of time before bears rolled in and took the place over with the amount of sausage juice filling the air. 

I took this puppy home and busted it wide open. I could immediately tell that Stone Way Cafe wasn&apos;t playing around. This burrito had clearly been grilled, which is a very nice touch. It adds a great texture, and gives the cheese on the inside the ideal melt. I can&apos;t quite put my finger on what sort of sauce they used here, but it&apos;s almost like some sort of spicy queso-type concoction. This thing is a monster, and is bound to leave you completely full. I highly recommend it, and there&apos;s definitely a reason why there is always a line outside. The coffee here is really good, but the burrito is the truth. Let the people know.","If you haven&apos;t been, go. Just go. Now. Get off your couch and go. Best place in Seattle. They&apos;re breakfast burritos are BOMB and they have some of the best coffee in Seattle. My favorite little weekend spot!","What a cute, industrial little spot! I stopped in here with a colleague for a breakfast meeting. Located write on Stone Ave (surprised?), they have a small outdoor seating area and a large indoor space with plenty of socially-distant seating. Parking can be a little tricky in this area, so be prepared to walk a bit.

I ordered the breakfast burrito, which is made with scrambled eggs, homefries, cheddar cheese, pico de gallo, chipotle lime sauce, and your choice of bacon/ham/sausage/pulled pork/chorizo/vegetable of the day. WOW was it delicious. I&apos;ll certainly come back here for the food alone. 

Ding to their 5 stars was that I arrived at 8 (about an hour after they open) and several of the main ingredients they offer in the burrito weren&apos;t ready (vegetables and homefries). I was hungry, so I still ordered, but they could use a bit more planning here. 

I also ordered a latte which was very good!","Best run kitchen in Seattle. Best burrito I&apos;ve had in Seattle and maybe ever?? Stone way is a well oiled machine that deserves your money. They are friendly, fast, and offer a good amount of variety to keep it interesting - even tho I always go for the breakfast burrito.",I love this place and come often but for the prices I would ask that the owner please clean it up. It&apos;s gross not charming. I am considering not coming here anymore despite the nice staff and good food. Part of the experience is esthetics.,"Get. The. Breakfast. Burrito!!!! 

If I could give SWC a million stars, I would. I live right nearby, and have had my life forever changed by their breakfast burritos. Seriously, I go here at least once a week to get one.

There&apos;s always a line out the door on the weekends, but they&apos;re fairly quick in getting them out to you. You definitely can&apos;t go wrong with the veggie burrito, or any of the meats. The chorizo isn&apos;t my absolute favorite of all the meat options - it&apos;s a little cinnamon-y to me - but everything else is delicious. My go to is normally the bacon or sausage, and it&apos;s stuffed to the brim with eggs and home fries and delicious goodness. Ask for a side of their crema to go!","Should&apos;ve come here earlier!! Tasty brunch/breakfast with fresh ingredients with unique takes - portions are generous, super reasonable pricing. Absolutely love their Bisocho and breakfast sandwiches.

Rosalio&apos;s Bisocho - might be my favorite biscuit sandwich ever! Flavorful and savory without being a grease bomb.
Your choice of bacon, ham, sausage, pulled pork, or chorizo, with egg, avocado, tomato, mango aioli, and mixed greens, served on a fluffy, fresh cheddar and jalapeno biscuit. Served with home fries. Would recommend bacon, not sausage as the sausage is sausage crumbles (not patty), which gets a bit messy


Breakfast Sandwich - a less aggressive version of the Bisocho, but a best-in-class breakfast sammie in its own right. Your choice of protein (thick-cut bacon duh), egg, mixed greens, savory herb tomato sauce, cheddar, served on a pillowy potato bun. Also comes with home fries.

Kale Quesadilla was a flavor bomb! Made with kale, chock-full of fried artichoke, cheddar, dressed with chipotle lime sauce, pickled red peppers, green onions, served with a side salad. A bit heavy with the fried artichoke but definitely a snack worth sharing.

Fried Chicken and Waffles - am usually a sucker for chicken and waffle but this was sadly disappointing - nothing sadder than dry chicken. Made me miss Witness&apos; fried chicken and waffle something awful.

Friendly staff, call ahead for tasty takeout!","Wide open seating sufficient for social distancing. Really good coffee though a tad overpriced.
I had the iced mocha with oat milk. 
They also have some nice local beer options",Great and convenient neighborhood spot to grab carryout. Great vibes for a coffee with a friend during times when COVID is not an issue (wishful thinking for the future),I haven&apos;t been since covid but I went today to show my boyfriend how great the food is... despite all the things happening in the industry.. the food is still exactly the same in the sense that it will not disappoint! Thank you so much for being open,"Awesome place to grab some tasty breakfast and Brunch!
If you have a hard time making a decision, sit and watch some of the orders come out of the kitchen and up for order... and then your decision will be even harder!

Everything that was getting slung out by this kitchen staff looked insanely good. We went on a Sunday morning, so yes, it was busy and the wait was relative, but it was still reasonable wait time and exceptionally well priced!

The breakfast burrito definitely appears to be their noteworthy dish, as they were coming out left and right. I had to order it and was not disappointed! It comes fully loaded with eggs, veggies, your choice of meat and some insanely good breakfast potatoes (which we also ordered a side of).

It all tasted great, and made me want to come back and try some more items like their breakfast sandwiches or some of the specials! Would recommend to anyone looking for a brunch bite and needing to avoid the traditional sit down and waitstaff variety on the weekend!
If this is your fist time going, try the burrito with chorizo and a healthy helping of potatoes and valentina hot sauce!

The staff was very friendly when we ordered. They were efficient and getting everyone through the line and when you order coffee or espresso drinks, they come out promptly!

Definitely will be going back! Cheers","This place is sooo good! Was looking for a place that was open (safely) during COVID time that I could work on my computer. Great WiFi, abundant socially-distant seating indoors and outdoors, many charging outlets, and freaking stupendous vegan tacos. Super hyped on Stone Way Cafe","Located right next to Greenlake so you can walk around the lake and head to happy hour which starts are 3pm. 

I came here for the said happy hour and ordered everything off the hh menu. I got to try the clam chowder, calamari strips, crab cakes, and blood orange margarita. Everything was delicious. The crab cakes were my favorite! They did not cheap out on the crab and didn&apos;t add too much seasoning to it so you can really taste the crab! They also give you a side of tasty avocado salad on the side. 

COVID measures: they have outdoor seating and heater lamps around the patio to keep you warm and QR code to read the menus.",We move been to Dukes before and enjoyed it and did to go tonight for the first time since covid began. We split the &quot;tureen&quot; of soup which came with sourdough. They were great with running the order out to us and very friendly when we called and as always the chowder was great. My only thing is $28 for 18oz of soup - eek!,"My husband and I ordered our first meal kit from Duke&apos;s (Hearty Appetizers).  It was beautifully packaged, with very clear (and simple) instructions.  With very little effort, we had a fabulous meal and we were really pleased.  The Hearty Appetizers meal kit was an ample dinner for the two of us.  We also appreciated the no-contact curbside pickup, which was fast and easy.  Kudos to Duke&apos;s!",Food was great. Server was great. They give delicious sour dough bread as a starter. Waiter recommended the salmon bites. Chowder was very chunky full of flavor. Entree dishes were all wonderful.,"Complimentary sourdough bread,
Chowder was FANTASTIC,
Also got the dungress crab,
My tastebuds were ecstatic!

Covered, heated, outdoor seating,
With a lake view to boot.
No doubt you should eat here,
it&apos;s an absolute!","I don&apos;t get it... location?  It&apos;s ok but nothing fantastic except the prices.  I mean $25 for two cod tacos?  We ordered several appetizers.  In addition to a crab stuffed halibut @ $40?  I expected a huge hunk of crab in that halibut but no, the crab raced thru when it saw the future- but the sauces were tasty and the drinks good.  The food was fine but I&apos;m not raving to return.  Guess I&apos;m spoiled.  I give several stars to the cheery staff who knew the menu well.
Thank you.",The service was perfect although the prices are a little over the top but not that much the fish was really salty and sour tho,"Duke&apos;s is a popular Seattle Seafood restaurant. Their famous clam chowder won the Seattle Chowder Cook-Off three years in a row! So we had to try that. Their fish is wild and sustainable vs farmer. That&apos;s a plus!

The menu is like a book. Lots of seafood choices but also options for non-seafood fans. There are 5 delicious chowders (one is vegan) to choose from. Lots of cocktails! The kids menu has a few seafood options and a burger. They also get a 2 oz sampler of chowder too. 

The service was good. The food came out timely. 

I ordered the three course meal. So much food! I could&apos;ve shared. I got the North by Northwest Chowder (all fish, bouillabaisse style), a mixed green salad with pecans and citrus segments, and the fish and chips plate. My husband got the classic clam chowder and prawns and crab gnocchi. 

Overall the food was good. I was expecting something spectacular but it was decent. I&apos;d come back again.",Just brought home the stuffed salmon meal kit. It was excellent. Delicious and easy to prepare. I also thought it was fairly priced. Good portions at reasonable prices. Kudos to Dukes for offering this during the pandemic.,Came here after our 6 mile run at the park across the street. We supposed to go to a Vegan place but it was so crowded. It was a good decision we went to Duke&apos;s . Food is satisfying!,"Had lunch yesterday, during covid. The service was terrific, and &quot;the sailor boy cod taco&quot; was sooooo good!!! It seems pricey at $18, but the quality &amp; portion size of the taco was HUGE. 1 was enough to fill me up.","The food was just okay and expensive, but the service is impeccable.
We went for lunch, a party of four, and we ordered:

- Award Winning New England Clam Chowder ($16.90 for a large bowl, 12 oz) - I wouldn&apos;t say this is the best chowder because certainly the one served at Pike&apos;s Place is much more delicious at half the price. The Duke&apos;s version of Clam Chowder is salty and has less meat. If you want your soup on a sourdough, you need to pay $2.90 extra. So we just ordered the soup on a regular plate and asked for an extra sourdough bread for the table. 

- Unchopped Seafood Salad ($22.90) - chopped salad with Scallop and Shrimp. The dressing itself needs more flavor, but the seafood is very fresh and tasty. 

- Wild Alaskan Salmon with Fresh Blackberry and Polenta ($32.90) - our least favorite on table. Honestly this is a weird combination of ingredients, in a bad way. Everything was literally tasteless. The salmon was dry and bland. The raspberry sauce taste more like dessert. 

- Halibut Entree stuffed with Crab Meat and Prawns ($35.90) - the most flavorful item on the table. The Halibut was fresh, the stuffing was delicious, the roasted potato was crispy and delicious. 

Each table was given a warm sourdough bread and butter. The dough was very sour, which is how I like it. My nephew said the bread is his most favorite thing on the table. 

All in all, I&apos;ve had better seafood elsewhere. With the premium price that this place charges, I expected to get something more delicious.

PS: Duke&apos;s at this location provides a parking space at the back of the restaurant.",Everything was amazing! Expensive but amazing! The mai tai was so strong I was tipsy half way thru it. The blackberry salmon was to die for and every side with it was amazing! The lobster chowder is a must and the original was pretty good too! The sourdough bread was good.,"I came here years ago and it wasn&apos;t very memorable at the time.  I ordered take-out more recently and just want to write a review to remind myself not to order from here.  It&apos;s not bad, which is why I&apos;m giving it a 3 star rating.  

The problem is is the price is extremely high for what you&apos;re getting.  It&apos;s a nice place but not fine dining so I was just really surprised at how little food there is for the price.  

The chowder was $17 for a 12 oz bowl.  with tax and tip that&apos;s $20.50 for a bowl of soup!  I included the utensil for scale so you can see.  I got the award winning clam chowder.  It&apos;s not even that great. The plastic container of Clam Chowder at Trader Joe&apos;s that costs about $4 tastes better than this.  

The salad was about $14.50 for that tiny box.  

The other items we got were some shrimp and salmon dishes.  

Anyway, just wanted to give others a heads up about it.","I had heard about Duke&apos;s for a while and wasn&apos;t really all that thrilled to come here. Walked by many times at Greenlake and saw people on the outdoor deck part and assumed it was more of a drinking place. I was really surprised at how good the seafood here was. 
Was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately. I chose the inside part of the restaurant, as it is pretty cold outside. The inside is decorated nautically and seemed more casual than the deck. The service here is good. The waiter brought me fresh bread, explained the menu and made suggestions.  I had Prawns Cabo Waco to start, with a Duke&apos;s Woodford Reserve Manhattan. The Manhattan was really good, a unique take on this drink. I really love seafood, so this was so hard to chose what to eat. I loved the prawns, they were grilled and had a smoky flavor to them. They come with a avocado salad and citrus vinaigrette. A great combination of flavors. Also tried the crabby deviled egg, which combined both the crab and deviled egg flavors in a tangy bite. Almost full by now, but had the pan roasted salmon. This came with a  ginger and basil crust, topped with a balsamic and Grand Mariner  beurre blanc. 
The seafood quality was great and best of all, they cooked it well. So easy to overcook seafood and I thought they did an outstanding job. There were so many seafood items I wanted to try. They had a nice variety of seafood salads, with salmon, shrimp, crab, blackened salmon. Their crab selection of dishes is generous, most places only offer one choice. Impressive amount of wine, alcoholic and non- alcoholic drinks. 
I would recommend coming here if you enjoy seafood. I think this is one of the  better seafood restaurants, in terms of dishes, quality and variety.","This is for Duke&apos;s on Green Lake. They claim to have award winning chowder and I would absolutely give it an award. The classic clam chowder might be the best chowder I&apos;ve ever had; I certainly can&apos;t think of any better. I also tried the lobster pernod chowder, which is very interesting. It&apos;s a flavor profile I can&apos;t say that I&apos;ve ever had before, but it is quite delicious (not enough to make me get it over the clam, though). 

My wife got the salmon blackberries and I got the dungeness crab salad. Everything tasted exceptionally clean and fresh. The salmon was cooked well and the sauced blackberries were an unexpected but highly successful compliment. The crab salad arrived with about a third to a half more crab than I expected - a highly welcome surprise. The crab itself was perhaps a touch bland, but still tasty and great.

Service was friendly, attentive, and the food arrived in good time. It&apos;s a little more than I expected to pay, however for the quality of the seafood, I&apos;d say it was appropriate, and we feel like we got a good return for our money. We&apos;re only in Seattle for a few days, but we&apos;ve already eaten here 3 times.",The mango chutney in the rock fish tacos was so good!!!! The waiters were all super nice and preppy and the bread that they brought out to start was super warm!,"Tried it for the first time today.  Ordered it as lunch delivery.  The food was tasty, fresh and packaged nicely.  Nonetheless, there&apos;s no justification for the &quot;NYC Times Square during theater hours&quot; restaurant prices.  It&apos;s not as if this is Gordon Ramsay&apos;s restaurant.  So...I tried it, I liked it, but could not find ONE reason to justify the high prices.  I&apos;ll leave that up to the 1% who can afford this on a regular basis.","We have had amazing service and fantastic food consistently from Dukes in Greenlake.   We aren&apos;t foodies, all we ask for is good food and good environment. The fact that Dukes consistently delivers both with the best service you could ask for makes Duke&apos;s a consistent winner for us. Thank you","Food as usual is fantastic. Not a complaint. 

Service?? Iffy as is the norm in Seattle. Saw server when dropping plates. Didn&apos;t pick up finished plates nor offer anything till the bill was dropped.",This place is amazing. I had gone here a handful of times for pick up order(obviously) and everything they have is great. The portion is good enough to keep you full and the flavor is amazing. You can&apos;t go wrong here. I highly recommend this place for a takeout.,"I don&apos;t know why it took me so long to check out Lula, but I&apos;m SO glad I finally did!

I was running short on time between meetings so I decided to place an online order through Lula&apos;s website. The online system is very straightforward which was great, and goodness - $8.50 for such a generously portioned salad? Nice!

They were friendly when I picked up the salad and I was able to have a very tasty salad during a jam-packed day which was great. I ordered the Harvest salad and the toasted buckwheat added such a nice crunch! The ingredients including grape (who knew) and roasted brussel sprout all came together so nicely. The amount of dressing was just right - not too much and not too little.

I will 1000% be back!","The ingredients are fresh and tasty, the portion sizes are generous, and the salads are cheap. I sampled the seasonal with squash and spicy pepitas and it was awesome! Will be back soon.","It was fun hearing my wife try to break down the flavor profiles of the Ensalada Salad. There was a flavor that she couldn&apos;t quite figure out, but really liked. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s an ingredient in the mojo rojo dressing that she was tasting as I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a lot that goes into making that dressing in house. 

We shared the Lula Salad and the Ensalada Salad. She liked the Lula but there was that one flavor in the Ensalada that she really, really liked.

When I first started eating the salad I thought that I could have gone for a salad that was twice as big but by the time I was finished I was plenty full. The fact that it&apos;s a chopped salad makes the ingredients more packed together than your typical un-chopped salad. Every bite was flavorful and satisfying. 

We will definitely be going back. The Lula and Ensalada were both really good!","First of all, my husband was a big fan when he introduced lula salad to me. And he was right, it was and is still the best salad I&apos;ve ever eaten. The Lula salad with chicken and bacon bits, are extremely moist, tasty and the sauce was evenly distributed, not to mention their generous portion. I can eat it everyday of the week and still crave on weekends. Thank you!!","Getting a great salad for under $10 in Downtown Seattle is no easy feat, but Lula serves delicious *chopped* salads that are a wonderful meal! There are four salad options -- I got the one with avocado, bacon, cherry tomatoes, and cranberries. 

Salads often leave me craving for more but this one was a full meal. I&apos;ll definitely be coming back next time I see their food truck!","GIMMMMMME ALL THE GREENS, Lula just take my debit card info already.. (cash free establishment) haha but wow! Ok.. healthy!!! Honestly, I&apos;m a fan of this place.. I feel like salad places are growing but Lula is fire!!!! So good! 

OK. I&apos;ve had their Mediterranean, Caesar (+chicken), Lula salads. 
What got me though is their tofu.. like stop right now!!!! It&apos;s prepared just how I like it.. hard. But really, it&apos;s cubed perfectly, it&apos;s firm, it&apos;s my favorite add-on. 

But anyway... happy with their portions. If only they sold their salad dressings--like sign me up!","Found this gem from a seattle food truck website and came here with a friend for lunch in SLU. I do have to say their salads are damn good and super fresh, but the wait was absurdly long. It might be worth it to some to wait, but sometimes I don&apos;t have the patience, even if the salads are really great.","I&apos;m a fan and I WILL be back. Kelly broke down every salad&apos;s flavor profile and helped me decide on ordering the most popular Lula salad. It&apos;s got dried cranberries, bacon bits, avocado, and a maple vinaigrette - sweet and salty perfection.

I actually had evergreens yesterday and I think what gives Lula an extra star is how the salad is flavorful without being coated in dressing. They&apos;re in downtown 3 times a week, on 2nd and Marion every Friday.

Trying the Kale Caesar next time!","I love Lula Salads. It took me a long time to try it even though I live just around the corner because I am not that fond of salads, but Lula has completely changed that for me. The owner is super nice, the ingredients are always fresh, and the dressings are all great. I come here often and will continue to be my go to place - it&apos;s fast yet super healthy.","First time at Lula Salads and I ordered the Lula salad (hey, it&apos;s their signature salad so I figured I&apos;d start there). First off, I love a chopped salad. All the ingredients are evenly distributed and coated in their tasty dressing. 
Generously portioned, the Lula was a perfect combination of savory with just the right amount of sweetness. I opted to add tofu: PERFECTION! Their tofu is in small-ish cubes, VERY firm, and seasoned appropriately. 
Olivia was SO kind and helpful with a great attitude.
I will definitely be adding Lula Salads to my meal rotation! 
(BTW-The Andes chocolate mint taped to the box is a great touch)","Lula Salads is the best salad spot in downtown Seattle. Believe me, I&apos;ve tried &apos;em all; I work downtown and eat out five days a week. Better than Evergreens, Sprout, Walla Walla Farms, etc. etc. I legit eat here three days a week and just rotate between the Lula and the Harvest. 

I&apos;m not sure why this is so much better than the rest, but every person I take here becomes a regular. I don&apos;t care too much about service quality (I rate based on food, not people), but for those that do, the employees are super friendly.","As a salad lover who has eaten quite a few amazing salads in my lifetime, let me tell you, Lula&apos;s are the best salads I have ever eaten. We tried the Ensalada, the Lula and Harvest. Each so different and yet so amazing. They even swapped the bacon for tofu at no extra charge. Very generous portions to make a meal. Please try it and support this small business so we don&apos;t have to pay 15+ $ for a poor excuse of a salad at fancy restaurants",Great food excellent customer service definitely give them a tip!! The Lula and avocado toast is my favorite CombWambo,"it&apos;s a sunny summer day in seattle: i&apos;ve walked around greenlake twice and am craving a salad.
i turn to yelp and decide to take a chance on a place i&apos;ve never heard of (to be fair, i don&apos;t live in the north end but i&apos;m willing to give it a go.)

lula was sheer perfection!
from the choices of salads to the minimalistic decor, to the recyclable bamboo utensil and the super delicious seasonal salad i had!

there was literally nothing i would mark them
down for! i was told they didn&apos;t have any red cabbage so he subbed zucchini
which was fine by me and didn&apos;t lessen the caliber of the salad by any means. i opted to add marinated/baked tofu which was also delicious!

the portion was the perfect amount for
how hungry i was and every bite was a flavor explosion because all the ingredients of
whichever salad you order are chopped up so that they&apos;re equally distributed.

i seriously loved my salad. ingredients were fresh and i&apos;d say when you&apos;re jonesing a bowl of good
for you veggies and protein, this place should be in your head and your heavy rotation. it&apos;s now in mine!","My favorite salad place! Such a great price (~$10) for the amount of food. Their house name salad is by far my favorite salad EVER. All the ingredients are freshly made, well mixed, and with the size, you&apos;re guaranteed to be full after one. Coming from someone who doesn&apos;t care for avocados that much, I don&apos;t know how or where they grow their magical avocados. They&apos;re always so creamy and tasty. Their tomatoes are juicy and sweet and their housemade croutons are extra crunchy. Lula also carries a variety of delicious proteins including marinated tofu and perfectly cooked medium rare steak. I also add roasted brussel sprouts to mine which are drool worthy. I used to live 2 minutes from the storefront and would go there at least once a week. The owner is super nice and always remembers our recurring orders. Not sure if it&apos;s more a testament to his memory or evidence that we go there way too much. 

The store does not have any seating, so it&apos;s great for people who live nearby and can just take it home.

If you ever see a green food truck, look to see if it&apos;s Lula, and get yourself a salad!","Honestly I was a bit skeptical of a salad food truck, I mean how much better can it be? A lot better is the answer and I was delightfully surprised how well made this salad was.

I got the Ensalada with chicken for around $10 and it was fantastic. Filling, flavorful and still felt healthy which is rare for a salad this tasty.

Definitely will be back and eating these salads again soon.","One of the best salads I&apos;ve ever had. The salads were just fresh and tasteful, I cannot say enough about this place!!!","Always fresh salads and friendly service and customizations. The tofu actually tastes pretty good. All their salads are well thought out and balanced with texture, crunch, and interesting dressings. Pricing is reasonable too.",Omg this place is so tasty. Such a need to have more healthy grab and go options. Wish there were more places like Lula!,"WOW! No wonder this place is so highly reviewed! I had been meaning to try it forever and finally saw a great Groupon deal that got me in the door. The restaurant itself is adorable but only has a few outdoor uncovered tables for dining so I definitely recommend getting takeout until the sun comes out or we hit the next phase of dining. 

The menu is short, sweet, and accessible. As a gluten-free pescatarian, it was easy for me to see what I could eat, how they could accommodate the different dishes, etc. It had a lot of variety without being overwhelming. If you have any food allergies, this is your spot. The staff was knowledgeable in helping me find something that fits my needs and the menu itself has so many options and substitutions. 

I landed on the West Caribbean Bowl with tofu. I was BLOWN AWAY by the incredible flavor and texture. Especially for the price! It is VERY reasonable and the food will blow you away. I am already looking forward to going back and telling all my friends they have to try it. The chips were phenomenal, the tostones were a wonderful side and scooper for my bowl, and I seriously could not get myself to stop eating it even after I was full because the flavor was just that good. This is a MUST in Seattle!","Delicious sandwhich and nachos!!!
Caribbean sandwhich was big. The meat was moist. Nachos with roasted beef was my favorite. The portion was big for $6. Everything together were a great combination. Service was fast and friendly. No dine in, call to pre-order and pick up.","Drove into Fremont and walked up to Paseo to order lunch sandwiches back in December. They have blocked off most of the store interior for COVID safety, so we placed our order right inside the front door, waited briefly outside for our food, and drove home to eat.

If I remember correctly, we ordered the Famous Caribbean Roast sandwich, the Paseo Press sandwich, and Caribbean fries. Everything tasted mouthwateringly delicious. The bread was fresh and not crumbly, the pork was juicy, and the fries were hot and well-seasoned (the garlic aioli dip was the icing on the cake). Servings were very generous; we were stuffed afterwards. Absolutely worth the price and will definitely be back to Paseo the next time I am in Seattle.","I lived in Seattle for almost 2 years before I tried this place. I had some friends visiting and we looked at the menu and saw the Caribbean roast pork sandwich was advertised as the best sandwich in America! We laughed a skeptical laugh but ordered it anyways. Joke was on us, turns out it is the best sandwich in America! Disclaimer: food enhancing substances may have been involved.

I like the other sandwiches too, but just not as much as the Caribbean. I do occasionally get the platter instead of the sandwich though to mix it up. I wish the salad that came with the platter had dressing on it, but it&apos;s still good.

Edit: I forgot to mention these sandwiches are super reasonably priced.","Tip: do your Yelp check-in BEFORE you pay for your order. There&apos;s a coupon for a free cafe cubano. I found it right after I paid for my order, promptly showed it to the man at the register, but he said I was too late. Perhaps someone didn&apos;t want to make me a coffee? Hmmm...

I wish I could say the food was as bad as the service. But, it wasn&apos;t. It was effing amazing. Heavy on the greasy side, but good! 

With a cubano, it would have been damn good. 

2 stars for service. 5 stars for the food.","Heard tons of great things about this place and I was really craving a bomb sandwich. I got there early when they first opened. Looking at the menu I opted for the pork shoulder(best in the area) and the chicken strip sandwich. They all sounded really good so I thought I&apos;d give both a try. The pork shoulder was claimed to be the best in America so I had to see for myself, I also really like chicken sandwiches more than beef. 
Got my order fairly quick. The chicken one was more on the dry side but the pork one was delicious! It W&apos;s juicy and u could taste all the flavoring. Messy but bomb! 
Little bit on the pricey side but overall worth it. I would definitely come back for the pork sandwich.","I mean, for a buy one get one free deal, this was a steal. The churros were delicious on their own, and I would say that they were even better eaten without the dipping sauce. The rice bowl was also great, with the meat being super tender and flavorful. There was just enough in the bowl to keep every bite exciting and flavorful. Overall, loved everything about this place!","Ordered the Caribbean Roast sandwich. Being from the south, the pork struck me as a very well-executed version of pulled pork. It was sweet, tender, but a bit one-note. 

The sandwich bun had a wonderful shiny, crusty exterior and was perfect with the sauce. IMO the onions should be shaved, not large slabs - also they weren&apos;t particularly flavorful. I was hoping the onions would lend a more caramelized flavor. 

Finally, there really should have been more cilantro or some herb to spice it up. That said, this was still a good sandwich. Just not as good as I was expecting. The service was great though.","My friend and I stopped by Paseo for dinner before our outdoor concert at Gasworks Park. We were intrigued by the #1 on the menu since it was rated &quot;The Best Sandwich in America.&quot; Paseo made it to Esquire&apos;s Best Sandwiches in America list and we were sold. We had to try it! 

The #1 on their menu is their Famous Caribbean Roast. It consists of marinated &amp; slow roasted pork shoulder, cilantro, pickled jalapenos, caramelized onions &amp; crisp romaine served on a toasted baguette. 

Ooof. The sandwich was fire! I recommend eating it one sitting or splitting the sandwich with someone while it&apos;s still hot from the shop. I don&apos;t recommend saving it for leftovers as it doesn&apos;t sit well. The bread will get soggy from juices from the meat and veggies. 

I&apos;ll be back to try the Sauteed Prawns sandwich!",Fantastic sando! These things are HUGE! We got the Caribbean Roast and the Paseo Press. Both were great - pork was super juicy and flavorful. Banana peppers and the cilantro added some great flavors. Would definitely go back again.,"Oh. My. Gosh. Everything we ate was delicious! We ordered the Caribbean Pork, the Havana Seared Scallops, and the Cuban Roast. Loved all of the sides and sauces and the staff was friendly and super COVID safe as well. They&apos;re open late and on my way home from work, so I&apos;ll be a frequent flyer for sure","Of course had to try out the famous Caribbean Pork. The portion size matches the price. There&apos;s a hefty amount of meat and it&apos;s juicy but too greasy for my taste. The wrapping paper is soaked in oil from the start. It&apos;s literally too vertically gifted to fit a whole bite in my mouth. It&apos;s inevitable that the meat is gonna be squeezed out and grease is gonna drip everywhere even if you try to eat carefully. The bread is honestly my favorite part as it is warm and crunchy. It certainly is not bad when you&apos;re in the mood for some carby fatty comfort food but it&apos;s kinda overhyped imo. 

Masks are required inside. There are wooden benches outside under shady trees but most people took it to-go. Gotta find street parking.","the first time i went to seattle, this was on my list. sadly, i didn&apos;t make time for it! but on my second visit, i knew i had to squeeze it in my long list of food to eat! i am so glad i made room for this place. because now i need to go here during seattle visits. their sandwiches are SOOO good.

i def had to try their #1famous carribean roast, underneath this, it says &quot;rated best sandwich in america.&quot; it&apos;s marinated pork shoulder, with pickled jalapenos and caramelized onions. this sandwich was amazing!! it was messy, super worth it with all that meat juice. it def had a kick to it, but i should have asked for extra jalapenos. caramelized onions was really goood! the bread was good but it was def a lot of bread. im not complaining, i love bread!! would totally get this again.

i also tried their seared scallop sandwich. from other reviews, it seemed like they don&apos;t serve this everyday and it does sell out. so i def had to try this bc i love scallops! for me, this is spicier than carribean roast sandwich. it was def really good too but wish it had more scallops. it was really flavorful! 

i cant wait to go back and get more sandwiches!","Being a native Seattleite, I have always heard of Paseo and how it&apos;s the BEST cuban sandwich in the city. I had high expectations and wow... Paseo exceeded them!! Ordering online was simple and easy on their website, my food was ready in 10-15 minutes. The store was clean and followed distancing guidelines. I noticed a couple benches/tables outside for people to eat at. Street parking was okay at 2pm on a weekday, there are quite a few food pickup load/unload spots on the street.

I ordered the #1 &quot;the best sandwich ever&quot; and it was so JUICY and flavorful. The lettuce and pickled jalape√±os really elevated the flavor and the bread was able to take on all the juiciness from the pork!! I surprisingly finished the whole thing (it is huge) and I was full for the rest of the day. My partner ordered the Paseo Jambalaya with 5 stars and it was so flavorful! 5 stars was a bit challenging for me to eat, I personally prefer a spice level around 3 stars but the spiciness doesn&apos;t overpower the flavor of the dish. I am definitely going to return and try some new things. Paseo is amazing and I highly recommend it. The price is great and affordable for the quality and expertise of food you receive!",Very good sandwich. Juicy sweet tasty lip smacking goodness.The bread holds up to all the juiciness. ¬†Literally some of the best sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had.,"The sandwich is soooo juicy and so lovely 
Their service is super good
Their pork shoulder flavor is soooo fulfilling 
I love it sooooo much","I&apos;ve been reading its reviews and everyone was saying a lot about its sandwich. 
As I am a sandwich lover so I planed to try it, and see how good is its sandwich, it come to be an amazing sandwich! This place is famous for a reason! The #1 sandwich was delicious at a decent price.
So yah its real, one of the best sandwiches I&apos;ve tried so far.","Delicious Cuban sandwiches! My husband and I got the Caribbean Roast and we both loved it! The pulled pork, caramelized onions and jalapenos are so fresh and well cooked that they melt in your mouth!

What&apos;s special about the Fremont location is their plantine chips and salsa to die for! Best plantine chips I&apos;ve had in my life!

If you visit the beautiful Fremont area, take a walk to paseo and enjoy a sandwich+chips &amp; salsa! Bon appetit!","I&apos;ve heard so much about Paseo from all my friends and even people visiting Seattle that I figured it was time for me to try it. Let me say for my sandwich I was not disappointed.

Caribbean Roast Sandwich: Ordered their classic (and I think most well known?) sandwich. Tons of meat, super delicious and so filling I could only eat half. I loved the sauce, the veggies in it and overall was a great sandwich.

Tofu Sandwich: this is where I&apos;m docking a star. My friend is vegetarian and decided to order this sandwich and didn&apos;t expect to see any meat in there. When we sat down she saw bits of meat on the top and ends of her sandwich and I ended up taking them off and putting them on my own. I definitely understand it&apos;s hard when most of the sandwiches predominantly have meat in them, but I think this is something that restaurants should be mindful of if they are offering a vegetarian option.

Anyway, overall I think we were still both pretty happy with our food and because it&apos;s only takeout right now, we went to a small park nearby and had a mini picnic in the shade which was a great move!","Phenomenal sandwiches-- I can tell why this place is so busy! It was recommended to us by a local and it did not disappoint. The churros (on the &quot;hidden menu&quot;) were an absolutely delicious but a little too sweet for my taste. I didn&apos;t expect to have an entire pack of them! 

The only downside is that their bathrooms were not up to COVID safety standards and I really don&apos;t recommend using them. The outdoor benches also had signs that they are not sanitized regularly and were &quot;off limits&quot;.. AKA they don&apos;t take responsibility if you get sick from them, but leave them outside for customers anyway.","Well this is allegedly THE PLACE for splurging dining hall money at the end of the quarter. Came here during lunch hours and the price point was surprisingly pretty average for an American style restaurant. It&apos;s also not too bad considering how HFS overcharges other regular dining hall food. 

I got the steak and eggs and it looked really appetizing. The steak was a tiny bit too greasy but it was actually well-marinated and juicy. However it wasn&apos;t tender enough and I couldn&apos;t chew down all of it. The potatoes, eggs, and toast were fairly standard. Overall the plate had a nice variety and this was definitely worth getting. 

Water is self-served, but the glasses had grease stains.","Haddock on the menu...that&apos;s all I need to hear. I&apos;ll probably order the fries without seasoning next time. 
Great place to meet friends for lunch. Service was fast, enjoyed made to order on campus.","Went there so many times in my freshman year to spend my dinning money. To be honest their food is pretty good for most of the time. The food might be pricer than eating out but are still in an acceptable range, and you don&apos;t need to tip for pay for the tax if you are paying through husky card. I heard they also start to have discount for students with dinning plan. 

I was never disappointed by their pasta and I like how they change the menu every quarter and have daily specials so that you can always try something new. I&apos;m surprised about how many times I&apos;ve eaten there until I went through all the photos I took. 

This is a good place to go if you&apos;re tired of the regular dinning places on campus, especially for people who are trying to finish their dinning plan!","Food is definitely the best on campus food you can get. Personally, I am a fan of their french toast. Best french toast I have ever had, and it isn&apos;t that expensive. 

They also have a chef&apos;s special pasta that changes, so ask what it is. The beef ragu was really good, and it comes with amazingly crisp garlic bread. 

If you mistakenly got too much dining money, treat yourself because the rest of campus food will suck your soul away :) (jk it&apos;s not that bad)","BE CAUTIOUS!!! the food is good BUT is a tactic to TRICK you out of your money. For $30, I got GROSS, SKINNY ASS LONG HAIR embedded in the sauce of my steak. I showed a worker and he WAS UNTRAINED AND NO IDEA HOW TO REACT. He said &quot;yikes thats really gross ill um...tell the kitchen&quot; and skkrtted away. BRUH WTFFF u aint even gon take my plate away? The hell u expect me to eat a germy plate of blonde dna?!? Smh. He comes back 10 minutes later &quot;the kitchen sends their apologies heres a cup of fries even tho u already have fries&quot; AND BLASTED OFF SO QUICK I couldnt even respond. No refund, no remade plate, just more fries lmao. I feel like common sense could have saved this man but then again nO ONE in the kitchen wears hairnets. THIS COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING: THEYRE TRYING TO infect us with diseases and using the bomb ass food to finesse us into their trap. NEVER AGAIN CULTIVATE!! caught and exposed. 

Ok but fr, please wear hairnets and learn how to deal with a situation like this. Really not okay lol.","Cultivate was a few blocks away from my old apartment so I went a lot! I love the open and bright space, how clean it is and the servers and host are great! There&apos;s many options for vegetarians (hooray) and everything taste delicious and fresh! I LOVE the onion rings! The price is very budget friendly and portions are filling.","I have been to this place a couple times before so I thought I might as well go ahead and do a review since I just had lunch here a couple hours ago. My cousin and I were looking for some place to eat around campus and this is honestly the first place I thought about when it comes to having good food.

My cousin got the Cultivate Scramble (or something like that... it&apos;s the first thing on the menu) and I got the Salmon Fettuccini. I think I might have had the scramble one before because when we got the food, it looked familiar. My cousin was attracted to the pasta so we literally switched food right then and there. But we shared anyways because that was the plan in the first place.

I definitely enjoyed the scramble. Even though I am not a big fan of peppers, I still ate it because it was all folded in the egg, it wasn&apos;t like I was going to pick out each and every one of those peppers. I have done that before but I was hungry so I didn&apos;t want to spend my time picking them off.

I got to the pasta and OMGGGGG, it was very salty. I was not expecting that. Because my tastebuds are so sensitive, it just felt like I was eating salt in every single bite. I am not trying to be mean but that is what it felt like to me. That was not pleasant. I guess it was a good thing my cousin and I switched dishes because I wouldn&apos;t have been able to finish that had I stuck with that plate of food. I was a little shocked because my cousin said the last time she had that, it was not that salty at all. She was not able to finish it unfortunately. But it&apos;s all good because she was the one who paid anyways. HAHA. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my own food that she ordered.

I would come back here not for the fettuccine, but for something else they have on the menu. I remember last visit we had before this one, they had really good fries and I enjoy anything potato so I would have to come back and get some of their fries again next time I want to eat on campus.","Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 450¬∞F.
Using a heavy knife, mince and mash garlic to a paste with 1/8 teaspoon table salt.
Beat together butter, shallot, garlic paste, parsley, remaining 1/4 teaspoon table salt, and pepper in a small bowl with an electric mixer until combined well. Beat in wine until combined well.
Divide half of garlic butter among snail shells. Stuff 1 snail into each shell and top snails with remaining butter. Spread kosher salt in a shallow baking dish and nestle shells, butter sides up, in salt.
Bake snails until butter is melted and sizzling, 4 to 6 minutes. Serve immediately.","I remember when this place was first established in 2012. I was a freshman in college and was super excited because I would be living in a new dorm with a new restaurant attached to it. My hopes and dreams were crushed when they served me a flank steak, flat and dry, for nearly $20. 

Over the years, they have progressively improved however it still remains to be the try-hard fancy restaurant on campus. HFS tries to be fancy and hipster with their food but they fail everytime. It&apos;s cheaper to buy a rotisserie chicken from sketch-way.","Ordered medium rare steak but it turned out to be well done. Surface was burned -- very bitter. Have been here several times and it&apos;s always like this. So disappointing. I feel sad for the cow. 
Zero star for the food. One star for the service. Waitress was pretty friendly. No tax if you pay by husky card.. still, I&apos;d rather go to the dm to spend my dining balance.",And now it&apos;s burnt. Is it really that hard to make medium steak? At the very least it should be edible.,"Good place to goÔºÅ
U can have discounts by using husky card.
Remembet to make reservation cause there are so many prople in rush hours.","Food: only 2 to 3 stars, and I&apos;m not even that picky
Service is a hit or miss but generally great!

The atmosphere and location is amazing! That&apos;s why I give it 4 stars. Cuz a dining experience is not all about food, is it? Plus, as a college guy I enjoy the college energy of this restaurant. It&apos;s a good place for a date during a sunny day.","50/50 experience with staff not very attentive

Pro: On campus, an excellent breadth of menu options, countertop seating optional
Con: Poor customer service, long wait times to get food at tables.

Experience #1: Summary: 
3 Guests
2 Order Friend Chicken Sandwich
1 Cheesecake

Both sandwiches arrived burnt and upon requesting a new chicken was instructed the condition was as-is. After informing the server we would not be returning, the assistant manager assumed responsibility and comped our meal. 

Experience #2: Summary
4 guests
1 Mushroom Philly, 1 Caesar Salad, 1 Cheesecake, 1 Quesadilla. 

Condition of Philly: Hot
Condition of sides (french fries): Lukewarm
Condition of Caesar Salad: warm, not chilled
Condition of Quesadilla: Hot but lacking an ample amount of cheese
Condition of Cheesecake (Cherry): Didn&apos;t show up. 10 minutes and two changes later the cheesecake arrived, making for around.

Overall, this experience solidified my lack of desire to support this place. I value relaxation and good service, and this place provided neither of these. Not coming back, because the service is disorganized and frustrating.","A nice option in the U District.

This is the place I go when someone wants to eat a salad for lunch. The food is so-so but it&apos;s a nicer environment, no tipping (b/c it&apos;s UW dining), and the salads are usually solid. I wish the hot dishes weren&apos;t drench in a sauce or were too sweet b/c they could be better. I do like the tator tots with truffle oil.","Came in for lunch on a Friday, my group ordered:

Poutine
Pastrami sandwich w/ simple greens side salad 
BST sandwich w/ Market wedge side salad
Salmon chowder 
Fish and chips
Seattle dog
(I had the poutine and the pastrami)

Poutine:
Plenty of gooey and stringy cheese curds (my favorite part). Too much gravy for my taste - felt like my fries were swimming in it and got very soggy by the end (especially in the deep skillet). A little salty, but that was fine. Mushroom pieces were present but not particularly noticeable, and it appeared that there were some fancier wild-type mushrooms (thought I saw some chanterelle bits) instead of the standard mushroom gravy.

Simple Green Salad side:
Small and pretty. Cultivate uses produce from the UW farms gardens, looks like the radishes and carrots were from the gardens and very fresh. The sun-dried tomato vinaigrette didn&apos;t taste like much and was not vinegary at all, more like an oil base with minced tomato.

Pastrami sandwich:
A little surprised that the baguette wasn&apos;t more &quot;rustic&quot;, but it was fine and very standard. I did not get the Swiss add on and didn&apos;t miss the cheese (especially after the poutine), but I did really wish that there was something more to just the bread/mustard/meat. Some sauerkraut would&apos;ve been killer. 


Observations and feedback I heard on the other items:

BST sandwich - the bread looked like normal sliced bread, nothing fancy. Maybe they use Dave&apos;s killer bread?

Market salad side - not really worth the $2 upgrade. A tiny little wedge of lettuce, but very pretty with all the flower petals.

Salmon chowder - good, and more filling than expected

Fish and Chips - good, nice blend of spices/flavors in the fish. I tried a fry with tartar and the tartar was pretty creamy. Fries looked like they had some herbs and maybe some light parmesan or minced garlic bits sprinkled on them. 

The Seattle Dog - huge! For $8 seems like a great deal. Came with a little skillet of mac and cheese (penne pasta), which looked very creamy but not stringy if you like that kinda mac. They forgot the cream cheese and brought it out as a side.

Reservations/Wait: Our party of 4 came in just after 12. The hostess said that they were booked with reservations until 12:45pm (there was even a sign taped to their door saying so), but there&apos;d be a 15-20 minute wait otherwise. We opted to wait, but luckily got in within a few minutes due to a cancelled reservation. I would recommend making a reservation during peak times, but there were several empty tables around us the whole time we were there so I suspect people have picked up on the &quot;reservation needed&quot; tip and are just making reservations to hold tables just in case. 

Service was fine, nothing spectacular but all the students/servers were nice enough. Only complaint is it took forever for them to bring the check. 

No tipping which is very nice! Supposedly if you pay with your Husky card account there is also no tax.

Overall I was happy with everything and would come back to try some of the other stuff.","I ordered grilled chicken and simple greens salad, but they gave me cakes! Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","Cultivate is a really cool place to eat on the University of Washington Campus. It is technically a dining hall but it doesn&apos;t feel like it at all! There are always great specials and the regular menu options are also delicious. Best of all, you can use credit cards OR your HuskyCard to pay!

You can  enjoy outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  I recommend making a reservation if you plan to go for lunch as it can get fairly crowded.","I came here to meet up with some friends at the University of Washington. The restaurant is located within the campus and was a convenient lunch spot. There is paid side street parking nearby.

We had made reservations prior and were seated immediately. I ordered the poutine fries with roasted mushroom umami gravy and the pan seared salmon. The poutine fries were delicious. However, the pan seared salmon was dry. Also, the butternut squash was undercooked. The lemon butter, beets, and kale that came with the salmon was savory and tasty. But overall I was disappointed in the dish because the salmon was too try and the squash was undercooked which made it hard to eat.","Also known as Cultivape and Cultidate. If someone takes you on a date here, download tinder and find someone new. 

This is the pit hole of hell on earth. I would rather take a razor scooter to the ankle 42 times than eat their partly reheated sack of plastic. They always run out of food and they are a RESTAURANT so I don&apos;t understand how this is possible. They use to serve good tater tots but now they&apos;re so greasy I couldn&apos;t tell the different between them and an 8th grade boys hair. 

Would not recommend. Just take the 375 and love yourself enough to go to the 8 instead.",I&apos;m so glad Sand Point Grill is operating during COVID-19. They have the best burger in Seattle,"Their meatloaf is amazing, and you really get enough for 2 people. Comes with mashed potatoes and veggies, and was absolutely tender, and tasted delicious. My wife and I shared a takeout order, and we both ordered adult to-go beverages which were amazing! Can&apos;t wait to go back when the Quarantine is lifted, nice family atmosphere, and great neighborhood bar! Highly recommend","Raving about the SAND POINT GRILL! 
The pork chop in sweet marsala sauce was out of this world and I can&apos;t stop thinking about it! My neighbor had the Churrasco steak that was prepared perfectly. We begin with the smoked salmon spread with olive tapenade which would have been worth the trip all on its own, followed by Caesar salads that would rival the most authentic of italian restaurants! Mine was a BBT (added bacon, Beecher&apos;s cheddar and tomato), and now I&apos;m afraid I can never go back to a plain old Caesar again. The cr√®me br√ªl√©e, my favorite dessert, was probably one of the best I&apos;ve ever had. This little restaurant goes above and beyond in the quality food department, and their service was equally outstanding. Topped off with great cocktails and Seattle-trivia artwork that had us skipping down memory lane, it&apos;s safe to say I can&apos;t wait to go back!","Sand Point Grill serves the absolute best burger in town. And their fries are also incredibly delicious. Really hit the spot last night. Thank you, SPG!","Yum! A neighbor had recommended this restaurant to me a couple of years ago and I kind of forgot about it. Thankfully I remembered and was able to try it out this week! I got here just after 5pm before the dinner rush and tried their Stoup porter (amazing!) as well as the soup of the day (a bunch of veggies pureed with a sort of curry apple flavor and a drizzle of truffle oil. I was nice and satiated by the time my friend arrived to join me. We shared the bruschetta (unique take on this traditional appetizer!) I loved the pomegranate and goat cheese. We also shared the quicos (large corn nuts) dish and enjoyed those very much. 

For dinner I had the fish tacos but opted to go without the flour tortillas in favor of greens. It ended up being a nice ahi salad - perfect! I tasted the chicken penne pasta dish my friend ordered and it was delightful as well.

We finished the meal with the gelatiamo ice cream in cookies and cream and almond flavors (comes with molasses cookies baked fresh and delicious!)

Great customer service and lovely dining setting. Looking forward to future visits to this lovely establishment! Parking is available in the City People lot or along Sand Point Way.","Picked up dinner for myself and my daughter, who is a patient at Seattle Children&apos;s. The food was ***delicious***, and they went above and beyond sending a to-go creme br√ªl√©e for a teenager who isn&apos;t allowed to leave the hospital. Thank you!!!","Nice, quiet, and cozy neighborhood restaurant. Perfect for weekend date nights or dinner with friends. We tried them out for dinner and found both the food and service were excellent. Reservations were fairly easy through Open Table. The restaurant is on Sand Point Way and there&apos;s both street and private lot parking available. There was no wait time and we were immediately seated upon arrival. 

The menu looked very promising. We started with a round of cocktails and I ordered the maple walnut old fashioned. We ordered the meat and cheese board for our appetizer. For the entrees, we ordered the cioppino and buttermilk fried chicken. The meat and cheese tray was interesting. There were not a lot of meats or cheeses, however an abundance of quicos (giant fried corn kernels). The cioppino was tasty and had a generous amount of fresh fish. The buttermilk chicken was my favorite. It was fried to perfection and served on top of mashed potatoes with a side of haricot vert. Needless to say both dishes were filling and we forgot to leave room for dessert.

The staff were prompt, personable, and consistently checked in on our meal. I would not hesitate to return to this restaurant.",I&apos;ve been here three times in the past three weeks. Mainly because there were few places around with a decent happy hour nearby. But then I started craving the fries that come with the happy hour burger ($12). Their fries are soooooooo crave-worthy. And the burger has... wait for it... crispy bacon on it! Incredibly nice staff. Mostly went with small groups but once arrived with 9 people and they were more than accommodating. Whoever is the server for the HH section on Saturdays... is a true gem! I had fun with their rotating tap and had some delicious IPAs.,This place is an absolute gem! The staff and food are the best.   Don&apos;t make it by nearly enough.,"comfy, no nonsense, friendly, consistent neighborhood spot","Went here for happy hour and we were very impressed. Their mussels were probably the best mussels we&apos;ve ever had - well cooked, tender, and had great seafood and garlic flavor. We also ate their schnitzel sandwich which was good as well. Nicely cooked and very crispy schnitzel. Price is reasonable and a really cute local restaurant feel that I really appreciate. Service was also on point. I just wish their beer selection was larger. I&apos;ve had the regular menu before and the risotto is super amazing. Definitely a must try.","Change is inevitable. And it has come to the Sand Point Grill under a new owner. The place is still very popular- there are few neighborhood places like it. But now profit, it seems, has become dominant. Drinks are pricier and smaller, not everyone&apos;s concern I realize. Many of the friendly staff remain, but they seem more driven. The restaurant
business is tough, I realize, but I mourn the more relaxed atmosphere, and of course the bargain drink prices.","A small restaurant in a mini-strip mall in Sand Point ... the Caesar salad had a nice bite to it, and the fresh anchovies were great.  The bread was bland (low quality Italian). The service was friendly and fast. If you&apos;re in the neighborhood and need a bite, not bad. Don&apos;t make a special trip though.","The change in ownership at the restaurant has not been good. An entirely new menu and it&apos;s a completely different staff, environment and culture. Food is adequate, and the wait staff was mediocre but the set menus were uninteresting and the push from the wait staff was offensive. Any typical weeknight the restaurant would have been packed with families and friends. Now, barely a third of the restaurant was filled. We won&apos;t be back.","We have never been in person but they are on Postmates and we have ordered them a bunch and the food is tasty. Unfortunately they have gotten less and less reliable of a place to order takeout from and our recent order didn&apos;t get placed at all. If you are in person, give it a shot. If you are thinking of ordering from a delivery service expect problems.","This is one of those places that you wish was around the corner from your own house. Great bar, great food, good atmosphere as well as good service from nice people. Go, if you are thinking about it","Food was delicious - we ordered the flank steak, chicken &amp; broccoli pasta, and steak arugula salad. The portions are small but it was fulfilling and we enjoyed the food. The staff are very friendly, and the restaurants itself had a nice mellow vibe.","Why did it take me so long to find this wonderful, casual yet sophisticated neighborhood restaurant? Their thoughtful and honest menu has something great for every occasion while protein features prominently (i.e., good value!) both on the vegetarian, fish and carnivore side of the equation if I&apos;m saying that correctly. I can&apos;t decide which I like best, the natural, roasted pork chop, the grass-fed beef and lamb fettucini or the fried chicken. Paraphrasing a well known comedian, I don&apos;t know what they did with that chicken, but it&apos;s (beyond) delicious. Anyway, I haven&apos;t even had everything on the menu yet and already I have some favorites.

Bar area with TV, limited window seating, high tables, regular tables. Street parking. Average noise level. Good for romantic dining and for families with a limited number of kids in tow. Nice draft and bottled beer selection including a local Kilt Lifter; very good wine list. Highly recommended.",The fried chicken is amazing! I&apos;ll definitely fly back from L.A. for this! The service is also amazing,Great cozy local restaurant that has a changing menu seasonally with great tasty food. It is one of my favorite restaurant that I always like to go.  The environment feels intimate and relaxed. Well packed place but barely need to wait for an open table.,"What a hidden gem! We used to be in this area a lot taking one of our pups to the dog park and had no idea this was here. We stopped by for lunch today. You order at the front, pay, and then find a seat. There are probably 15 tables outside so we found an open spot and sat. We barely had to wait for our drinks and food! I was really impressed with the fast service. 

We got a flight for $10 and it was fun to taste some different local beers. The ciders are not available to be part of a flight. The fried cheese curds were SO delicious-I love them and they&apos;re tricky to find. We split the fish and chips and the batter was well-seasoned and flaky. 

We enjoyed watching the kite surfers and wind surfers from the patio. We noticed that they were busy since it was such a nice day that tables weren&apos;t getting wiped down between customers which made me a little uncomfortable in our covid world at the moment. When we&apos;re in the area again, we&apos;ll be sure to stop by.","4 stars for the great brews, views and customer service. I&apos;d definitely skip on the food here though. Had the fries and onion rings. Overly greasy and portion sizes were tiny. Otherwise, they do have ample outdoor seating (covered and uncovered).",Do the walk thing in the park and live.a.little -the.brews are tasty and so is.the.food--try the Magnuson Park Burger with bacon jam and.black pepper Dijonnaise on a Macrina Brioche Bun @  $ 13 or.the  Crispy Chicken Sandwich with Buttermilk fried Chicken Thigh on a Macrina Brioche Bun @ $13.50 both are awesome-- takeout of.course but.you can sit in the outdoor lean to shed or.the garden green houses with heaters--this is a real find--cheers al,"Very beautiful brewery on the water of Lake Washington. They have a limited selection (approximately 15 beers/ciders) but they are local, so that can be a plus! Currently they are offering a decent selection of outdoor seating. You must wear a mask when ordering. It is also a dog friendly spot, and there were tons of cute doggos when we visited. I enjoyed the black sour. It tastes like a dark beer but has a twist at the end of a sour. Prices are decent.","This is one of my favorite breweries in Seattle. The food is good. The beers are great. There&apos;s a beautiful water view. Service is friendly and respectful. Plenty of outdoor seating, covered or heated. It&apos;s such a relaxing and fun time here. There is vegetarian options and the beer menu rotates seasonally. The beers are a lil pricy but it&apos;s worth it since some of my favorite Hefeweizens are here.","Beautifully designed Cafe and Brewery along the Sand Point Way in the enormous Magnuson Park in Seattle. Seating options include- indoors and outdoors- protected and heated patio, open deck and dome seating. Fish and chips and burgers seem to fill up weekday menu items with special brunch menus for weekends. Fish and chips that came with coleslaw I tried and enjoyed was terrific selection.",Great food and excellent service! Very reasonable prices. Loved the &quot;Sit wherever you want&quot; policy!,"Had a pretty good dinner at Magnuson Cafe!  We were seated relatively quickly and the service was very nice! Also the ambience is cool and I could see myself coming back with friends again! 

My friend is vegetarian and got the Black Bean Burger with fries and I tried the Normal Burger with added fried egg and tater tots! I was satisfied with my food; it made me full but it was just a pretty good burger. Nothing spectacular, but good still! Will come back again if I want a beautiful view + some good food.","We bought a GroupOn for our experience here, which definitely helped us discover this awesome brewery. It&apos;s off the beaten path, and at night is in a really unique area. So glad we traveled here because the beers were right up my ally! Honestly, I am super picky as I just started liking beer. The selection they had was so unique, from a mimosa-inspired beer to a black cherry/coffee flavor, it was all so good. One of the first flights I&apos;ve had where I finished every beer and my partner didn&apos;t have to help me lol. Come here for great flavors and unique beer!",Portobello Mushroom burger was a big disappointment with only grilled onions on it and a LOT of sauce.... the bun was very soggy. The Brussel sprouts were really good and pretty ok cheese curds. Great beer though. I look forward to giving them a second try but I&apos;m skeptical.,"I hate writing bad reviews but this place definitely deserves it. The only reason I would even give this place one star is the location and establishment itself. Dogs are allowed but only at the &quot;outdoor seating&quot; 

The staff is horrible, and seem very young and don&apos;t know anything about customer service. It&apos;s a brewery so naturally before ordering a beer you want to try one or two before making a choice. I asked to try two different beers and the server seemed annoyed that I even asked to try. I chose a cider which was good but not the best. My friend ordered a burger and asked for cheese but when it came- no cheese. No problem, but the server once again seemed very annoyed and blamed it on the kitchen and asked if she still wanted cheese... umm yea? And took it back very angry. My veggie burger was HORRIBLE. The bun was dry and came with no sauce. I guess I should have paid the extra $2 for cheese so my burger could have some sort of flavor added to it. The patty was mushy and overall not edible. I asked for something else hoping the nachos would be better but no. I waited 20 more minutes for it to come and when it finally came it looked unpleasant. Hardly any cheese (which was cold) or toppings (see picture for example). I should have just ordered chips and it would have been cheaper. It comes with a side of salsa and sour cream is extra?! 

After all of that mayhem our waiter stood at the front and must have told the other servers we didn&apos;t have the best experience with food because they kept looking back at our table clearly talking about us for a good 5 min even with the &quot;manager&quot; which made us feel so uncomfortable. I would never come back or recommend this place to anyone. Save your money and go to another brewery in the area!","We decided to come here after going to the Magnuson park with our dog. I was truly hoping that the 3.5 star rating would prove me wrong, but it was correct. The parking was relatively easy even though it was a Saturday. Our server was a sweet gal and she was prompt about our orders and answered our questions patiently. 

Mollusk brewery did not disappoint. My husband and I got 2 types of beers: a CREAMY IPA and a plum sour. I have the IPA descriptor in caps for a reason: it was soo good. I was hoping we brought our growler to bring some home with us. We will be back for that at least. 

As far as food goes, we ordered the Magnuson burger and the fried chicken sandwich with fries and tots. Basic enough to get a feel for the other food. That is where Magnuson failed. There was little to no taste to both entrees. We take burgers very seriously &amp; these were not burgers we would go out of our way to get again. They lacked salt! The Magnuson burger was weirdly sweet, totally took us by surprise. The fries were the best part! Tots not so much, they were soggy and tasteless. 

Overall, we loved the views of Lake Washington and the beers, but not so much the food.","Service here was honestly pretty terrible. I went for a ride on the Burke Gilman and wanted to stop for a brew and a bite, not thinking it would take 2.5 hours. I ordered the bbq flatbread. The first time the server forgot to put it in, the second time they brought out a pesto flatbread and the server rolled their eyes at me, the third time they forgot it again and brought out fries as an apology, the fourth time my item that should have taken maybe 10 minutes emerged. It wasn&apos;t too busy so I don&apos;t even know what they were doing back in the kitchen!","This place is amazing! On the water, plenty of parking, delicious food, and service with a smile - what could be better? Shiny new board games, that&apos;s what! We decided to try them out for brunch and were so glad we did! Apparently they opened in July and without any advertising had a huge opening. I&apos;m clearly not in the know and missed the warm summer months I could have been here every day! Well now I know! 

We ordered the veggie scramble, the veggie bowl, and the turkey wrap with fries. All parties were pleased with the hot and fresh food that came out. While we waited for the food we played Apples to Apples (the new version! So fun!) and had our coffee. We only got through a few rounds before our order was up but it was a good way to pass the time with friends. We will definitely be back for a tasting flight next time! We had the plum dubbel and the IPA with spruce tips at the winter fest on Friday and loved them! Very impressed!","This place is definitely off the beaten path, but worth the trip. There is a huge parking lot so not worries there. 

We came on a Saturday afternoon and grabbed a couple apps and 2 flights of beer. I&apos;m not a huge beer drinker - but I really enjoyed all 4 of the ones I picked out. 

For food we got the chicken wings and pesto flatbread. The wings were well cooked and high quality meat, however we felt they could have used a little more sauce or flavor (even though we got the spicy kind). The flatbread was exactly as expected - nothing special but it was fine. 

The place has a great outdoor space with tons of patio seating. It&apos;s a great place to sit and enjoy some sun and take in the water views. 

I&apos;d definitely come back for a nice afternoon outside.","Been here twice now once in the Summer (great view especially if you are able to sit on the upper patio seating area) and once in the Fall (not a lot of seating inside but enough for what is obviously a slower season for them). The beers are tasty and the food is quality. During lunch time they have a lunch combo which is nice so you can mix and match. I had the chili which I think was lacking in flavor. The burger I thought was great nothing too exciting but at the same time it wasn&apos;t trying to be.

I play soccer quite often in the summertime at Arena Sports so I will for sure be back.","This cafe and brewery has been open for just over a month and it&apos;s evident in the kinks that need to worked out. 

What does it have going for it? A killer view of the north end of Lake Washington, a large, dog-friendly deck, a solid (but not phenomenal) range of beers from Mollusk Brewing, Beermosas (if that&apos;s your thing), and a tasty brunch menu. 

What needs help? Service was patchy and slow. The wait for our food was longer than expected and our waitress, although friendly, was not attentive. We had to flag her down after we received our food because she didn&apos;t make the obligatory stop to ask if we had received everything okay. One couple next to us even left in a huff after 10-15 minutes because they hadn&apos;t been attended to. 

We learned that there may be a cover added to the deck so that there is some shelter from the change of weather coming soon. The question is, can they work out the kinks in speed and service to make us want to return?","First customers in line when they opened at noon.  Ordered milkshakes, burgers, fries, salad for 3 people.  Other people in line start receiving their burgers and sandwiches before us.  After 20min, I go up to see what the issue is and server says &quot;I have your stuff right here.&quot; When he brings it to the table, I complain that other people were served first.  He says &quot;sorry we forgot your salad.&quot; Our burgers and fries got cold while they made the salad? &quot;No, they were under the heat lamp&quot;.  Really? 
 
We saw a guy walk out with a milkshake when we realized our milkshakes haven&apos;t come out yet.  We received those 10min later.","Came here with a few friends for a drink and appetizers a few days ago. We ordered a round of flights and realized that 80% of the beers there were some variation of a juicy IPA, not the diversity of beers that Mollusk is known for. So we ended up getting many of the same beers. When the flights arrived, the bartender spilled some of the flight on to my friend&apos;s lap.

We ordered some cheese curds, but when they came out, it looked like just a block of cheese had been fried with bits of empty fired batter balls thrown in too. It was small for what we expected and definitely not enough to appetize the 4 of us. The waitress came by and offered to take the curds off of our order too.

The place is great for the neighborhood, but for the price and inconsistent quality of the food as well as the limited tap list, it&apos;s better to just go somewhere else. The best part of our experience was the wonderful wait staff and bartenders.","Magnuson Caf√© still has kinks to work out on what would otherwise be basically acceptable pub fare and beers. Prices are surprisingly unremarkable, especially for a new brewbub that has the current monopoly on cool within its tony strip of neighborhood on Sand Point Way.

So why only 1 star? 

The service and ambiance are so unsettling, chaotic, jarring, and frenetic that its forgettable food doesn&apos;t even matter. This is not a relaxing place to sit and enjoy life, which is a shame because it has a lovely east-facing view of Lake Washington. Folks yelling, babies screaming, dogs snapping, things spilling, servers running around always behind: imagine this happening on what should be a lazy, quiet Sunday afternoon on the lake with a beer in hand. Does that sound like fun to you?

I don&apos;t like to write a bad review for brand a new establishment, but if a joint is going to open up, it ought to be ready and organized enough to welcome guests and make them feel comfortable. 

Seat yourself? 
Name on a list? 
Hello?  
Can anyone greet me?  

The waitstaff is well-intentioned but scattered and overwhelmed. No one seems to know exactly what&apos;s on the menu, whose food this is, if this is the right table, et cetera. This place desperately needs a manager who can train the wait staff, sort out the ordering system, and pull the whole scene together with verve. 

The management also needs to decide whether the deck is going to be a playground for children and dogs, or a safe, welcoming spot for neighborhood diners to enjoy a pint and a bite. As a veteran, trained service industry worker myself, even I would have difficulty navigating this jumbled up mix of daycare and kennel. 

Sorry, but the &quot;deck + alcohol + food + dogs + babies&quot; business formula equals zero stars in my book. Subtracting dogs and babies will easily correct the equation.","This food truck came to our work in Georgetown. 

I had the kpop one which came with kalbi beef, kimchi, and pepper Jack cheese. It was delicious!! A little on the salty side, but the kimchi definitely help cut it. The kalbi was flavorful and tender, the kimchi tangy and crunchy. I would order this again.","Staff is crazy nice and I love their product for what it is... It&apos;s super tasty fish shaped waffle! We ordered ours with strawberries and nutella and it was spectacular! The crispness of the waffle is perfect and the filling was better than I expected. Be careful because the inside is scorching hot! 
I plan on returning sometime soon and bringing my kids. They would love it!","I&apos;ve seen BeanFish on my Instagram feed for awhile, but never had a chance to find their food truck before the Stay at Home order was put in place. So I was happy to find out they&apos;re on UberEats (seems to be only available on Saturdays 12-5pm on UberEats).

I went with their &quot;mmmBacon&quot; (bacon, egg, tater tots, Tillamook cheddar cheese, and freshly chopped green onions), &quot;K-pop&quot; (Korean Kalbi beef, Tillamook pepper jack cheese, and kimchi), and finished it with &quot;Oh Sugar, Sugar&quot; (cinnamon sugar sprinkled inside and out, with a side of maple-butter syrup). The waffle fish are pretty small, which makes sense given the price. However the quality of the food made me wish the price was higher, if it meant some of the ingredients and overall quality improved.

&quot;mmmBacon&quot; ($6.36) - Came with 3 hefty slabs of bacon, which would have been great except 2 of the slices were pure fat. Before popping it in the oven, I noticed the slices were also under cooked in the middle, so something to be mindful of if you&apos;re ordering and eating on the spot. There was a good amount of green onions without overwhelming the taste, and they were fresh! There&apos;s supposed to be tater tots, but mine had one small one cut in half (sadness).

&quot;K-pop&quot; ($6.36) - Okay, I really enjoyed how they balanced the spice of kimchi with a sweet sauce. However their Korean Kalbi beef threw me off. The beef looked more like mini meatballs you&apos;d find in Chef Boyardee. I cut one in half, and the middle was a dark red. Saw that and said &quot;not today, Satan!&quot;, and removed the &apos;beef&apos;. Nobody has time to risk food poisoning. The rest of it was tasty, but I think they should just rid of the &apos;beef&apos; or sub in actual slices of marinated beef or thin slices of tofu.

&quot;Oh Sugar, Sugar&quot; ($3.63) - A good finisher after eating the savory. I reheated it in the microwave for 15 seconds, drizzled the side of maple butter syrup, and let it sit for a few minutes to soak in. Even with it being a waffle and with all the sugar, it didn&apos;t have a heavy taste to it. It was the smallest out of the 3, so some may find the price a little much.

If I find myself near their food truck, I may try a few other items on their menu, but for now it was just &apos;okay&apos;.

Tips:

-Their prices are slightly higher (about $.50 per item) on UberEats. Not sure if it&apos;s to offset the cost they pay to UberEats, or if it goes directly to them (hopefully it does).

-Getting a savory one to go/to eat for later? Heat it up in your oven with their recommended 350 degrees for 5 minutes. Your kitchen will smell delicious, and it gives the &apos;fish&apos; a good crisp. Don&apos;t go over 5 minutes, as the waffle browns quickly, any longer and you&apos;ll risk burning it.",These folks were at the Century Apartments and I have to say that their custard fish is ah-mazing. Most snacks are under 5-10$. I couldn&apos;t get enough.,"Hard pass... inconsistently cooked, not crispy on the outside like you&apos;d want in a waffle. Also soggy and under cooked in the center for one and rubbery bacon in the second. Gross and a waste of money.",I have no idea how you could give anything less than 5 stars. I was completely blown away. I was lucky to be able to taste test 5 different options. All were outstanding. I particularly liked the colonol custard and roscoe san. I will be following this food truck for sure.,"People are really  really nice but if you want taiyaki, this is not it. Outside is mushy and taste like salty  pancake.  Ao
I am also pretty sure red bean is not Japanese or Korean red beans, as those are sweeter and more expensive then Chinese canned red beans.","There is no &quot;review&quot; here, only a command. 

Get your a$$ up off the sofa or whatever... and stick a BeanFish inside of your open mouth, immediately. 

Ok?

I keep having one of these every year or so and then I remember that I want to have them every day. 

3 is too many, but get a savory and also a sweet. 

Do yourself a favor. 

Are you a good boy?

Do you deserve to be happy?

Go get a BeanFish.

One last note, and it&apos;s important, eat them immediately. Don&apos;t hold it. Don&apos;t have it delivered. Just go for it. They consistency is made to eat fresh. You don&apos;t make a waffle and walk 30 blocks to eat it. You don&apos;t √ºber order a waffle.  Are you crazy? Eat the BeanFish.","Tried these guys yesterday at a brewery event in Woodinville. We didn&apos;t even get beer; we drove all the way just to try BeanFish. It&apos;s officially been 3 years we&apos;ve been meaning to try them and they did not disappoint. There was always a line while we were there--we parked nearby and ate in the truck and they were churning out orders non-stop.

They have a long list of savory and sweet waffles. Check the photos--they all come out looking perfect, and they&apos;re easy to eat with your hands. 

We got the Mr Roberto, which is chorizo and such inside. Very flavorful, just a little hint of heat, and perfect in combination with the dough. It&apos;s like a perfect breakfast sandwich that kinda looks like it was made for little kids, &apos;cause it&apos;s a fish. They all look like kids&apos; food, really, but they&apos;re so good you don&apos;t even think about it.

The K-Pop advertises itself as being either kalbi or bulgogi inside (I should remember but it&apos;s slipped my mind). It was delicious, but the filling was definitely lightly-seasoned ground beef, not a short rib or any other cut. Still pretty great, but could probably stand a re-write on hte menu. 

The Colonel Custard is one of their more-famous dessert waffles. It&apos;s really good, but I could only handle a bite since it was so sweet. Later in the day I might be able to handle the sugar. 

The prices here are very fair. One waffle would fill up most people for quite a while. I can&apos;t wait to see these guys more often. I even got a sticker to put on the beer fridge in my garage.","This food truck has a great concept. Taiyaki are awesome and I encourage people to try them. They are essentially fish shaped waffles, traditionally with red bean filling. Got the Jiro (standard red bean) and crackyaki (gooey butter filling with extras after Milkbar in NY). 

The crackyaki was definitely a good dessert and I&apos;d recommend trying it. The Jiro was decent, but the res bean filling needed more sweetness for me, and needed to be more smooth. 

I&apos;ll be coming back to try their other creative options, and you should too.","This truck for me was in the right place at the right time. The food was really good, I had the MmmBacon. The sweat ones look really good but I held back from getting one. Quick friendly service and delicious food. 
The portion was small so if your hungry order a couple different ones to sound out your lunch.",Customer service was great! They answered all my questions and were really patient with me. I just got the traditional red bean taiyaki and it was really great!! The batter was super fluffy and soft. The red bean was sweeter than I would have preferred but still delicious. If I pass by the food truck again I&apos;ll definitely come back to try other flavors!,"BeanFish?  Ewww....what&apos;s a BeanFish?  Doesn&apos;t sound so appealing.
I&apos;m so dumb.....it&apos;s taiyaki. Seen this food truck around a lot, so I decided to get a couple of fishies for lunch.  

On this particular day, I&apos;ve eaten at all the food trucks that were parked at Westlake Park in downtown, except BeanFish. Staring at their menu before making a decision, they have a good amount of selections, so it was tough to decide. They offer sweet, savory ones, so I decided to get one of each.  

I got the &quot;MmmBacon&quot; and it was pretty darn good. Delicious stuffed waffle shaped like a fish, with thick cut bacon, eggs, tater tots, cheese and some green onions. Perfect for those who like breakfast options for lunch. It was nicely stuffed and it was tasty. 

Then I got a sweet option and checked out the &quot;colonel custard&quot;. Waffle itself was the same like all the other ones, it was plenty filled with vanilla custard. Good sweet option! 

BeanFish was tasty and glad I stopped by. Prices are ok, the fishies are a little small for the price but they don&apos;t really skimp on the stuffing, at least for mines. Staff was friendly, takes about 5 mins or so to make, I ate one walking back to work, I should&apos;ve gotten 3.","I&apos;ve had my eye on this food truck for a while and was pleasantly surprised when I saw them at the Summer Solstice Market at Magnuson!

They have a lot of different choices, and it was hard to pick one. We ended up getting the mmmBacon, the matcha one, and the one with strawberry&amp;nutella.  They were a little on the pricier side, but they do look very good. They called our name and we picked them up. The mmmBacon was tasty, everything was well cooked. The bacon was good. The matcha was okay, and the strawberry and nutella was our favorite. The service was okay, not particularly friendly. 

I liked this place, although a little smaller and pricier. I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way for them, but if I saw them I might stop by to grab one.","Piping hot and fluffy made-to-order taiyaki! Both sweet and savory options are presented, and they frequently introduce new stuffings.

Below is what was available at my time:
- Jiro (aka &apos;The Original&apos;): sweetened organic red bean ($4.54).
- Roscoe San: katsu chicken, sweet red bean chili sauce, cheddar cheese, and slaw ($6.36).
- One Twelve: peaches and vanilla custard ($5.45).
- Princess Ichigo: fresh strawberries and Nutella, dusted with powdered sugar ($5.45).

I picked the Jiro Taiyaki and was delighted by its freshness and perfect cook time! It was well stuffed with the sweet red bean paste as well. To be honest though, it is indeed pricey considering the size of the taiyaki.","This food truck comes to our office park pretty often. I&apos;d seen the name several times and I didn&apos;t know what to make of it so I went a long time without trying it and I regret that! One day I asked if anyone knew what it was and my co worker explained that they were fish shaped waffles with various fillings, so of course I was intrigued. I headed down and ordered a Nutella waffle and i was hooked! The waffles are not only so tasty and perfectly fluffy with a slightly crispy edge, but the filling is great! I had it again yesterday and got the s&apos;mores one which was even better than the first. The woman who takes the orders is very nice, and they move through the line quickly. Definitely a must try if you haven&apos;t!","They&apos;re great! ....my boyfriend and I normally devoured the &quot;fish&quot; too fast to take any pictures. It looks good and tastes good everytime. Their ingredients are always fresh, it&apos;s tough to have so many stuffing choices but Bean Fish never disappoint. Our favorites are the Original Custard, the Elvis and Bacon, but we&apos;ve recently discovered the Curry Ramen one and fell in love with it! It&apos;s worth tracking down their truck! Promise!","I found BeanFish at the night market at Magnuson Park. It was a cold rainy evening and I wanted some dessert. Of all the options, some taiyaki looked nice and warm! I chose the Jiro. I felt I couldn&apos;t go wrong with a classic and didn&apos;t want anything to be overly sweet. Mine was $4 but prices increased based on the complexity of fillings you choose. There are sweet and savory options. 
The taiyaki was so satisfy on a cold day. It was crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy inside. There was so much filling and it was warmed throughout. I&apos;d want to try the matcha custard one next time!","I ordered the k-pop, which was a fish pancake with beef, cheese, and kimchi. The kimchi was cold, which wasn&apos;t the best paired with the rest of the pancake, but the beef and cheese were delicious and the flavors balanced well together. I&apos;m a big fan of savory flavors, so I was glad that they had options other than the typical sweetness of the classic red bean paste filling.

On a cold winter day, it was nice to have the warm pancake in my hands, but the fish got cold so quickly, and honestly was way better warm. However, the bread component of the fish was crispy and paired deliciously with the sauces in the rest of the pastry. Kimchi is one of my favorite flavors, so my eye was immediately drawn to the fish that I chose, but I&apos;d be willing to try out some of the other types of fish if I were to come around the area again!","Happened upon this food truck when visiting Daiso. They were parked across the street from Uwajimaya on a Saturday afternoon. I&apos;ve been wanting to try this place out and felt it was a serendipitous shopping excursion.

They have a bunch of fun sweet and savory flavors with clever names. I love me a good taiyaki so opted for the &quot;Jiro aka the original&quot; red bean. Their system is easy enough. You pay with cash or card and they take your name so they call you by name and not what you ordered (very smart system for a food truck). 

We got ours, beautiful presentation and only a 5 or so minutes with one ahead of us in the queue. The taiyaki are made to order, so prepare for a bit of a wait. However, we&apos;ve ordered taiyaki elsewhere and felt this wait was reasonable. When we retrieved our order, not too impressed with the taste of the batter. But the cook was fabulous as well as the filling. If they&apos;re at a farmer&apos;s market I attend, I&apos;d definitely order again.","This place serves simple, healthy food that tastes great. I had the peanut bowl with tempeh which I loved, and my mom got the cheezburger which she said was excellent. I got an iced dirty chai and it was spectacular! I wish they were open for dinner on weekends.","Menu is a bit limited and they don&apos;t really have a lot of warm &amp; cozy food, but for an almost raw/whole food eatery they have pretty great flavors and portions. This Tofu &amp; Peanut bowl from Broadfork Cafe was exactly what my body was craving: Peppers, cabbage, kale, carrots and tofu over brown rice and millet dressed with a flavorful peanut dressing (I asked to add yams). 

Raw &amp; whole foods can be a little boring sometimes because it&apos;s just cut up veggies, but this was delicious! David and I hardly even looked up from our plates as we scarfed our meals down! 

Comfort food and comfort eating is great, but don&apos;t forget to listen to your body and give it what it needs. It&apos;s all about balance.",Give credit where credit is due! Lentil burger and avocado kale smoothie are both out of this world good!!!,"Awesome healthy plant-based food. Why would you eat meat if plants could give you all the essentials, including protein. A lot of thought has been put into the food at Broadfork Cafe, and I salute them for the effort. We had the carrot ginger shot to start, comes with a little orange slice too. Brilliant and refreshing. And then, we had the peanut tempeh bowl and plant protein bowl, both were good. 
I would recommend this spot if you like to put in thought into what you eat.","Yum! I arrived around 7:30 on a Tuesday evening for a casual dinner with a couple friends. 

Yay for an all vegan menu and lots of healthy, tasty options! You grab a menu from the counter then order and take a number, seating yourself. I ended up going with the Tempeh Peanut Bowl (~$11) which includes brown rice, lightly browned tempeh cubes, broccoli, bell pepper, kale, carrots, red cabbage, peanut sauce and peanuts. I also ordered a glass of the Communitea Kombucha (~$6). 

The place was fairly quiet and our food only took 10 to 15 minutes. The kombucha is lightly fizzy and funky... I personally prefer a fizzier funkier booch but it was decent. I did enjoy my healthy, flavorful bowl. The portion size is a reasonable amount. I could have finished it but didn&apos;t want to stuff myself so I took the rest to go. My friends seemed to enjoy their Grilled Kim-Cheese (~$10) and Burrito + smoothie. 

The girl behind the counter was nice and the experience was pleasant overall. It&apos;s a great option for a healthy, tasty, and casual plant-based lunch, dinner, or snack.","Man I would love to get this place a better rating... 
I&apos;ve been a regular for over three years and I think it&apos;s finally time  to write a review. 

Unfortunately I would have to say my number one complaint about this place is actually the incredibly slow service. There has never been a time that I have come and the food has come out quickly. 
No matter what time of day or how busy. 
I frequently try to call ahead to order food due to the slow service and they almost never pick up the phone... which honestly makes it that much more disappointing that there is no way around the slow service. A few years ago I figured it was a result of being a young business. I assumed they were still learning how to staff their restaurant correctly and learn efficient systems for getting quicker service. I think it&apos;s been very disappointing to see no improvement... And even worse no apology or acknowledgment. Yikes 

Second biggest complaint is not their fault but parking in their area is terrible. I highly recommend parking on the side of the street that has the YMCA. 

Third biggest complaint is the high cost. 
I make organic vegan food at home all the time and it cost nowhere near what they charge for some things. 

Now for the good stuff! I have always loved that this restaurant has wonderful morals, ethically sourced food, great quality, unique fun recipes, and tasty food!

I love their selection of chai, their beers on tap, their siders, and absolutely love their raw desserts!

If you can find parking, and have the time and money I would say it is worth going for sure!!! 

A few things I absolutely used to love about this place was that they had what was called the community bowl where you could purchase it based on what you could afford which I just thought was such a generous idea!! They also used to have a pay it forward program where you could purchase a future coffee and stick it on a board for a homeless person to come and redeem! I&apos;m not sure if they still have the community bowl but I know they don&apos;t have the pay it forward program anymore which is disappointing.

I have always thought that the decor was unique and interesting and I love that they usually have lots of plants! I can tell that they are trying but in my opinion also failing so many areas... sorry broad fork. I will keep coming back but maybe only for a little while longer and only a couple times a year.","A casual vegan spot that we found in Seattle University District.  Lots of bowls, entrees, and vegan desserts which were all enjoyed.  Ingredients are fresh and local.  Staff are friendly.  Biggest gripe is price as portions and quality are comparable to Veggie Grill.","Please avoid this place. I ordered a green juice, and this is what I received. Rip off, I did not pay $8 to get Apple juice, this place is stingy.",So the food was really really good but I&apos;m docking it 2 stars bc it took forever and a year to come. We were like 2 of 6 people in the entire restaurant and it took like 35-40 minutes to get our food AND it was super expensive. My &quot;cheese burger&quot; with a side of soup was almost $20. I would want to go back for the food but probably wouldn&apos;t for the price and how long it took.,This place is great for vegetarian food and delicious smoothies! It&apos;s probably the best vegetarian option around UW outside of the Mediterranean food. The staff is super helpful and friendly as well!,"The perfect place for a healthy vegan meal! I ordered the cashew curry bowl, it came with a ton of rice, fresh veggies, seasoned tofu, and a curry sauce that gave tons of flavor without being too heavy. Service was also super quick and friendly. Definitely recommend!","After attending an event in the University District, we were hungry and in search of vegan options.  This was an amazing option.  They had Finn River Cider on tap and great choices for food.  I am really excited we found this place and will be back soon!","First of all, FIRST. Guess what, the person who picked up the phone made me repeat myself 5 times. Not only that I had to spell out words several times. The pickup wasn&apos;t so bad, is what I would say if they didn&apos;t get my order wrong. Ok but everyone makes mistakes, I went back to pickup my order again. Surprisingly this time they got it right, but hey who doesn&apos;t love missing key ingredients.... cough cough AVOCADO. But hey they did play themselves and give us another free meal unintentionally and for that you get 2 stars.","I had to write this review while it was still fresh in my head! At first, we arrived to find parking and I&apos;m looking for &quot;Broadfork Cafe&quot; everywhere. I&apos;m like woah, this place looks familiar. Pretty sure I interviewed here once.

Then I walk closer and this is the old Chaco Canyon! I don&apos;t mean to bring up the past but my first impression of CC was so horrible! I waited over 20 minutes for my interview and never got called up... and I ended up leaving. So you can see why I had a bad taste in my mouth as I walked into Broadfork Cafe.

However!! This was my first time trying out the food and it seems to be under new management so I decided I will give it a try. I really just wanted to try the &quot;BBQ Pulled Jackfruit Sandwich&quot;. My love for BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwiches are through the roof and after becoming vegan, I have been on the hunt. I&apos;ve seen recipes online but I don&apos;t have time to cook and as soon as I found out they have it! I was determined to try it.

You can guess what I ordered and I dragged along my carnivorous boyfriend with me who ordered the Grilled &quot;Kim&quot; Cheeze! Ah, I love grilled cheese sandwiches but kimchi? (I&apos;m also Korean) It sounded very dare-devil like in my opinion! But my boyfriend likes to live on the edge of things so he ordered that! 

I was starving and I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s a vegan thing but every vegan place we&apos;ve gone, food tends to take a wee bit longer to come out! Maybe after 20 minutes have gone by, we are looking around and meet eyes with the staff in the kitchen. A man comes out and apologizes that there was a mix up and they will make it as soon as possible! Luckily, our  strawberry banana smoothie came out fairly quickly and helped curb the hunger for a bit longer.

Afterwards, another person came (the person who took our order prior) and apologizes once more and says we can have dessert or a coffee drink on the house after our meal! Of course, who can say no to VEGAN dessert?

Okay, enough about me blabbing. So how was the sandwiches?

Uh, frikken delicious?! I mean it&apos;s not 100% close to the real deal but as a substitute, I am more than satisfied with replacing pork for the jackfruit look-alike. I ended up throwing the salad into my sandwich because I needed a bit more greens and crunch (from the carrots) and it was perfect.

The Kimchi Grilled Cheeze was most definitely interesting... It definitely was I don&apos;t know how to explain it, you just have to try it for yourself. I think I liked it but I don&apos;t know how often I could order it.","I love this place! We ordered at the front and then chose a seat. The service was a bit slow (it was a Sunday) but the very kind person who took our order came and offered us a cookie or a coffee since the wait was longer. We shared a tasty vegan peanut butter and chocolate cookie while waiting for our bowls. The tempeh peanut bowl is wonderful ($11), full of bright flavors and delicious veggies. They gave us larger portions due to the wait so we had enough to take home for another meal. I will definitely be back!","Friendly service and good food! As good as I can expect vegan place to be. I&apos;m not vegan but I prefer eating vegan or vegetarian. 

I had the Smashed Chickpea Avocado Sandwich and it was good for the most part except the bread texture was not the most appetizing. It came with a side of soup or salad so I got the Egyptian Red Lentil soup which was very good! I ate half the sandwich and soup and it filled me up. 

Bit on the expensive side but expected since it&apos;s vegan. I would definitely come again",Wife and I came  here on a Sunday afternoon thinking it was still Chaco Canyon &quot;guess we weren&apos;t paying much attention &quot; since we haven&apos;t been here in awhile. But we were still pleased with the food and drinks! Some reviews had to wait a long time but we waited a normal amount of time so no problem for us. We got a Kim Cheesy sandwich on GF bread and it was very good. Along with a tomato basil soup. Yum!,"I had a delicious meal here with a freind. I had the Risotto cakes, and the lentil soup. She ordered some sort of broccoli tofu curry. It all tasted delicious! 

This place is mostly self serve so I can say much to the service. They food tasted great! We also took a Vegan chocolate candy bar to go. It was delicious!","Back here again for plant-base foodÔºåhave Ginger noodle bowl, kick burrito and Yam &amp; Kale Bowl this time. Looooove it!!! All of them are soooo delicious.Always come here and try something new on menu and never go wrong!!!","We ordered the jackfruit bowl and the seasonal bowl. It was super bland, they topped my jackfruit bowl with plain un-seasoned coconut cream. Everything needed salt. I told my husband that this place gives vegan food a bad name.","Setting: We did take out because of COVID. Picking up the food was super easy as they had a side window dedicated to picking up food. 

Food: We had the Badenjan Borani and the Murgh Kabab with the Badenjan Borani side. Both dishes were phenomenal. The eggplant was perfectly cooked and the chicken was flavorful and tender. Thankfully the chicken was not dry. The rice also tasted amazing in addition to the pickled sides that they give. 

Value: This place feels overpriced, with each dish being about $20-$30. We ended up paying $50 for two people. Our favorite Afghan place in Fremont, CA charges $13.99 for the Badenjan Borani and $14.99 for the Murgh Kabab with similar quality and higher quantity. With that being said, there is not a lot of Afghan food in Seattle compared to Fremont. 

Service: The staff were very pleasant, professional and kind. They took COVID precautions and even offered me hand sanitizer as I picked up to the food. 

Other: The food is amazing but it is definitely pricey. However, during these difficulty times for small businesses, we were more than happy to support this amazing restaurant and will likely go back!","We have been coming to Kabul for 5 or 6 years now and have added two kids to our family in that time, both of whom have been welcomed with open arms (during non-pandemic times, of course). Pre-COVID, we had the same waiter every time and even under less than ideal circumstances now, he asks the person picking up take-out about our family&apos;s health and genuinely cares about the customers who come by. 

I used DoorDash once or twice at the start of the pandemic, but they must add on significant fees to each dish somewhere in the process because the food was roughly $30-50 more expensive than when I have picked up. Calling in the order and picking it up with a mask (the staff wears masks and gloves and cleans high touch surfaces between customers) also means that one less person handles my food, so I don&apos;t mind at all. 

Our favorite dishes are: 

- Ash soup
- Bolani turnovers (my 16 mo old son eats the yogurt dipping sauce by itself because it&apos;s so good)
- Qorma-i-Sabzi (vegetarian spinach dish)
- Chicken and/or lamb kebabs (add the eggplant; it&apos;s phenomenal)
- Firni pudding for dessert

My husband has a number of food sensitivities that make restaurant food challenging, but because of the wide variety of vegetarian/vegan options that are still extremely tasty and the staff&apos;s knowledge of what&apos;s in their food and willingness to make tweaks, we look forward to eating here for years to come.","Please support these guys! We got takeout from them tonight and it was delicious. There was a snafu with the order that was our fault, not theirs, and they were so gracious with helping to fix it. Loved the veggies and lamb dish.","We are foodies and have dined from food trucks to 3 Michelin star restaurants around the world. This is one of THE BEST RESTAURANTS in the Seattle area! We love the food, service, very cozy when able to dine inside. Highly recommended.",My friend who comes to visit from Portland loves this place and I can see why. The service (during pre Covid times) was excellent and the food was very good. The have a mix of meat and vegetarian dishes and I let my friend order since he has been here many times. Lamb is always a big hit. Have not been to try take out since Covid. I enjoyed the food and the service.,"Perhaps our friend&apos;s inecessant raving about this place set our expectations higher than Afghanistan&apos;s Mount Noshaq. Or, perhaps it&apos;s the fact that at $35.00 a pop, you&apos;d expect racks of lamb to be larger and have more meat than grandma&apos;s set of dentures. But sadly, no.

We came as a group of four, were promptly seated at a nice table. It was still early on a weekday, but there were already two or three tables occupied. Decor is nice white linen service and the service is absolutely effusive, deserving of a star in and of itself, which is why this review is three stars.

We started with Mushroom Qorma and Burta. The Qorma was delicious, well seasoned, but alas too small! Both were gone within a matter of minutes till one of us got tired of doing the, &quot;Oh no,YOU have the last piece - I couldn&apos;t&quot; and finally did. 

Two of us each had a glass of white wine made somewhere in the Middle East, but the wine left a bitter aftertaste and did nothing to enhance the flavor of my entree, which was the $35.00 rack of lamb.

And I quote from the menu: 

Rack of Lamb - $35.00
A GENEROUS (caps mine) portion lamb marinated in garlic, coriander seeds, lemon juice, turmuric and touch of cayenne pepper. Served with Badenjan Borani, Basmati rice, Salata and Afghan Bread.

If you peruse the Yelp pictures of the rack of lamb, you&apos;ll find that the most GENEROUS portion of this dish is the bone. Each bone is accompanied by a piece of meat that is not larger than the size of the irregularly-shaped mole I had removed from my left shoulder two years ago.One or two of the chops had only gristle or inedible tendon - no meat.

In fulfilling my wifely duties, I gave two lamb chops (out of the 4 or 5) to my husband, who promptly returned the one with meat to me, as he saw I was gnawing on a lamb chop bone, thereby fulfilling HIS husbandly duty. Yes, the bones were well seasoned, everything was &quot;tasty&quot;, but there just wasn&apos;t much to &quot;taste&quot;. We finished off sharing a dessert and tried eating our spoons till we remembered that metal isn&apos;t digestable.

A disappointing experience, given the fact that I wanted to give a great review for a long-standing, locally-owned neighborhood restaurant.","This place used to be great but has gone downhill.   Undercooked chicken kabobs. That, alone, would be enough for a one star review, but even if I wasn&apos;t doubled over in the bathroom today, the tiny expensive portions wouldn&apos;t have been worth it. So sad because we have had good experiences here in the past.","One of the finest place to have Murgh (chicken) Kabobs. Period.

Their food is very authentic, delicious. It has yummy flavors and aroma. Meat was cooked to perfection. We tried the same dish twice and it did not disappoint at all. 

Their appetizers are also very unique. Never seen them elsewhere. We tried Burta and Ash.. Both were equally good. The only tiny complain I have is that all of appetizers are vegetarian. They have good selection of wines. But I think they are bit pricey compared to other restuarents.

Service is good and staff is very friendly. Place is small and cozy but has good ambiance. Its also quite. 

I would definitely recommend the place for those who want beat their hunger with yummy meat and flavors.","This place is amazing. I will definitely come back. The cook/ chef or whoever prepare and cooks the have a golden hands. Everything was delicious, juicy and tasting great.",The BEST restaurant in Seattle. This place is always consistent delicious and so warm when I get it right out of the box. The baklava is seriously mouthwatering and has so many layers to sweetness of it I just don&apos;t understand. The murgh kebab is amazing. It&apos;s cooked perfectly well it taste crispy but moist and it&apos;s packed with natural flavors. I feel so much better and more energized after eating at Kabul Afghan cuisine. They have a lifetime customer in me!,"Best, tenderest, most flavorful lamb I&apos;ve ever had. Eggplant is also phenomenal. Convenient pick-up window for takeout during quarantine. Fantastic service. Strongly recommend this place!","Kabul is a hidden gem of Wallingford. The food here, while a bit pricey, is delicious and wonderfully seasoned. My favorite dish is the lamb kebabs. The lamb is cooked perfectly and has so much flavor! They also have vegetarian and gluten free options which is great. I definitely recommend you try Kabul if you want some great food in a quieter setting!","We have been eating at Kabul for over 15 years and we have never been disappointed!  I would rate it 6 stars if I could!  Their eggplant is the best I have tasted in Seattle and the murgh chicken kebabs are absolutely divine.  My wife and I eat here at least every other month and we have never once had a bad meal - in fact it is always delicious!  

If allowed I would give Kabul 6 stars for delicious food, incredible consistency and a great value!  It is one of our main go to places to eat in Seattle!  Thank you Kabul!!","Good food. There are a lot of vegetarian options. Lots of flavor and not  too spicy. The yogurt sauce is perfect . I would also recommend the cardomon tea, firni. 

I think it&apos;s a little pricey; I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s an yelp thing .  An entree costs about $20 and cannot be shared, the portion sizes are suited for one person. And I am a light eater.

I will definitely come  here again to try out more.","My first taste of Afghan cuisine and probably one that is going to be incredibly hard to beat! 
Pros:
Best dishes on the menu:
Drink: Yogurt based drink with mint and spices. (Forgot the name)
Entrees:
Bandejan Borani: Three slices of fried eggplant topped with garlic yogurt and tomato sauce and beef. Flavour in every bite!
You can add a side of basmati rice for 4 dollars more.
Bara Kabab: Marinated lamb with rice. Best Lamb Ever. Period. You can add a slice of Bandejan Borani on the side.
The waiters are friendly and welcoming. 

Cons:
The only reason I have reduced a star is because of the price point, quantity and wait time for food.
It took a really long time for us to get our food after ordering even though the restaurant was not too busy, the food however was totally worth the wait so this was forgiven.
On an average each dish here costs between 22 to 35 dollars which is NOT cheap. For the price point I would expect a good quantity but that was not the case. For example: the Bara kebab costs 22.5 dollars and comes with just 5 small pieces of lamb.
Likewise the Bandejan Borani costs 22 and comes with 3 medium sized eggplants. 
But again, the food quality is fantastic, so I would pay good money for this. 

Overall, Kabul was a great experience and I&apos;ll be back!","Took my grandma here and had a great time. The food was so good. Our server was a great help in explaining what everything on the menu was.

I went here once before and had a bad experience with a previous male server but the food was good enough to come back and risk dealing with him again. But thankfully it was someone different! 

We had the roasted eggplant, lamb kebab, fish stew, and the most amazing rise with raisins and shredded carrots! So good!

It&apos;s also good to know that they only open for dinner starting at 5pm.","Kabul Afghan Cuisine is my first experience with Afghani food so I can&apos;t speak to how authentic it is or how it compares to other Afghani restaurants but without knowing what to expect, I very much enjoyed the food and my experience at Kabul.

The experience is what really makes this small family owned restaurant so amazing. My friends and I were greeted with a very warm welcome from the staff and owner when we came in; joking with us and saying that they would impress us and convert us from first time customers to returning customers.

I do agree with some of the other reviews that price is a little high for how little meat their entrees contain but the portions are quite large. We ordered the Sheekh Khebab and the beef was quite dry (not sure if that&apos;s the style though) but the flavors were amazing. Especially the cumin flavors in the basmati rice. This place is also amazing for vegetarians as all their appetizers and half their entrees are vegetarian friendly.

At the end of our meal, we decided to try their Firni and the owner teased us for getting just one dessert to share among 3 people so he treated us to Baklava on the house. I wasn&apos;t a fan of the Firni because of how floral it was from the rosewater but the baklava was delicious!","We ordered the two person combo meal with chicken and lamb, which also came with an eggplant dish (amazing), rice with raisins (also amazing), and a pistachio rosewater pudding dessert of some kind (very good). The meat itself was probably the most disappointing thing, as it was dry and definitely needed some kind of sauce (it was served plain).","I came to Kabul to try and satisfy my fiancee&apos;s craving for vegetarian Persian food, which is hard to find because it&apos;s not a thing. The menu here had many dishes that were familiar to me, albeit different. Imagine going to the grocery store and getting the off-brand cereal, something like a &quot;Rice Crunchies&quot;.  That&apos;s what Afghan food tastes like to me. The Veggie Qormi-Sabzi is similar to the stews I grew up with but different (more spinachy, less sour, no kidney beans), served over spiced basmati rice with raisins and carrots. The Ashak was different from anything I&apos;ve had before. It was described as &quot;ravioli&quot; but the pasta wrapper is barely perceptible and filled with herbs, topped with a tangy creamy sauce with ground beef. We also had dogh (yogurt drink) and salata (diced tomato and cucumber in lemon juice). I personally prefer Persian food, but that&apos;s largely nostalgia driven. They do have a larger vegetarian section than most Persian restaurants, with a spacious interior space and friendly service.","Kabul is one of my favorite Seattle restaurants. When I get back into town, it&apos;s the first place I go, or in these times, the first place to get takeout.
I should probably be more adventurous, but I always order the Kabab Murgh (chicken)  with the badijan bourani- eggplant with a garlicky tomato sauce and yogurt finish. The rice is incredible- amazing Afghan spices with raisins and carrots. You will know that you ate garlic if you order this, but hey, that&apos;s Afghan cuisine. I have to come all the way from a Hawai&apos;i to eat at Kabul - if you&apos;re lucky enough to live in Seattle, visit there often.
Oh! Almost forgot! Try the pistachio rose water ice cream for desert. Brilliant.","The decor inside is very nice with an outside deck overlooking the marina. I&apos;ll come back in warmer weather to check that out!  This time I ordered for takeout. 

I ordered the bourbon mustard meatloaf, which came with two slices of meat topped with onion rings, garlic mashed potatoes, and a mixed veggie. Very tasty, and really liked the blend of veggies. For a cocktail I chose the Sazerac. This is not for everyone, but I do recommend trying it especially from here. The absinthe was in the one large ice cube so it slowly melted into the drink. 

The phone order process was pretty easy and asked to be ready in an hour. When I arrived there was a long wait. It did seem like there was a small rush right before I got there and got lost in the shuffle. The staff was all very pleasant.","I had a Yelp discount for an entree and a cocktail, and used it to get dinner tonight. Yelp asks you to call an hour in advance to place the order, when I called in my order, they said it would be ready in 15 mins. They agreed to have the food ready in 40 mins, the time I needed to get there for pickup. The food was ready to go when we got there.

I got the Grilled Fresh NW Salmon and the Cosmo as part of the Yelp discount. I also added Spicy Habanero Mac balls, and Alaskan Cod &amp; Chips to our order.  

I loved the Grilled Salmon entree, the salmon was fresh and grilled right, mashed potatoes were amazing, the butter sauce on the salmon was delicious, I wanted more of it. Cod was good, the fries a little limp, but it took us about 30 mins to get home, so it wasn&apos;t ver surprising that they didn&apos;t stay crisp. The Habanero Mac Balls were good, not very spicy for us, we finished it. 

The Cosmo was great, loved it.","I used to work on Eastlake back in 2011 - 2013. Often drove past Eastlake Bar and Grill for several years to cut over towards Capitol Hill, detouring from the UDistrict to downtown Seattle when I-5 would be backed up, or dining at the Japanese restaurant across the street. I&apos;m sure the Lake Union and Portage Bay views are beautiful from their outdoor deck during warmer months.

However, this is my first ever visit to Eastlake Bar and Grill (2/15/21). I&apos;ve visited their two related restaurants though located over by Green Lake and up north in Lake Forest Park.

Thanks to Yelp Seattle, Eastlake Bar and Grill is featured as this week&apos;s designated Yelp YES destination 2/14/21 through 2/20/21.

Notified Yelp Elites are able to select an entree and signature cocktail for $15, pre tax and tip. My entree is regularly priced at $24.95 and signature cocktail at $10. Very generous dining opportunity and greatly appreciated!

Cocktail selected was a Bourbon Swizzle, crafted with Michter&apos;s bourbon, Fernet, Neal Deal ginger liqueur, simple syrup, lemon/lime juice, splash of soda and mint. Generous beverage takeout, I added ice at home. Notably a larger serving compared to most cocktails from other establishments. Nice and smooth! Guess I&apos;m not doing my taxes tonight, lol.

Entree selected was the aromatic Grilled 12 oz NY Steak with garlic mashed potatoes, added a pat of butter at home. The balsamic brussel sprouts were substituted with caramelized carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes, corn, and red pepper or pimento.

The NY steak was grilled nicely, topped with chives, and seasoned perfectly. The only thing amiss was it was medium versus the requested medium rare. The entire entree was so generous, I ate only half.

I also ordered an additional entree selected by The Homie, Three Pig Mac and Cheese ($17.95). The three pig components were bacon, pulled pork, and crispy prosciutto. Alex added grated parmesan and hot sauce. The latter was recommended by the gentleman who handed me the takeout bag. This entree was also a generous portion, since a teenager appetite was satiated with remaining leftovers.

I called in a little after 5pm where I was transferred to the manager. Because it was post Valentine&apos;s Day and after the snow storm, I was told my order would be ready in half an hour. Yelp Seattle recommends calling one hour prior to pickup. I was able to drive to/from Shoreline in under 45 minutes total and entrees remained hot.

There is street parking along Eastlake, but the restaurant has their own convenient, wrap around private lot. I opted to enter, completed payment onsite at the host stand. There is the option to call upon arrival and have curbside service.

Remember to mask up prior to entering the restaurant site. Overall customer service from the initial phone call placing the order, onsite to complete the transaction, and then handed my takeout bag and cocktail was professional, welcoming, and order received as promised.

Yes, this evening&apos;s word throughout this review is &apos;generous&apos;.

It seems I am learning from my recent posted reviews that I need to shake it up and stop driving past established places, like Eastlake Bar and Grill.

Late to the party, but thanks to Yelp Seattle, Eastlake Bar and Grill is a terrific find. Recommended!","*Disclaimer: I received a discounted meal as part of a promotion for Yelp Elite.*

Came here for take-out during COVID. I ordered the New York strip &amp; Boulevardier cocktail. The good: the portion size was ample, and there was a good mix of veggies/sides. The bad: the steak was undercooked (I ordered mid-rare, and it came out rare), and the meat was exceedingly tough; the fat had the consistency of rubber and was not edible. This could be chalked up to a meat quality issue, or a food prep issue, not sure. But overall, it made for a less than stellar meal. The ugly: both the steak &amp; the cocktail are overpriced. The latter was the equivalent of a shot of whiskey for a normal price of $12. The steak is normally $25. I would not pay full price for either. 

Overall, I think this place is good if you want some quick bar food in a pinch. Other than that, I would not recommend a special trip.","This spot definitely has wonderful views and I never heard about it till the Yes Meals event. Went for a lunch this afternoon and it is really good! Ordered the Prime rib dip and my drink is the best- Pink squirrel. The ribs were so yummy and it&apos;s been a good experience, thanks to my amazing server Andrew. I called in an hour ahead and ordered my food for to go, so it was ready by the time I reached. 
Thanks Yelp and Eastside grill for this wonderful opportunity!","Stopped by Eastlake Bar and Grill Wednesday night as they were featured as part of the YES meal program that I saw through Yelp Elite. You get 1 dinner entr√©e and a cocktail for $15. I got the NW Salmon as my entr√©e and a Cosmo for my cocktail. And boy was it amazing! The salmon was fresh, so tender, and that sauce was to die for. The mashed potatoes were delicious and the veggies were grilled perfectly. My boyfriend and I split the meal and added some homemade pasta we made the night before and more veggies. 

Couldn&apos;t have asked for nicer people, service, and when I went to pick up the outside dining was so adorable and perfect that I wish I could have sat in and dined in. Don&apos;t forget to give a generous tip---these local businesses need it! And we want them to stay open! We will be stopping back soon!","Surprisingly super good meatloaf meal set! I think it was the bourbon sauce and onion rings that won me over though. Despite the rings being soggy they still had a bite and a very nice flavor profile to the breading. Definitely not a frozen onion ring. And that sauce, it was so sweet, I loved it. Couldn&apos;t taste the bourbon though. The meal was hefty, two slices of meatloaf atop mashed potatoes (which were said to be garlic but I couldn&apos;t taste it) and came with a side of roasted parsnip, carrots and potatoes...though there was something in there that was suppppper bitter. The menu had said it came with brussel sprouts, so I was pretty disappointed to find none. 

Overall, it was a solid meal and service was really friendly over the phone and during pickup.","Good place for quality American food. Parking is limited. Service was fast and friendly. The food itself is very filling despite the initial portion size. The fries were good, great seasoning on it. The fish was okay, it was thick and the batter was kind of like a beer batter. Overall good experience!","I used to come here a lot a long time ago but with streets closed near it on Fairview it is harder to access for the past few years. So, hopefully with the street opening up soon I will come here again more often. The daiquiri I had was very good and on point to what the classic Hemingway should taste like.  The 3 pigs macaroni was the star for sure with large amounts of pulled pork, bacon and prosciutto on it. I will for sure come back for the brunches and mimosas in the future.","We stopped in here earlier in the week. It was our first time out in 3 months due to Covid. We dropped in for drinks on their patio/deck. 

We had to wait maybe 10 minutes for them to clear a table. Our server was Addie and she was just soooo sweet and on top of it. She took our order right away and just made our first night out such a nice experience. Thanks Addie!! 

Overall, they definitely are doing social distancing which is much appreciated! Some tables had mini tents over them. Servers were wearing masks and gloves. You scan a QR code off the table to bring up their menu. 

We didn&apos;t eat but we&apos;ve eaten here many times in the past. We usually pop in for happy hour. Food is so so not great but not bad, just fine for quick and cheap happy hour food. Service is usually very friendly. 

Overall, this is a convenient place to drop in for food and drinks. They have parking lot. Their deck/patio has a great view and perfect for summer. Service is friendly. Only 4 stars b/c food can be pricey for what you get off their regular menu.","Girls date with my friend and I really enjoy the view! The server is really sweet and told me I can pick any seat I want, I picked a spot under the sun first but after 10 minutes it&apos;s burning hot for me so I asked can I move to other spot, and they let me! I love the Gin Berry Fizz, tasted like juice and it&apos;s really refreshing especially during this hot summer time. 
The salad is pretty good, paired with salmon! The salmon cooked perfectly and it doesn&apos;t taste fishy! the salad is fresh and croutons are crunchy! They added perfect amount of the dressing and didn&apos;t feel overwhelming . I personally hope they would put more cheese in it! But overall it&apos;s pretty good! 

Food: 8/10 
Environment: 10/10
Service: 10/10 (the serve is really funny, and when my friend asked what sandwich should she get and he gave her good recommendations! Then he touched his belly and said &quot;I know beer and food the most!&quot;)","I came here with a girlfriend just as King County entered Phase 1.5 of reopening. They had a fantastic setup on the patio with little plastic tents to separate tables, and you were still able to enjoy the gorgeous view. 

We ordered a bottle of wine (which was an incredible value, honestly. They had a list of $15 bottles!), a cheeseburger for my friend, and the chop salad for me. I greatly enjoyed my salad, plenty of toppings and dressing without the salad being drowned. I also snuck a couple of my friends fries and they were quite good! I really love that they were seasoned, rather than just plain potatoes with maybe a teeny tiny bit of salt. 

The servers were very friendly, and checked in often enough to make sure we had everything needed but not enough to hurt the flow of conversation. I will definitely be returning with my husband for a date night here!","We were a big group of hungry woman, they found a perfect spot for us, with 2 tables (4 people each). We arrived after a long bike ride and the service at this restaurant was fast and the food really good.","Standard dive bar with decent food and lots of craft beer options. We went here while waiting to go to sushi kappo Tamura across the street. There&apos;s lot of seating available and was surprisingly busy on a weekday night. We ordered a beer flight, couple shots of vodka, a cherry mule and a few appies. They accidentally gave me the wrong beer flight and gave me the extra glasses without charge. I wouldn&apos;t come back here just for the food or drinks, but it was a good place to kill time while waiting to go for dinner",Good food and drinks &amp; a great outdoor seating section. The food wasnt the best but i did like it. Expensive. Might come back only when happy hour returns,A group of friends and I went out to eat right after they reopened from covid closure. We had an excellent experience. Our service was a little slow but they were quite busy. Food was awesome and the spicy Mac &amp; cheese balls are a MUST. I&apos;ll definitely be going back!,"The best Happy Hour in the Lake Union area. Period...

Awesome location with great views of Lake Union. Service was awesome too. I had the... 

Top Deck Chop Chop Salad $5: pretty solid, not mind bending but 3.5/5

Oyster Shooters $5: I really like these. Really meaty and fresh with a garlicy cocktail sauce. 4/5

Lake Union Mule $5: pretty good 3.5/5

This was a very enjoyable Happy Hour and the values are off the hook. Check it out.","Great place for lunch on this Gorgeous day! Jonathan gave us excellent service. Great music, Yummy food. Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup, Almost Reuben and Seasoned Fries. We Will be back to try dinner sometime soon.","Being that it was walking distance and my choices are limited for lunch spots, I tried this place out on my lunch break. I&apos;ll say this, if your pressed for time, sit at the bar. 

We sat down on the patio and was there for ten minutes before we got water. Decided to move to the bar and from there everything was good. 

The food is delicious (I had a chicken club) and a decent lunch menu. I wish I could have washed it down with a nice cold one but was on the clock. 

There are some other menu items I&apos;ll be back to check out on my time. Parking is limited but if you can find it on the street you&apos;ll be good for two hours. Ahaha. 

I hope this helps in your decision to come here.","So this place has pretty good food, has a great view though. The waitress didnt introduced herself or tell us the specials, she is the reason I didn&apos;t do 5 stars, she only came by a few times, I had to wave her down and ask another waiter to get her and another waitress (think was the manger) for the check.. But other than that the food here  was good. My mom had a burger and said it was really good, ( it was cooked without being burned) I had the tomato basil soup and it was delicious!","GREAT BREAKFAST! 

This is a great pub came and watched the Ohio and Michigan game and to eat some breakfast. 

The server tad was super cool he made sure we were well took care of. We ordered a Bloody Mary, biscuits and gravy, and French toast. 

The drink was strong and great! Helped with my hangover. The biscuits were perfect, probably one of my favs. I got over medium eggs and the cook made them exactly how I like them. The French toast was golden. 

Definitely a great place for a good morning breakfast. Will be back soon","Never again.

I&apos;ll try to keep this brief. The atmosphere, TVs and pool table were all fine. The beer selection wasn&apos;t great, but wasn&apos;t terrible. This single-star experience was due to one thing: the staff. The woman behind the bar began our experience by asking my friend &quot;What are you doing in a bar?&quot; after he&apos;d just explained that he no longer drinks. Who makes fun of a sober alcoholic for NOT ordering a drink?! Reminder- this place has a full food menu. He should be perfectly welcome to walk into an establishment and order something non-alcoholic. 

Separately, we put $5 into the jukebox only to have the same bartender turn the jukebox off in favor of her own music. When we approached her about this politely, she was callous and pointed to a hand-written sign on the jukebox. It read something like &quot;Jukebox will be turned off during big games and no refunds will be provided.&quot; 

I have two issues with this. Number 1: In our scenario, the jukebox may have been turned off after playing only one of our songs, but it wasn&apos;t out of respect for a game-- they were playing bad 1980s hip hop in lieu of our paid-for song selection. Number 2: The sign specified big games-- can any Seattleite think of a single &quot;big game&quot; that took place on Saturday, 5/11/2019? There wasn&apos;t one. In fact, I checked the screens and the interest levels of the other 5 customers in the bar- no one was paying any attention at all to the Mariners game or the other random sporting events on the TVs. Flat out, she wanted to listen to her own music and had an attitude about it when we asked her why our selections had been utterly ignored. 

This girl probably shouldn&apos;t even have a job (my opinion). If you think I&apos;m being over-the-top, check out my other reviews and see that I don&apos;t typically say harsh things about any establishment.","This is probably a favorite. My friends and I hang out here often and enjoy just drinking &amp; hanging out whenever we get the chance. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. Dim lit, nice pool table (free games on Sunday I believe)

There&apos;s also a jukebox. 1$ gets you 2 credits, 2$ gets you 6 credits. 2 credits gets you a song. You do the math.

Other than the drinks, I love ordering from their kitchen because all their food menu items are just made so well. LIKE THEIR FRIES, so crispy so warm with ranch &amp; buffalo sauce hmmm","Bravo to this staff and establishment for having a kickin&apos; USWNT watch party. The spot was overflowing with supporters, but overall an orderly experience. Even with a purchase of one item, no one seemed upset if a patron or many patrons didn&apos;t order anything... they were too packed to get everyone&apos;s order.

The vibe is great for soccer supporters, though not a spot for any specific BPL team (Arsenal and ManU/City stuff in the same bar). But hey, great place!","The Atlantic Crossing is my kinda of place!!

Our Thursday night running group showed up with about twenty people for some after run drinks and dinner which may have overwhelmed the staff of two (bartender / food server &amp; cook) but they were awesome and we had a great night!!!

Big shout out to Elizabeth the bartender, she had a full house of people ordering drinks, food, more drinks, and anything else that could be thrown at her and she was amazing with the help of a damn good cook!!

The Atlantic Crossing is a British / Scottish style Pub with lots of personality, the bar has little brass name plates screwed to it with the names of regulars. There is a great patio in the back that makes a phenomenal place to sit and visit with friends while enjoying an amazing Seattle evening. There are big screen TV&apos;s showing sports and ample seating for a smallish place, and my favorite thing about this place, it&apos;s kinda dark (perhaps dimly lit is a better description) inside which I just love!!

The food was very good, portion size was OK or maybe a little on the larger side, and the prices were fair.

I was in a British / Scottish style Pub so I had to try the fish &amp; chips right!?!? Good choice on my part because it was fabulously delicious!! The breading on the fish was crisp but not hard and the Cod was flaky, juicy and tasty!!!

Several of my friends ordered the burgers which all looked amazing and I heard no complaints and saw a lot of empty plates. 

I could go on because I had a fabulous evening, thank you Elizabeth for taking such good care of us even though you were slammed, and please believe me when I say that the Atlantic Crossing is a great place to spend some time. 

Until next time my fellow Yelpers, ..... Be Local, .......... Live Local, and whenever you can, ..... BUY LOCAL!!!!","My go to spot for brunch EVERY weekend. The eggs benedict and potatoes is out this world and all my friends love the hangover bowls. 

If you&apos;re looking for a pub to watch any soccer match at, look no further, Atlantic Crossing is the spot. The bartenders are friendly, timely, and they always make a mean Bloody Mary.

Take time to admire the plethora of jerseys on the wall or order a pedialyte if you&apos;re still feeling the effects of last night.","Atlantic Crossing is a great neighborhood bar with some of the friendliest staff I&apos;ve encountered in Seattle. 
There is something to draw in everyone. You like soccer? They play the games. You like wings? Tuesdays are $1 wing night. You like beer? They have some solid taps. You like burgers? Wednesdays are half off burger night. And did I mention that the people who work there are ridiculously nice?? 

The food is pretty good, too, with a pretty wide menu for a bar and stuff that&apos;s more creative than your typical bar food. I&apos;d recommend the suicide fried chicken sandwich (crispy chicken on a brioche bun with a nice spicy kick) and stopping in for wing night. The wings are solid, and as someone who usually goes for 4 stars at a Thai restaurant, the medium spice is perfect. (Although they do have hot, suicide, and all the way up to homicide levels if you&apos;re that hardcore.)

Street parking in the area is not *too* hard, if you go onto the side streets. There is only one toilet for each gender, which can probably cause a wait on busier nights. There&apos;s plenty of seating both at high tables, regular tables, and the bar. And there&apos;s pool if you&apos;re into that! All around, very solid bar, with great vibes and food.","Re-downloaded Yelp just to write this review, so hopefully that&apos;s telling of this place.  Also, go see Andrew H&apos;s review in 2014 for similar content - we were honestly surprised at the recent ratings because these raving reviews are not congruent with our experience one bit.

Saw Atlantic Crossing advertising 50% off burgers on Wednesdays, and as my girlfriend and I have lived in the area for a year, we figured it was time to finally check it out tonight.

We went in and liked the dive feel of the place!  It was charming in a certain way, and the bartender working was really nice.  I imagine it&apos;d be great for an Arsenal or Sounders game.  Anyways, we ordered two burgers (shown on menu as $11 each at full-price for just the burger) and a basket of curly fries.  

The food took a little while, which was strange because only four or five other groups were in the bar.  The burgers came out first, aaaanndddd to say they were underwhelming would be considerate.  My girlfriend joked that Walmart patties have better flavor, and there was little toppings to go with a large, bulky bun and a surprisingly small patty.  It wasn&apos;t a big deal, because we figured that we got a fine deal.

The curly fries came out next, which turned out were french fries as the bartender thought we ordered those instead (she contended that we just said &quot;fries&quot;... which we did, but also with the word &quot;curly&quot; in front).  It ended with a &quot;sorry, next time!&quot; which is unfortunate.  Alas.  The fries were actually the bright spot.  I considered giving this review a 2-star because of them!  They were crisp, warm, and sizable.

So, we thought we got out alright.  Yes, we had some sub-par burgers, and yes, we had ordered curly fries, but, we figured we would get out cheaply and not regret passing up a night at the delicious and kind Rain City Burgers across the street.

I went up to the bar and asked for the check, and noticed that the burgers were not half-priced from the $11 represented on the menu.  Being a little peeved at this point, I traced it back to the menu (still $11 on there), and mentioned to the bartender that I believed there was a mistake on my bill.  She looked at the check, and goes &quot;Oh, people get this wrong all the time.  It says half-off burgers at the bottom of the burger list, but that is misleading.  It&apos;s actually only 50% off of the Angus burger ($8 at full-price) and then all of the toppings you get on the burger type you choose are full price (bringing up our total to $8.75 on one of the burgers).  She laughed and said that she had been trying to explain this to the owner for a while, but it was a common problem and got customer comments all of the time (she also threw in another &quot;Well, now you know for next time!&quot;........ thanks.) Note that this pricing is represented nowhere on the menu - it blatantly just says &quot;1/2 off burgers every Wednesday.&quot;

My girlfriend and I left bummed, not because we overspent, but just because we felt scammed.  It&apos;s one thing to make bad burgers and forget what people ordered, but a whole other thing to design your menu to deceive people into thinking they&apos;re getting something they aren&apos;t.  Shame on you, Atlantic Crossing.  

If you&apos;re looking for good food and honest people (at the same price, mind you), head across the street to Rain City Burgers.  Their burgers are phenomenal and it would feel good to know they&apos;re getting your business instead of these guys.",I just had a great brunch.  Loved the English breakfast and $5 mimosas.  I almost took them up on the $3 pedialite special to help recover from last night.  I will definitely be back.  There are also member discounts and the bartender was super nice!,"Loved the chicken sandwich and curly fries!  This place has great music and if you don&apos;t like it the jukebox is accessible via the app, so you can change the vibe up!  If you&apos;re a soccer fan and a fan for good food, check this place out.","Came here early on Saturday night, was sort of expecting a crowd because the UW football game was happening. Alas, the place was pretty quite. The crossing has fairly typical British sports bar feel, and I think there main selling point is as soccer bar. I decided to have a mushroom burger, and it was OK. I think that a better burger could be had a Rain City just across the way. My burger was pretty dry, and the mushrooms didn&apos;t really taste like they had been saut√©d much and it didn&apos;t come with any grilled onions which is pretty standard on that type of burger.  Wait staff was really nice and attentive- just wish the burger had been better! Not sure if it is worth a return visit on my end unless I was perhaps wanting to watch premier league or La Liga matches.","Solid Ravenna local with an English/European bent. Pool, darts, an excellent (and somewhat unusual, sporting a number of import taps) beer selection and thorough liquor and cocktail selections.

Soccer fans rejoice: it&apos;s almost always on here. One caution: surprisingly, the bartender enjoys crappy hip hop music and will turn it on LOUD if she feels the place is empty enough to minimize complaint. Prompt and courteous enough service though, and I&apos;ll put up with a good bit of annoying noise to get a favorite pint.

Solid food, including a don&apos;t-miss Scotch Egg, perfectly cooked with runny yolks, crisp outer crumb coating and spicy sausage, served with a smooth mustard sauce for dipping. Their other pub-grub selections are generously portioned and similarly well-executed. Sharp cooks here!

Good clean store, nice sporty decor and classic English pub feel. One star off for pollution (both from the sound system and the poorly ventilated restroom- both fixable problems and minor).

Recommended stop if you&apos;re in a drinkin&apos; mood.","This place scores a completely solid MEH.  It&apos;s Meh, to put it simply...the food is well meh, the menu not super surprising or good, the smell inside is that of a stinky dive bar and the servers are nice enough but not super attentive even when the place is slow (we were there and only one of 3-4 tables total so it wouldn&apos;t have been hard to be attentive... I swear I&quot;m not an attention whore but when I would have ordered two drinks instead of one..that is their missed opportunity). Anyhoo...I digress. If you are just looking for an okay-ish place to sit and Meh with your friends, here it is Meh it up fancy pants... but as for me. Nope not coming back.  Not even for the scotch egg... and that was meh too incase you were wondering.","A pub for the Beautiful Game and Brougham Faithful.

This is an official Sounders FC pub and one of the best I&apos;ve watched a match in (Also: The Berliner in Renton). Where some pubs will only play the game on a few screens, AC plays Sounders on all tvs.

Lots of beers on tap and a full bar. On my latest visit, they were serving a special, rare beer by Jameson called Stoup with a shot of Jameson in a little barrel hanging on the side. So good! So fun!

Food is solid here - get Brit Pub favourites like Bangers &amp; Mash, Shepherd&apos;s Pie and Scotch Egg appetizer ($6). They also have a ton of burgers and even some things for Veggie lovers like Deep Fried Avocado Tacos - tasty! Most entrees run about $10 - 12.

The atmosphere here is what you&apos;d hope for - people are friendly and the service is great. Definitely The Place to watch a match - just get there early if our boys are playing!","The Atlantic Crossing gets my vote for being the best pub/sports bar. 

The atmosphere is laid back and nonjudgemental. You can dress casually and comfortably. People here are usually hanging out, playing pool, or watching sports. Last time I was here, my friends and I were at a table, chatting. The music was at a perfect level where we could talk comfortably. 

The drinks are pretty standard, and are always served by the nicest and friendliest bartenders in Seattle! They will approach and serve you at your table, but are also happy to serve from the bar when busy. The staff create a very welcoming environment.

I have never eaten dinner here, but I love the snacks! The menu has a number of ideal drinking foods. The SCOTCH EGGS are amazing. One order comes with two eggs, each cut in half. I will be happy to return here many times in the future!","Atlantic Crossing is a cross between a sports bar and a neighborhood bar. If you come here for the sports then you have plenty of positives like TVs that can be viewed from any spot in the bar, beers served by the pitcher and bartenders who are willing to work with you to make sure the game you are looking for is broadcast on one of the televisions. One thing that all sports fans should know. This is a SOCCER bar above all else. So the Sounders will be on before the Seahawks. Fortunately that conflict only vomes up around once a year. 

As a neighborhood bar you hve plenty of positives as well. The service staff has been working there for a while and they will remember you once you have been in a few times. The drink and the food prices or reasonable so it wont break the bank for you to drink here. The juke box is full of plenty of good stuff to listen to and i can say from experience that you never know what is going to be playing. But the true hidden jewel of this place is the back patio. Not only is it big with plenty of seating, but there is also a big screen tv out there and a covered section so you can watch it when the weather is not ideal. 

Sadly with all the new construction going on in seattle and the price of real estate rising cool bars like Atlantic Crossing are closing down. I hope we get to hang on to this spot at least a little while longer.","Fair food, delicious curly fries, good staff who you get to know. Plus, the trivia on Sundays is free, interesting, and pays out in gift cards.","Love this place.   A great neighborhood bar, and is my go to place for a beer with friends.  Check out Sunday night trivia with Sally!

I haven&apos;t been there to watch a soccer game, however, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s a great time as there are 2 huge TV&apos;s and other tv&apos;s that you can see from wherever you&apos;re sitting. 

The food is great there.  I think I&apos;ve tried almost everything on the menu, and aside from the dill they add to the fries,  I haven&apos;t had anything to complain about. 

I will say though,  you will walk out of the bar smelling like grease.  But it hasn&apos;t stopped me from coming back.","My friend and I wanted to try somewhere new for brunch after dealing with a few too many crowded noisy brunches at portage bay. We settled on Atlantic crossing and we&apos;re so glad we did! Taylor, the bartender, was awesome. We both got biscuits and gravy and added on $1 bloody Mary&apos;s (which were super tasty and Taylor even made my friends a bloody Maria, which made her day) and it was probably the best biscuits and gravy either of us have had in a while. It wasn&apos;t too crowded which is rare for a seattle brunch, and the sound track of music from the 60s &amp; 70s set the scene perfectly. We will definitely be back :)","For a young town, Seattle sure closes early?!   Thankfully,  the AC serves their full menu LATE AT NITE!  Their burgs are hand patted and, their lamb burger can&apos;t be beat! So delicious!","The Black bean burger is to die for, the tomato basil soup is awesome. Great selection of beers and wines.","***SUPPORT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD INSTITUTION***

We all love our neighborhood pub. You can support them in these difficult times buy buying a gift card here: 
https://ko-fi.com/latonapub/commissions#buyCommissionModal",This place was adorable!  We stopped in for drinks after getting tattoos around the corner.  The drinks were good and the food coming out of their tiny kitchen looked delicious.  If I&apos;m ever in the area again I will certainly stop in for food.,"Totally fine, totally serviceable. It&apos;s &quot;good&quot;, as in not bad, but not great; not special, but not a letdown.

If you&apos;re nearby and feel like a pub stop, it&apos;ll do the trick -- this place is exactly that, no less and no more.","We live very close by but just went here for the first time last week. Their draft selection varied, the staff were helpful and friendly, and their food was extremely tasty. Oh my word. I think that we all know bar food can be very hit or miss, but this place definitely lived up to their reviews. We had the Brussels sprouts, chicken pot pie, and grilled cheese. Everything was made to order, came out piping hot, and was very satisfying. It was a great spot to grab a drink and catch up with an old friend without being disturbed, but definitely was not slow in business. Next time we come back I really want to try the jalape√±o bacon dip!","Went with a friend for a late lunch. Very uninviting, (even with COVID). All their bar stools seats removed and the staff needs to go! Sadly I have always come here for one of their menu items that is no longer on the menu. The one person working there is as rude as they come. The person I was with told me later that they almost jumped over the counter at the guy because he was being such an ass. On top of that, there is automatic tipping. Any tip to that server is too much!!!

Sorry Latona Pub, I will never come back. With the attitude of some of your employees, your business may never come back, when this virus plays out.","Decent spot for a bite and a beer. I had a sour and an IPA and both were tasty. They had a couple options of a number of types of beers (IPAs, sours, ales etc.) and good breweries on tap.

The food was simple but good. I got the bratwurst plate and would definitely do it again. The skin was crisped lightly, sauerkraut was not too vinegary and the beer cheese was fantastic. Knowing that I probably would get the beer cheese next time.

The reason for 3 stars is that the waiter missed my order so my poor date had to sit there and wait for my food which we didn&apos;t realize was not on the way. The guy was nice about it but her food got somewhat cold by the time my food came out. I expected him to give a discount because it threw off the meal but there was no discount on the meal.","I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Although the food menu is a bit limited the food is great! I&apos;m not much of a beer drinker, but I really liked on of their sours. This looks like a local hangout for many regulars. 

Only thing I&apos;m not crazy about is the seating. It&apos;s a little uncomfortable 

This is a good place to chill with friends.","A really great place to grab a beer and a bite. We went on a Friday night and loved listening to the jazz trio they had playing until 7. We were with a group of 6 and were seated quickly because we had called ahead. 

Everyone in the group ordered beers and burgers. The server was nice and knowledgeable, and the service was quick. They also have a good variety of cider options for non beer drinkers. 

Overall, it&apos;s a nice neighborhood spot that I would definitely go back to for a beer, music, etc.","Honestly, one of our all time favorite places in Seattle. This is a locals haunt. Great tap list, and easily one of the best menus around. This place is synonymous with best grilled cheese and tomato bisque, two things I don&apos;t even like or order elsewhere. The duck salad is other worldly, as is the meatloaf, Mac and cheese, ... basically everything I&apos;ve ever had here. Nice to sit outside with the pups on a nice day!","Honestly there is so much I love about this place it&apos;s hard to get start but here we go!

1 If you like amazing food that&apos;s both comfort style, tastes like it&apos;s chef home made and also is made sure to have a interesting detail or twist that makes the meatloaf not the one you grew up on but it&apos;s fancy uncle who just adds pizazz to an already delicious recipe. 

2. If you like a relaxed vibe, a neighbors hangout vibe, the same amazing staff seen regularly and amazing service to top it all off, then I don&apos;t know why you haven&apos;t found this spot till now!

3. I saved what I believe is the best of bests at this place for last. LIVE JAZZ FRIDAY NIGHTS during happy hour. I can&apos;t even describe the happiness, the ease and content feeling you have sitting upstairs looking down on that upright base and sax just swooning to the beautiful music feeling like this is exactly where you should be and your heart is full.
Clearly I love this place on another level but it&apos;s no accident that it&apos;s always busy and that the first timers become regulars so often. 

Moral of the story, if you want to enjoy an amazing meal that has home cooked comfort while being cooking show level crafted, you want to bask in the happy, easy going and entertaining atmosphere, AND IF YOU LOVE LIVE JAZZ, get your deserving self to this spot. 

I would be surprised if you didn&apos;t love at least one of my top three reasons this place is divine. Ps. I didn&apos;t go into their amazing beer and cider options their constant rotating phenomenal deserts and salads and soup specials that make you actually want soup and salad because it&apos;s that good. Their is so much more to love and obsess over with this spot but I encourage you to go find out your favorite parts if you fall hard like I did! 

Cheers!","Here&apos;s a story about service my girlfriend and I received this afternoon. We went in to order food and a beer. Everything was completely normal until the waiter walked over and asked if we knew what we wanted. My girlfriend ordered one item from the specials board, and the waiter said that the specials on the board were not available.

None of this is that noteworthy, except that I didn&apos;t hear him say that all of the specials on the board were gone. I thought he had told my girlfriend that the one item on the board was gone, not all of them. So, God forgive me, I ordered another item on the specials menu.

The waiter looked at me and said, &quot;Like I said, none of the specials are available.&quot;

I apologized, but before I could finish ordering something different, he cut me off and said he&apos;d be back with our drinks in a minute.

10 minutes went by as he floated around us helping other people, and I was a little grossed out by the previous interaction, so we decided to leave before our drinks came. I would have told the guy to cancel the order if he had paid any attention to us in that time span.

We left the bar, walked down the street to another restaurant. Dude FOLLOWS US down the street, barges in the restaurant that we are already being seated at, and shouts &quot;So, I guess you want me to cancel the beers?&quot; And storms out before I can reply.

Legendary bad service. I won&apos;t subject myself to it again.",I was just there standing outside at five minutes after they are supposed to be open and the door was locked and the woman that was working looked up at me and then started looking at her phone like I wasn&apos;t there. Kinda disappointing it was pretty cold. Just wanted a couple beers before my appointment. I&apos;ll pass on this place,"A classic, relaxed pub with better than expected pub food. Don&apos;t skip the street corn, and the duck sandwich is tasty as heck! 

The ambience is great under a Seattle sunset. The beer list is local but should have something for everyone (especially lovers of sours and goses). Don&apos;t miss out on Latona&apos;s chill!","Went once to meet some friends from out of town. Weird and rude waiter. Got mad when I touched a chair from another table to move it to our table. Made me sit in a small, uncomfortable folding chair. Proceeded to stare me down from a corner. Very uncomfortable, didn&apos;t want to order anything.","Excellent place with nice drinks and live jazz on Fridays, not a huge band, just a trio, but there energy is good. Upstairs seating is where I&apos;ve sat both times. Mushroom burger is tasty too",Good place for getting a beer! Good price also. The server was nice and the place is cozy,"I have literally never had worse service than I did tonight at the Latona pub. I went in and was seated at the bar and the bartender asked if I needed anything. I asked to see a menu. 

After giving me the menu the bartender went and made drinks and chatted with some dudes for 20 minutes while me and two others near me were completely ignored. I tried to get her attention and she said &quot;hold on&quot; and then ignored me (and others near me!) for another five minutes. I finally gave up and left.","My family rented a house just up the street for the Thanksgiving holiday.  I had read the reviews that said they did not allow kids which is unfortunate but I respect and understand the policy.

So since we couldn&apos;t eat in I got takeout for my family and had a nice easy drinking pale while I waited.  The food (kale salad, chicken sandwich, Mac &amp; cheese for kids) were all outstanding.

A great neighborhood spot.","Only 21+...i didn&apos;t get far enough down in the reviews to read that. I did look at their website beforehand and it doesn&apos;t say that. Maybe publicizing that a little better would be good. We were on family vacation, and coming from the zoo. The lady met us at the door and was super nice, but yeah.","Ordered the Xmas eve special takeout dinner. It was perfect - bring home and heat it up. The seafood boil was delicious and the pork loin yummy. I think my favorites were the Brussels sprouts, Caesar salad, and the brownie. It was well worth it and I would definitely do again post Covid-19!","I went over Valentine&apos;s Day with a reservation. Finding parking may be difficult so make sure you get there a little earlier than you expected since you may need to parallel park in the neighborhoods nearby. The servers and host were nice and welcoming. They consistently took care of us (water refills) and checked-in with us. The service was also pretty quick (especially because it was Valentine&apos;s Day!). 

We ordered their happy hour items: oysters, fried chicken, tacos. The oysters were smaller than expected (in comparison to others that I&apos;ve had), but were well complimented with their house champagne sauce. The fried chicken was not good, overpowering lemon flavor that was aimlessly slathered on the chicken (looked like it was dipped in a paint bucket). The tacos were good, but had a lot of fluid so they dripped easily (be careful when eating them). The presentation of the oysters and tacos were good.

We ordered the lamb burger and mussels dishes for the main courses. The lamb burger was medium (a little over), well constructed, and had good flavors. The burger had no overpowering flavors, it was well balanced, and didn&apos;t collapse as you ate it. The mussels were tasty and came with a side of bread that were very hard/crispy so I wasn&apos;t sure if it was meant to be dipped in the shallow mussel broth or what since the bread was like a rock. The mussels flavoring was good and there was a good amount of them in the dish. The broth was very shallow though, I would&apos;ve appreciated more especially if the bread was meant to &quot;dip&quot; into it. 

Overall, might come back, but not something on the suggestion list.","We met some friends here for dinner last night. We had a reservation but it wasn&apos;t too busy so I&apos;m not sure we would have needed it. The restaurant was a little noisy, but not too bad. We were also allowed to sit at the table long after we finished eating without feeling like we were going to be rushed out. 

The food: we ordered half a dozen oysters, the fries, and the lobster rolls. The oysters were delicious and well shucked. They also arrive on a block of ice, which my husband thought was amazing. The order of fries was a full plate, so if you&apos;re hesitant about paying $6 for fries, don&apos;t worry, you get a gigantic portion. The lobster rolls were very good, however kind of small. My husband loved them though. We also had the banana split for dessert. The almond ice cream was the best! 

The service: it was great. Very attentive and helpful. She had meal suggestions and also helped us determine how many plates to order. 

All in all, a great dinner and we&apos;d definitely return!","Was in the area to check out the cherry blossoms at UW, and decided to come here with my family for Sunday brunch. We didn&apos;t have reservations, but I was able to call ahead to check out the wait time. There was none, so we parked and hopped right in for fancy southern comfort food.

LOCATION

It&apos;s a modern restaurant with some rustic charm - there are 2 dining areas. One has booths and tables to sit in, while the other side is more like a parlor with lounge chairs and bistro tables. It might be a little difficult to come here with large groups if you don&apos;t have a reservation handy.

Street parking only, which is a pain in this area. We were able to find some parking a few blocks up, but plan ahead as street parking is a little sparse during the day.

FOOD

Oyster Po Boy: I was already familiar with their fried oysters from happy hour, so I knew this would be good. They have REALLY good fried oysters, and that was reflected in this po boy. The roasted tomatoes gave it a nice sweetness that went with the remoulade. I wish the bread was a little softer on the inside as it did make it difficult to bite into. Salad was a nice break, better than french fries IMO.

Chicken and Waffles: This dish is hit or miss, but this was definitely a hit. One of the better chicken and waffles in the area, it&apos;s simple comfort food. The waffles are crisp and sweet - they don&apos;t get super soggy under the maple syrup. The fried chicken was also good, crispy and moist but flavorful enough to compliment the waffles.

Brisket Hash: This is comparable to a fancy steak and eggs with a side of potatoes. The brisket was very tender and flavorful, it really carried the dish with the poached eggs. Served with a side of wheat toast (you get to pick), I think this was a pretty balanced dish. I wish there was a little more brisket though...

VALUE

Coming from the Bay Area, I&apos;m used to paying $15+ for an entree... especially for brunch. I think for the quality it was worth. Portions might be a little smaller, but we were satisfied with our meal.

OVERALL

Frank&apos;s Oyster House is a fantastic brunch option if you&apos;re in the area. It&apos;s close the University of Washington, so if you&apos;re visiting I&apos;d recommend checking this place out for brunch or even happy hour.

I&apos;ve been a fan of Frank&apos;s since college, and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re still around. I used to come here as a college student for late night happy hour in the parlor - when you&apos;re a broke engineering student spending late hours in lab, sometimes your only options for dinner is late night happy hour. It&apos;s been years, but their HH food was really good back then... I imagine it&apos;s still the same!","We liked Frank&apos;s and plan to come back again.

White Cheddar Biscuits: I really enjoyed the biscuits (hubby thought they were just okay).  I will say, though, that I felt the ham was sort of unnecessary.  If I order this again, I will probably eat the biscuit and apple butter without the ham, and then just eat the ham slices separately.

Persimmon Salad: (This item is not shown on the menu which appears on the website.)  Hubby ordered this, and he loved it; said he&apos;ll get it again next time.  I liked it too, except that I would ask for extra dressing because the salad greens they use aren&apos;t my favorite (I prefer really mild salad greens).

Bibb Lettuce Wedge Salad: This has a lot of promise, but if I had my druthers, I would make some changes to this dish.  The menu says it has Green Goddess dressing, which I was looking forward to because you so rarely see that anymore.  But the dressing did not seem at all like Green Goddess to me.  It seemed a lot more like Ranch.  Also, it seems like it was made with yogurt (maybe even lowfat yogurt), which was only okay; I would&apos;ve preferred it if it had been made with mayo or sour cream.  Also, the bacon was cut into big fat cubes, it was served cold so it was quite hard and chewy, and it was pretty salty, so getting a big hunk like that was overpoweringly salty and tough to chew.  I would serve the salad with somewhat smaller cubes of bacon that are still warm -- soft and unctuous -- which would be a nice counterpoint to the cold crisp lettuce, dressing and radish.

Cornmeal-Fried Oysters: The oysters and the aioli were delicious.  The oysters were properly seasoned (one of my pet peeves is underseasoned dishes coming out of restaurant kitchens).  The crust was nice and crispy, but not laid on too thick, and not at all oily.  The oysters were plump and delicious.  I would get this again for sure.  I wasn&apos;t a fan of the coleslaw or the pickles, but to be fair, I&apos;m not much of a fan of coleslaw or pickles in the first place, so I ordered the dish knowing I probably wouldn&apos;t like those items.  I will say that the pickles seemed excessively vinegary, even for a pickle.

Chicken and Waffles: Hubby ordered this and loved it.  The waffles were exceptional (Belgian style: fluffy, with a really crispy crust), and the bourbon maple syrup was terrific.  The foie gras butter was the thing that sold him on this dish when he read it on the menu.  And the flavor of the butter itself was indeed exceptional, but... unfortunately, the flavor of foie gras was barely discernible, even when tasting the butter alone.  Still, the combination of the waffle, butter and syrup was divine.  The fried chicken was very good: crispy crust without being greasy, and meat that was moist, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. 

Mock Thai Tai: Hubs ordered this, and loved it.  I did too.  This would be particularly good on a hot summer day.

Bottom line: although some of these dishes weren&apos;t perfect, they were very good overall and very enjoyable.  Enough so that we plan to return so we can try out the other menu items that sounded appealing.  We also plan to check out their sister restaurant, Pair.

The place is very small, so reservations would probably be advisable on busier nights.  We were there on a Tuesday, so we lucked out, getting seated right away without a reservation.","Went to Frank&apos;s for breakfast a weekend or two ago. My quick summary would be good, not great, due to portion sizes. You don&apos;t get much food and it&apos;s pretty expensive. 

My biggest issue has to do with chicken and waffles, which is what I ordered. I ordered chicken and waffles, plural, for $15. For $15 I think you should get about 3 waffles, considering they cost about 50 cents to make. Here you get one. One small waffle. I do not like it when places do this. Either add waffles or make it less expensive please. Also there wasn&apos;t that much chicken. The chicken and waffle (not plural) that I received were good, and came with a good butter and hot maple syrup, but I was just not impressed by the size and cost of what I got.","Excellent service. Great food. 

Delightful owner.  She also owns &quot;Pair&quot; which is walking distance right up the street. 

Plethora of oyster choices. Served on a beautiful block of ice. 
Bottle of Champagne. 
Lobster rolls!!!! (Seriously). The rolls are smallish but divine and absolutely super fresh. I grew up on the East Coast and have eaten many, many, lobster rolls. These are excellent and somebody in the kitchen knows what they are doing. 

Frank&apos;s offers a modern, elegant, comfortable dinner environment. 

I will absolutely go here more often. Casual and very cool.","I came here for dinner with a friend on a Tuesday evening around 6:30pm. It was only a 5 minute wait to be seated in the dining area. There were a few available seats in the bar/lounge area. I tried oysters on the shell (one of each type), along with a glass of champagne and the ahi poke small plate. My friend tried the NY strip (steak). We split the chocolate whiskey cake. I especially loved the champagne, cake and oysters. Good service and a good time here. Food took a bit of time to come out but I didn&apos;t mind much due to having good company. Don&apos;t come in starving! Don&apos;t park in the gravel lot next to the restaurant FYI-it belongs to the Volvo dealership across the street.","I ordered the Chicken and Waffles for take out tonight. I got home excited to eat and opened the box to find 2 small pieces of chicken included. I was so shocked, I got out my kitchen scale and weighed the pieces. 3.15oz of chicken, and after taking a couple bites, most of that was the breading. Initially, it tasted pretty good, but then there were some burnt bits and the after taste was of old fryer oil. The waffle was fine, nothing special - same as any home made waffle maker can make, but I wasn&apos;t expecting the waffle to be mind blowing or anything. The bourbon maple syryp was pretty delicious. I ate the whole entree and was left hungry. Nothing that should ever happen especially at this price point. I have had alot of chicken and waffles in my days and this one goes straight to the bottom of the list. Won&apos;t return to Frank&apos;s anytime soon.","My friend is a HUGE oyster fanatic, so I decided to treat her here for some HH oysters. We did the chefs choice &amp; got some really briney Canadian oysters for $2 a pop. My friend did not enjoy. She also got a Bloody Mary, but thought it lacked sustenance. 

Service was nice, but we prob wont be back",Simple but tasty fried chicken and waffles. Pretty quiet for a Saturday for lunch which was nice. Good service. I&apos;m not an oyster person but would come again for the waffles and chicken.,"I liked this place for its quiet atmosphere, the nice European, classic food they serve, the very good wine list and the excellent service.
I particularly liked the seafood I tasted last time, accompanied with some Austrian wine. Nice place!","First time at Frank&apos;s. Found street parking about a block away on sat eve. Had reservations and got seated promptly. Near a table of ladies having a lovely LOUD time. Sound bounces and reverberates in this place. I wore earplugs, my husband just cringed. Oysters were good. Salads ok, beet better than iceberg with weird hunks of pork belly. Quite small for 12-14 bucks. Asked for bread, got couple of end cuts of tasty bread. Ling Cod was small, hot (love hot food that comes hot) but really salty and slightly overcooked. And small. $30. Still hungry. 140 bucks (3 glasses wine, 1 entree, dozen oysters)","Brunch brunch brunch!!! Brunch is the word!! 

Give me oysters! And give me champagne!! That is all. 

I&apos;ve been here for dinner before but brunch was always on my mind. And it is out of the way from where I live: not really but Lake union! Took a plunge and went for it! Bottomless mimosa brunch that is!! 

The space is cute and rustic on one side! Not cute but stylish on one side! I like the rustic side!! And of course: I made sure they can do the bottomless mimosa with juice on the side before I showed up! 

So they did!! Grapefruit juice on the side! It was pretty good! And the chicken and waffle is a must for drinking food!! It was pretty simple and not a busy dish! Good chicken! Small size waffles! I shared most of mine but it was good! Waffles were a little too soggy for my taste and the chicken was pretty salty!!! Went well with champagne though!! 

Mellow place!! Bottomless mimosa!! Worth trekking this way out!!","Stumbled on this cute lil spot when I was looking for oysters bar near the Udistrict! I was about to make the trek out to Taylor Shellfish, but once I found this place on yelp I was intrigued. 

Ordered:
- 10 oysters (random - ended up with Seacow) + a delicious champagne-vinegar mignonette
- oyster po boy

Overall, very satisfied with what I got! The oysters came out on two long slabs of ice on wood planks, which was very cute and creative! The po boy&apos;s oysters were fried perfectly and I would definitely get it again! Thanks for the cute spot - I will definitely be back!","If your an oyster lover come check this place out!

North of University Village you don&apos;t have to worry about parking and shopping foot traffic here.

Frank&apos;s offers a happy hour until 6:30 with a nice variety of bites. We ordered 2 dozen of the chefs choice oysters on the half shell, poutine, char sui pork belly, house made potato chips, and the oyster po&apos;boy baby sliders! That&apos;s just off of their happy hour menu.

We also ordered off of the menu the red Thai curry steamed clams, Mac &amp; Cheese, and the Bibb wedge salad as well.

Service, portion size, and flavors were spot on. I&apos;ll be back for another round!","Ehhh, nice place, very slow service, no check backs, wasn&apos;t busy. Food was very tasty. Portions are small. Ambiance was excellent but $210. Dinner for four when two didn&apos;t drink anything and you feel like you need to go get. Burger afterward. Probably won&apos;t be back.","This is a really nice place to grab some great cocktails.
I&apos;ve been here a few times for brunch. I liked everything I have tried here, especially the French toast and huevos rancheros.  I also love the fried chicken! 

It gets busy over the weekend, but it&apos;s easy to find seating for a mid week cocktail or dinner.",I&apos;m not a huge shellfish fan but I throughly enjoyed the evening dining at Frank&apos;s with friends and we were all thrilled by Frank&apos;s offerings.  I was especially excited by Frank&apos;s oysters: the setup and presentation were amazing! The oyster were presented on an ice brick with a flavorful mignonette. I also enjoyed the seared Alaskan halibut entree. The atmosphere was chill and un-pretentious and we had plenty of time to enjoy our experience.,"Pros: great ambiance and a solid place for drinks and small bites. With a $1.50 oyster on the half shell happy hour it&apos;s hard to pass up. Other notables include the shrimp and grits and believe it or not, the popcorn. Yes... the popcorn is a must get as it is topped with pancetta and chives. A perfect snack to go with their drink menu.

Cons: the steak with cauliflower was a bit lack luster. I wish it was seasoned just a bit more and the cauliflower was a bit greasy. I think the cheese curdled and it made for a weird texture. The poutine was also a little under seasoned in my opinion and didn&apos;t have that ooey gooey thing that other places seem to go for. That&apos;s all my personal poutine opinion though. 

Overall I nice spot to stop in for drinks and snacks.","Went to meet a friend for drinks after work. The outside is a bit odd, but the inside is your typical neighborhood bar. I would say it&apos;s a dive bar, except that it&apos;s so clean. It&apos;s so much bigger inside than what you&apos;d expect from how it looks from the outside. Yes, insert Tardis jokes here. Had a couple of draughts and shared an order of piping hot fries. My friend didn&apos;t like that it came with some tartar sauce.

The bartender was very accommodating. I asked if they had a radler and she looked at me puzzled, but not pissed. It was a hot day, what can I say? I keep learning the same &quot;bar&quot; lesson over and over again. Order your drinks based on where you&apos;re at, e.g. order a local pint in a small Frankfurt neighborhood, not the scotch. You&apos;ll get along better with the locals.","My wife grew up in Ballard and has fond memories of dining at a restaurant called Blazes Broiler so she was  excited to discover that the Wedgewood Broiler is owned by the same family.  I took her there for her birthday two years ago and she absolutely loved it.  The menu and the decor reminded her of Blazes Broiler in the 1970&apos;s and the food was good but rather expensive.  We went back for her birthday this year and we were extremely disappointed.  The service was slow, the salads were a wet blob of wilted lettuce and no one in our party of four was happy with their meal.  My wife&apos;s teriyaki steak was overcooked her friends NY steak was undercooked my buddy and I ordered prime rib that was cooked correctly but it was barely warm when we got it.  What I hoped would be a fun walk down memory lane ended up being an expensive lesson in &quot;you can&apos;t go back&quot;.","After many visits to Wedgwood Broiler (used to be a nearby Ravenna resident), unfortunately it led to a very bad experience back in June 2017. A total face palm culinary moment. Fast forward over two years...

Called ahead to see if there was any prime rib left on 8/31/19 since it was well after 8pm. This is only served on Fridays through Sundays. There was availability, so I dragged The Homie with me for a late dinner. 

We were seated with no problem, but then it took awhile to get our order in, to receive our order, and then just had to get up and pay for our bill up at the front cash register area. In the meantime, there were some misfires and also having to be seated next to two men with overheard outbursts like &apos;disingenuous rabbis&apos;. Doesn&apos;t that sound like a band name? Total non sequiteur, but that was how this late night dinner was going.

Backtracking to actual food feedback:

Hmmm never got any dinner rolls.

Strawberry milkshake ($5.25) tasty, but could have bought a gallon of Tillamook ice cream instead.

The salad was overdressed but I ate it because of hunger. Probably should have stopped there. 

The clam chowder was deemed good by The Homie. The crackers were ignored.

The prime rib entrees (Wedgwood cut, 11 oz, $25.50 each) were a *major* disappointment. We both requested medium rare to rare, but after a lengthy wait, received medium well with a lot of fat to trim away. Lame au jus and no horseradish. The veggies (sad bagged baby carrots) were overcooked, potatoes (baked and mashed) were just okay.

Waited a long time, would have ordered dessert, but no water refills, and it seemed our wait person disappeared. After 30 minutes, we were done eating, we gave up and walked to the front cash register to settle our bill.

With tax and tip, this lackluster meal cost $73.93. Could have eaten better at JuneBaby in Ravenna or a received a tableful of tasty goodness with takeout boxes in the International District. Just a bunch of sophomoric giggles from the wait person. No apologies, no explanations provided. Lame. I work hard for my paycheck and too bad this is no longer a Seattle indie I can rely on like in years past. 

The June 2017 and this 8/31/19 visit pretty much seals the deal. 

No future return. Such a bummer after a long run of awesomeness. Definitely not recommended anymore. Maybe this site should become condos. Enough said.","I would try to make excuses, like perhaps it was the chefs night off or perhaps they were too busy during dinner rush... but this was a Saturday before 6pm.

The sauteed mushrooms which we had paid extra for on my veggie burger had been given just the briefest of introductions to the saute pan before being given its seat of ignomony on top of the patty and still had the texture of raw mushrooms.

The garden salad must have been made by a chef who has salami and cheezit bushes, because that was the garnish. Which might have been okay, but im vegetarian, and chose garden salad for just that reason. 

My wifes steak was supposed to be medium, but came fatty and rare. Our dog was the only happy customer, because she ended up getting half the steak. 

Do. Not. Eat. Here.","We come to Seattle for my husbands cancer treatment every 3 weeks and our room at SCCA House only has a microwave for cooking. A friend recommended we try it for dinner.

Hands down the best Chicken Fried Steak I have ever eaten. The steak was  fork tender but the crunchy crust was amazing and the gravy thick and flavorful.
The baked potato came with soft butter, sour cream and chives and the veggies were crisp tender.

When they realized we were out in our car eating and didn&apos;t take it home they came out brought us utensils and asked to open my bottle of rootbeer.

If you are in Seattle, visit Seattle or have appointments at SCCA and stay at SCCA House, this is worth the drive.","The WB is like your own private clubhouse!

I&apos;ve been coming here for about 2 decades now, and it always feels like home.  There is nothing better than drinking in a dark, wood-paneled bar (on a sunny day), especially if the place also has really good food.  And this is THE place!

Okay, so I&apos;m not as regular as my friend Frank (who can be found in the bar as often as 2 or 3 nights during a week), but I do make it in about once a month. Wendy and Carol always take good care of us. I love the sassy wit of these two super-star servers.  That Erin is a keeper, too.

The food is all high-quality, and you&apos;ll love the selection of traditional broiler house favorites.  Steaks, prime rib, london broil, patty-melts, burgers, a great Caesar, or even their classic house salad topped with salami and Cheez-its are all sure to please.

Special order? No problem! You can get just about anything you want, as long as the house has the ingredients and the kitchen isn&apos;t slammed. The staff will give you the straight 411 and an honest ETA for your meal.  

Here is my current favorite: Guacamole burger with chicken (not beef), no bun, extra-crispy hashbrowns (instead of fries) served with baked potato toppings on the side, plus a side of mushrooms, and an order of onion rings to start.  I&apos;ll wash all that down with a few pints of Lagunitas.

Get to the bar early (or go with Frank) for the best service. I&apos;ll look for you in there tomorrow afternoon for Happy Hour!

Post scriptum: Gents should check out that Harvey the Rabbit artwork in the main MR. It&apos;s been a customer classic for more than a decade.","Ehhhhhh.  I could give a 5 Star for the wings.. and I could give a 1 Star for the service. Both of those ratings have been absolutely consistent the gazillion times I have eaten here. If this place is 3 stars then why do I go back? It is probably because it is close and easy. 

Serious lesson needed for their service staff regarding overall service (this does not include any of the men I have met here). Not sure why but the ladies that service the tables are just kinda not doing it for me with their cranky manner.  Hey.. ladies...I worked in a bunch of bars and restaurants too.. your job is NOT easy but holy hell lighten up and learn to at minimum fake a smile. Each time I go here.. be it the bar side or the restaurant side...the waitresses suck specific to their disposition.  I&apos;m polite. I&apos;m not high maintenance. Oh.. and yes I have money and I tip but you continue to be pretty snotty. Put the sword down and be pleasant to your female customers. Praying that you turn the page and learn to smile and perhaps just be more courteous to ALL of your customers and not just the men.","Party like it&apos;s 1965! That&apos;s the gist of the article in Seattle Times or some other local rag. 

You HAVE to stop here once if in Bellevue. The prices are very low. Bulleit is 8 dollars! Specialty cocktails so cheap. Double Manhattan was like 9 and it was yuuugge. 

Service is friendly and you really do feel like you stepped back in time a half-century or so. 

There are no busboys so the servers are terribly overworked. But they are so nice. They have every reason to be unpleasant but they just smile and work their butts off for you. 

The &quot;shrimp cocktail&quot; is cheap but it&apos;s not prawns. Just baby bay shrimp. The prime rib is fine. Not fantastic but it is decent and for the price you can&apos;t complain. 

The only thing like it I know is The Tee Off in Santa Barbara, which features a neon sign in the shape of a martini and above it: &quot;Air conditioned.&quot; 

The sundaes are cheap and great. 

My baked potato was loaded and delicious.","Yikes, my brother in law picked this place to celebrate his wife&apos;s birthday. Total waste of a meal. Medium rare steak prime rib came out almost medium well. Looked like a shoe and tasted like it. 

Service is half-assed - servers are busy doing their work rather than attending to the 2 tables each they had. Had to ask for the most obvious of things, forks, napkins, extra plate, refills. Exhausting! 

Kids meals are terrible - my son was miserable with his dad looking cheese burger. Really they grind their own meat?!","So here we go again and tonight we are eating dinner at the Wedgewood Broiler. I ordered the Meatloaf special and a appetizer of clams strips. This restaurant also serves bread like most every restaurants . First of all their bread is really really good, But they limit amount of bread you get and we have 3 people eating at this table. Also they didn&apos;t say either way that the bread are limited.

The clams strips are NOT worth ordering. It is like frozen clams strips and it is like that old lady said &quot; where is the beef &quot; and so where are them clams ??? Not good for the price of $7.00 cause Ivan&apos;s is even better. 

My dinner was the meat loaf. From the look of the meat loaf it looks like liver, but it was really good. I love extra gravy and this place charges extra anything and to me that is Not cool. Why charges fir extra gravy ??? It came with vegetables &amp; them veggies are way over cooked. Too mushy!!!!  Also the dinner comes with salad or soup and I choose the soup and it was chicken noodle. This soup was good as well. Overall this place for dinner is 2.5 out of 5 stars .","This place serves a decent cocktail for a fair price, but that&apos;s about it.  I ordered the hot turkey sandwich one time.  It came covered with some kind of congealed yellow sauce, and green beans on the side.  I put my fork in the sauce to taste it, and when I attempted to raise it to my mouth, the entire sauce came off in one big sheet.  The green beans were almost the consistency of baby food, and the entire meal was grossly over salted.  After taking a couple of bites I pushed the plate away and asked for the check.  I explained to the server that the meal was not to my liking, but she charged me anyway.  I patronized the bar for a while, but the thinly disguised contempt emanating from some of the staff finally go to me and I quit going in there.","Was around town and wanted to be seated for a good meal, saw the menus and was pretty impressed at the selection, me and my friend order the wings zings and London broil, the servers were quick to order and bring the food. Not to mention the quickness of refills in bread lolz, anyway was really impressed, deffiantly recommended, pices are cheap, will be back!","Been coming to the Wedge since the late 1990s.  Nothing has changed.  Last there over the 2019 Holiday season and had a great a great experience.  
For Seattle, the prices are more than reasonable.  The menu has oldschool Liver and Onions; something I find comfort in seeing, but never order.  
Cool booths in the bar.  Orange in color.  Great list of featured has not changed in years.   What&apos;s not to like?",A timeless classic! My family has been coming here forever . My friend and I each got the turkey dinner and two special martinis. Prices you won&apos;t find at the newer establishments in this neighborhood. Original Seattle vibes the kind of place Lost Lake on the hill tries to be but doesn&apos;t quite get it.,"I met a friend for brunch on my first visit to the Wedgwood Broiler and once I entered in the &quot;IN&quot; door, it was like stepping back in the 70s. The lighting was dim and wood paneling reigned supreme in this wonderfully vintage restaurant! Our hostess was friendly and sat us in a back booth with our menus. Our server followed shortly afterward, bringing us ice water with lemon and then coffee.

I ordered their chicken fried steak, fried eggs over medium, hash browns, and sourdough toast. I really liked that they grill the bread for their toast and the kitchen got my eggs right. The food was nicely priced and tasty. I&apos;m definitely returning for one of their waffles and some bacon. My brunch companion ordered some French toast (that was beautiful), eggs, and sausage.

I looked over their lunch/dinner menus. They grind their own beef for their hamburgers and offer Prime Rib on Fridays and the weekend until they run out. My friend said they have legit baked potatoes with all the fixings too! And if you have room for dessert after your meal, you can get floats, sundaes, cakes, homemade fruit pies, or a hand-dipped milkshake! 

There is plenty of free parking and bench seating in the foyer in case you have to wait on a table. While we were there, I learned they also have a full service bar with a happy hour menu also, if that&apos;s your jam!",Love their old school ambience in the bar and their weekend prime rib. Cheezits on the salad? Yes please,"I know I should love this place more but it was just ok for me. Four friends stopped in on a Sunday for lunch. I had a Bloody Mary to start and it was prob the most boring Bloody Mary I have had. Tasted like bland tomato juice with no spice. We shared a Prime Rib dip sandwich and it was good but just good. 

My second drink, the Mint Julep was really good and tasty. My friend couldn&apos;t stop raving about her double blue cheese salad she loved the dressing.  Our server seemed super annoyed and even rolled her eyes when my friend asked for some olives for her martini. But she seemed nicer and more attentive as the hour went on. 

This is a neighborhood stable and all my friends are totally in love with the food and this old neighborhood gem. I will go back and give it another try though and try something other then the boring Bloody Mary and Dip sandwich.",I always eat a salad with the old school topping like cheese its. Burger are made to order.food is blowback meat house of the 70s and early 80s.good stuff and huge martinis,"An evening of power outage, wifi disruption, and smartphone anxiety leaving us to turn back time and return to the community days of restaurant venturing. A classic ketchup, cheese, meat, lettuce experience calmed the nerves,silenced the grumbling critics, and moved the chains of time until the sleeping blanket aura covers the night away and resets the world back into modern ways.","Been there last Friday. Horrible salad, dressing was waaaayyy too sweet. Pulled chicken sandwich was ok-ish but everything was just super greasy. Kids fish was the only thing that looked very good. Kids Hot dog looked ok-ish. But the signature dish, the prime rib was awful. Meat and fries were almost cold. Meat looked like it had been boiled. Nothing attractive about this at all. Veggies were canned or have just been cooked the life out of, almost grey-ish. Place was dated, dirty and what&apos;s up with the Christmas decor? The high chair was so dirty, you could feel the dirt caked on. The prime rib was sent back, chicken sandwich partly eaten, we&apos;re never coming back. Call me crazy but I like to eat well prepared meals in a clean environment.","There aren&apos;t many vegetarian restaurants around town that have local roots as deep as Sunlight. That was one of the initial draws for me coming here. I&apos;d heard and read a few other good vegetarian spots that have come and gone years ago but this place has been in the same neighborhood since the 1970&apos;s!

I initially stopped by on occasion in their former spot 1 block over on Roosevelt. That location was comfy &amp; cozy but felt rather stuffy and had just enough wear and tear to nudge the owners to relocate to the current new, spacious and modern space.

This space is really great. Along with the spacious airy vibe, they kept some of the original color aesthetic from their old location and overall &quot;sunlight&quot; atmosphere (which also happens to get natural westerly sunlight facing west with large windows); yellow, white, dark red, sky blue - even the restroom sinks have beautiful designs. Last summer, I&apos;d hoped they&apos;d add shade screens because it can be too bright. Rotating artwork downstairs and upstairs balcony.

The staff has been super chill, friendly and patient whenever I dish up menu questions as I can be a super conscious consumer. One of the owners (Sheryl?) often recognizes me and expressed gratitude for my patronage. She is very nice and homey.

Now on to the food! I&apos;ve probably had 1/3 of the offerings here that are vegan and/or can be prepared vegan. I really appreciate the labeling details and decent organic usage. Everything tends to taste fresh and healthy; some exceptions for me would probably be the potatoes, tofu and tempeh because they often feel &quot;heavy&quot; to me being fried/grilled/sauteed in just a bit too much oil (greasy texture). The highlander is good, the lemon poppy seed waffle is nice (good toppings; the blueberry compote is not bad - tastes canned) with a neat thin crunchy texture, the tofu cheesecakes are quite good, maple cashew cookie, the former kitchen cookie (it used to be vegan, now just vegetarian/vegan with honey), the house whole wheat bread toasted is cool (great with guac and all herbs available like cilantro &amp; parsley), rice salads... I think my current fav item is the steamed veggie &amp; tofu dish with garlic ginger sauce with sprinkled black pepper added. So clean, so fresh, so good.

*** This review was written during the local COVID-19 Advisory when many restaurants were limiting operations. Contact the business to verify operational changes ***","I loved this place! It&apos;s so rare to find a restaurant with tasty and healthy food that can flexibly accommodate vegan, vegetarian, and other cuisine all at once. The staff were very nice and there&apos;s a ton of space indoors and some seating outdoors too. The lemon seed waffles were insanely good, possibly the best waffles I&apos;ve ever had, the smoothies were both rich in flavor, and the Epicurean breakfast was fulfilling and obviously contained very fresh products. I highly recommend the Sunlight Cafe and look forward to returning soon!",Classic vegetarian and vegan bakery and cafe. We enjoyed GF cookies and blueberry pie. My favorite was the Banana cake with cc frosting. Sunday Brunch time and the smells were delicious coming from the grill. Ps I saw them refilling the cold items on the line and the produce looked so so fresh.,"Large blushing lettuce salad with herbal vinaigrette, a side order of tempeh, and yogi tea with soymilk are my go-to! Obsessed with their dressings, desserts, and tempeh! The staff is always friendly. Clean place.",I went this morning around 10:30 and the restaurant seemed to be in shambles. I had put my name on the list but I waited 45 minutes outside in the rain just to be seated outside without heaters. The staff seamed overwhelmed and unorganized which made my near dining experience more stressful. I waited at least 20 minutes for a server to acknowledge that I was waiting for my order to be taken and then another 10 for it to actually be written down. After waiting even longer I still didn&apos;t get my food or my coffee which resulted in me just getting up and going somewhere else. I believe my poor experience was due to lack of good management directing staff and it seemed that they were understaffed. I would recommend coming here on a weekday instead of a weekend because you&apos;re going to be waiting at least 2 hours for your food.,"What a cool spot!  Very light and open and very homey feeling.  I just came in for a coffee, but I was impressed by the ambience being so clean, and the design was modern yet very comfortable.  The wait staff was friendly and accomodating, and the coffee was excellent.  Will definitely come back to try their menu!","I came to this restaurant as a vegan in a family with me, a vegetarian, and 2 omnivores. Everyone loved the food! I ordered the vegan highlander and the vegan waffle, which were both was DELICIOUS!! Very neat space (they are currently open for dine-in). Along with a breakfast/brunch, lunch, and dinner menu, they also serve assorted desserts! I tried the vegan peanut butter chocolate cheesecake, which was pretty yummy. Totally recommend coming here!! :)","I got the falafel salad, and it was super good! I liked sitting at the bar because I got to watch the cooks. Good vegetarian and vegan options and nice location. I went to Wayward Vegan up the street, and Sunlight Cafe&apos;s food was much better. I was skeptical because I saw a 3.5 ish rating on google, but Sunlight Cafe was good. I&apos;d like to come back for waffles.","I&apos;ve been here before for brunch and the food was good. However, today I got here early right before they open at 8:30 am. I came specifically because I wanted waffles, eggs and bacon. You know pretty standard. I was told,  once I got in that the kitchen doesn&apos;t open until 9am. And that all they have are waffles. Seriously?? I didn&apos;t see that anywhere. And eggs and bacon are staples. Get your people in early if you say you&apos;re open at 8:30 am. And I know waffles take time to make but these came out really fast, which tells me they are pre-made. 

Serious disappointment. I get casual but if your staff can&apos;t be bothered to get out of bed to come in then why should your customers?","The interior is super cute and definitely fit the vibe but thats about the only positive of this place. Service was beyond horrible from the moment our group arrived. Our waitress acted like taking our order was a chore. Not only did the food take some time to arrive but my eggs were rubbery and cold. The waitress did not check in on us once and when she came to deliver our checks no boxes were offered despite everyones plates having food. All in all our dining time took about 2 hours, with the majority of that consisting of waiting. I would not recommend unless you want rude unresponsive staff and lackluster food.","I give this place props for being vegetarian with solid vegan options. I also like that they weren&apos;t concocting a lot of fake meat/cheese substitutes, but just using more veggies! 

I came here for brunch with two friends on a busy Sunday. This place is fairly large, so the wait wasn&apos;t too long despite three or four parties in front of us. We ordered a breakfast burrito, eggs &amp; salsa, and my vegan friend got the vegan highlander. The food was big! Best of all, the potatoes were so flavorful. The prices were also affordable.

I was really blown away by the politeness of the staff. They thanked us for our patience, for the initial wait and again for food being a little slow. It was totally reasonable for how busy it was, but very considerate nonetheless.","We walked in, on Saturday for brunch, had a 10 minute wait, and enjoyed every minute of our experience. Our food was great, the waitress was great, and people working there would check in on us if our waitress was busy which I think is a sign of incredible customer service.",Food is delicious! My favorite is the sesame crunch waffle with yogurt &amp; bananas and the tofu scramble with a side of their amazing tahini. My mom and I usually split,"I was open minded enough to give this a try. I even told the waiter I am just ordering one to share, so as to give the restaurant a chance to shine. So, I ordered a simple dish. A tostada! It was one puny tostada that was buried in a soup bowl. Presentation; HORRIBLE  Ok.. we thought it was a wrong order and decided to dig thru and find out. It was a tostada, but is wrong. Black bean and Romain salad- and that&apos;s $11.99. And with sour cream and guacamole, that makes it to $16! And the taste- seriously.. it was like a chinese mom trying to make Mexican food without knowing what a taco is. I am very 100X very disappointed with the food. They have the location, they just have to get the right recipe. Gosh. What a waste of my time!","I&apos;ve eaten in this place off and on for over three decades, and only once, long ago, got a terrible meal, and that was a mushy icky bean burger no longer on the menu. Breakfasts are exciting to me, particularly their waffles and their huevos racheros. 

Dinners are healthy and flavorful, but are also &quot;substantial grub!&quot; not prissy tiny portions of something that looks fancy on the plate but good thing there&apos;s only one bite of it because more would be sickening. These are real meals for hungry vegheads!  

I marvel that some of the reviews are so critical. I think some people PREFER fancy presentation over substantial grub, and are put off by the slightly arty yet working class &quot;diner&quot; atmosphere and service. Or I just don&apos;t know. To me this place has always just been a marvel.","THIS PLACE ROCKS!!! From our server to the food, all the way to the environment this place is awesome. Me and my wife came in about 2 weeks ago and are still to this day blown away by how good their food is. We are both vegan and have a super hard time finding restaurants that are dairy free and test food, But this place knocked it our the park in both!! The breakfast came out to around $50, and honestly we&apos;d go there again, and actually will be this weekend. Totally in love, and can&apos;t wait for more. Would recommend to everyone vegan and non vegan","So disappointed!! Have always wanted to try Sunlight Cafe and were in the neighborhood this morning. Unfortunately we couldn&apos;t get anyone to take our order so we opted for a friendlier place. 

We were seated outside and a waitperson came and took the order of the party sitting next to us (who were seated AFTER us) but didn&apos;t acknowledge us or ask us if we wanted coffee or tea. She did look at us but opted to walk back into the restaurant. Not sure what it was about us that was so unappealing but there are plenty of other places to take our business.","The only reason I came here is because a gf heard about it and wanted to try it. Looking online at their menu and reviews I was a bit timid to go but really wanted to see her new baby so we decided to meet there for brunch. It wasn&apos;t that busy and was able to get a table within a reasonable amount of time. 

Food is here is your typical vegetarian diner fare. Nothing amazing but its what you would expect from a basic diner. I was hoping they would have a protein side (didn&apos;t see anything and I would of been find with like tempeh or tofu) but nope. I got the pancakes and a side of potatoes. the Potatoes were a bit on the firm side and didn&apos;t finish it.

Service was meh. It sure took us a while to get our check and then for them to pick up the check. 

Next time i&apos;m going to tell her to meet me at Portage Bay around the corner and get a side of bacon.","So it&apos;s been AN HOUR since I ordered and I STILL don&apos;t have my food. I was going to wait to write a review until after I eat because maybe the food will be amazing but at this point it&apos;s too late. Apparently the waitress told me &quot;she&apos;s cooked yours wrong 3x do you want her to do it again correctly or take it incorrectly&quot; and I&apos;m like &quot;hmmm. I would like to eat how I ordered it, so she can fix it.&quot; All I didn&apos;t want... were red peppers. Confused why this is so hard and how you could mess that up 3x.

So the food was pretty good but still wouldn&apos;t wait an hour. The waitress was very kind and gave me a free apple pie slice to go for the delay. Good customers service. Still would probably not come back though, for the price and wait time not worth it.","Fast and friendly service. It was a great option for a light, healthy meal. I loved the environment and the food! I ordered a half sandwich and salad combo. The lemon tahini dressing is delicious!","I think this place has the potential for more than three stars but I will explain why that&apos;s what it came to. Every person who wants a drink has to go get it from the bar. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s that far out of bounds to say this is a bad look and bad service. I didn&apos;t see why I was tipping someone when I was doing the leg work for them. Furthermore, the wings were wildly overcooked the day we came in. Might not be normal, but they were barely edible. On a positive note. The steak sandwich pictured was very good. I would suggest hiring more wait staff and taking better care of the wings.","A nice pub with an awesome selection of new on tap local and national beers and a friendly barkeep staff. Lots of TVs are up on the walls and there are four areas to play darts  which makes this a great hang out joint. 

The food selection has your standard fair of chicken wings, rings, fries and burgers.  The sandwiches are tasty as are the burgers, but as you would expect it&apos;s classic bar food. A worthy place to hang and food that is on par with every other pub I&apos;ve been too. 

And Yes I would go back!!",I arrived into the Seattle airport after 9pm so it ended up being pretty late by the time I finished checking into my AirBNB and Cooper&apos;s Alehouse fortunately was nearby and still serving food by the time I arrived.  They were sold out of some menu items but eventually I was able to score the fish and tater tots which were definitely on point and the fish was done perfectly.  They have some of your normal mass brewed beer here but on tap it was majority craft beers and most of them were actually good craft beers as a bonus.  Overall this is a nicer dive bar with some good food and a fun vibe that is a great neighborhood spot.,"Came here for the first time over the holiday weekend after reading it on several lists of &quot;Best Chicken Wings in Seattle&quot;. 

It&apos;s a perfectly divey spot with tvs and games. 

The wings were great; so far the best we&apos;ve had since moving here! The service was great. All in all, we loved it and hope to come back asap! 

Pro Tip: Get the Tom Shanks, they&apos;re literally fried pork ribs that look like meat lollipops but taste 20x better than my description and theirs.",Great and roomy dive bar with very respectable beer selection. They have lots of TVs and games and just a chill spot to be any night.,"Seattle&apos;s original alehouse! Gotta love this place, free darts and dart leagues Mon/wed, free pool, free comedy every 3rd Thursday, free trivia tuesdays, free poker Saturday and Sunday, dollar tacos, tom shanks!, ice cream cookies!! Free board games! Atari! The staff is friendly. The CUSTOMERS are friendly! You can hear yourself talk! Dog friendly, too! 

If the BMW motorcycle dealership is closed (I believe all day Monday and after 6pm other days) you can park in their lot, which is right across the street!

No frills bar with hard to find beers on tap!","Great atmosphere, delicious fresh fried chicken and Amazing beer. Staff was very friendly as well. I would recommend this to anyone in the area looking for a relaxed fun atmosphere.","Came in and had 1 beer but my card was charged $25.  I noticed and came back a few minutes later and the bartender said that&apos;s just their system and it should get adjusted after they close out.  I&apos;ve only ever seen that at gas stations, not a restaurant, he was surprised about that.  The next day there was no adjustment yet to my bank account.  Extremely shady, never going back.","Left to our own devices in Maple Leaf, we were looking for a dining establishment close by for an easy dinner. Based on the reviews we settled on Cooper&apos;s. It a neighborhood bar. When we walked in, a rousing darts games was going on, and latter in our visit some local sports teams (soccer?) wandered in. A massive menu of local craft beers listed on the chalk board. Lots of ciders too. Menu was pub grub. Wings, burgers, sandwiches. It&apos;s dark and paneled with the perquisite beer distributor&apos;s advertising posters and homages to local sports teams. It hit the spot.","If you are in the area this place is worth a try.  It&apos;s kinda located on the Main Street with limited or maybe no parking. We uber there so couldn&apos;t tell if customer parking was available. We walked in the middle of a raffle drawing and it sounded like they were wrapping up an event. It&apos;s a decent size bar we sat at the bar area and ordered maybe 1..2..or 3 drinks ? Ok ...whose counting! Bar tender Bailey was extremely friendly and occasionally chimed into our conversation, which we appreciated. They also have a pool table and as we chatted with Bailey she mentioned they also host Trivia nites and IPA fest. We didn&apos;t try any food so my fellow yelpers you may just need to go out there do some tasting. Overall good place to hangout if you are in the area.","If you&apos;ve ever been sitting in traffic on Lake City Way while trying to get on the 5 freeway, you&apos;ve seen Coopers.

This is an awesome place to grab a drink with friends after work, shoot some pool, play some darts or take advantage of the plethora of board games that are available.

The prices are reasonable, the staff friendly.  The overall vibe is laid back and very comfortable with a good variety of people to hang with.

Parking can be a challenge. Best bet is find parking in the neighborhood around the area. We came on Friday, around 5p and had no problem.

Definitely looking forward to returning!",Great spot. Solid trivia. Chef Bryce is excellent and also a babe. Highly recommend. Ask for his number. You won&apos;t regret.,"Great spot for beer and pub grub. The wings are baked but still surprisingly crispy which is a must for me. Pool, darts, and sports on TV make it a fun place to go with a group or solo for a beer.","This was a pretty good stop for dinner. It has your typical sports bar feel to it with TVs and pool tables. 

They had a great selection of beers, many of them local. I had a great Bellingham beer. We got the onion rings for an appetizer. They were literally some of the best onion rings I had had. They were light and weren&apos;t overly heavy. 

For dinner I had the Reuben. It was pretty good. It had a lot of pastrami on it and had onions. It came with a deliciously spicy horseradish. The meal also came with fries which were very tasty. 

The meal wasn&apos;t too expensive ~$11 which is just right for pub food. Overall, it was a pretty tasty dinner.","Alas, my search for chicken wings that are worth a damn has come to an abrupt close...
Since moving to PNW a year ago, I couldn&apos;t find a place with good chicken wings to save my life. 

Coopers freakin nailed it. 

It seems like such a stupid thing to be excited for but apparently a great plate of buffalo wings is a rarity around here. 

Plus they have a killer booze selection to boot. 

Viva los wings!","Great Chill bar! Good drinks, amazing bar food- we had grilled asparagus and tater tots- both delicious! Service Good! Totally a great place to hang out!",Complete lack of fung shway.  Very VERY bright.  Uncomfortable atmosphere.  Good beer selection.  Bartenders seem to be complacent.,"This place is a great little gem! Full of great beer, board games, and good cheap food. Also a decent place to watch a sports game from. My wife and I shared the &quot;Half&quot; order of totchos, which where fantastic, and big enough for both of us to almost split as a meal.","Good food and fun. Servers are great.
Ladies room is very tight and difficult to use with any handicap.
Otherwise this is an enjoyable place.","This has easily become our go-to neighborhood bar. When we&apos;re interested in going out for a chill night, Cooper&apos;s is the place to be. They have pool, darts, board games, TVs, booze, and trivia nights on Tuesdays. Who could ask for more?

Their food is pretty good: chicken strips, BLT, Philly cheese steak, etc. The whole she bang! The bartenders and servers are nice too.

Tip: Order food at the bar instead of the table, they&apos;ll bring the food to you though.","One of the only places in the area open on new year&apos;s day! We went for breakfast and tried  Huevos a la Mexicana and buttermilk biscuit and gravy.

Huevos a la Mexicana was delicious! Basically scrambled egg with veggies and lovely Mexican spices. Comes with delicious potatoes and corn totillas. I normally don&apos;t eat totillas, but these were sooo tasty and light at the same time!

Biscuit and gravy was fine. Be sure to add eggs and chorizo. The chorizo is amazing! Fresh with the right mix of spices! 

The lady was really nice and friendly. They are take out only for the time being. Definitely recommend giving this place a try. Great take out option during covid!","I bypassed by here all the time and always saw a good crowd of people here for brunch (pre-covid tim) and finally decided to come in this summer when the indoor dinning was allowed.
The atmosphere is rather cozy and friendly, the restaurant follows pretty strict covid guideline which made me feel very safe. The menu was pretty extensive and we had chicken waffle and veggie egg whites omelette. Both dishes came out great, my boy friend was impressed with the chicken waffle and I was really happy with my egg white omelette.","One of my first pick-up experiences during the Covid crisis and here&apos;s how it went.
Perfectly.
Sarah Jo was SO nice and easy to work with - I had lots of questions about the menu and she patiently answered all of them, even gave me recommendations when asked.  I also had several friends order from there so we could minimize everyone&apos;s exposure, and even though some of them called in their orders last-minute, all of the food was hot and ready for me to pick up.  I felt very good about their safety protocols, lots of hand sanitzer, gloves, etc.  But on to the best part - the food.
My family ordered a lot of food so that we&apos;d have some leftover for the next day.  Ha!  Oh, wait, now I see why they are called Ha!  Because the joke is on you if you think you won&apos;t eat every morsel.  The burgers were great, the fries outrageous, the crab melt has my mouth watering just thinking about it.","Comfort food with a small town vibe. Got lunch here which was a happy surprise. Everything from the customers to the service felt very homey. It seems like everything they make is fresh and come in huge portions. Definitely get the dive bar feel to it as well and had great music! Classic rock jams made me feel right at home.

My friend and I ordered the crab grilled cheese with fries and salad sides. The Dungeness crab melt was so cheesey, ooey, and gooey. So good. It had a little kick to it - pimento cheese, which is always an added plus with grilled cheese-esque sammies. The truffle fries were missing the truffle taste though, was really looking forward to it. The salad was refreshing and not wilted at all. Ha! is a fun place and is perfect for its comfort food feels","Grabbed lunch here and it was a great experience. I had one of their chicken pot pies and it came with a nice salad. Their mix of bar/diner food and Mexican food seemed weird at first but I think it&apos;s pretty good. 

The service was great and the bartender was really friendly. Parking in the area is good and I had no trouble during a normal week day. Lots of great options in the area but this is certainly worth coming to.","Really solid comfort food. The grilled focaccia that comes with the wings would be enough to be worth a meal there by itself. The crab melt is delicious, hearty and worth every penny. Can&apos;t wait to eat there again.","We have been here many times and it&apos;s always been great. Tasty, Fast and great service. Last time we went we had one of those &apos;oh crap we didn&apos;t look at the time right&apos; and we had to leave. The staff was super accommodating and we really appreciated. We will continue to come",Stumbled upon this little gem on accident. It was sooo yummy! The mimosas are on point! The eggs Benedict was one of the best I&apos;ve had and I always order when I&apos;m traveling or doing a fun weekend breakfast. Definitely and must try. If we lived here we&apos;d be regulars.,"Burned my leg on their heating vent that is under the window seat. When I told the server she offered me ice but seemed totally unapologetic. No comped drink or attempt to actually cover/guard the burning hot grate. We always had to flag her down for service and she was out smoking the other half of the time. Just unprofessional in my opinion. Tainted the night. I also asked for coffee and she said they didn&apos;t have any, what?! I&apos;m pretty sure she just didn&apos;t want to make it. Piss poor service, especially to someone who just injured themselves in your establishment.","I popped in for a quick lunch after visiting Eyes on Fremont. I had the arugula  beet salad with cranberries, Gorgonzola, and walnuts. For and $3 they added a grilled chicken breast which was very flavorful. The salad was a generous portion and fresh. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the tomato basil soup needed to be strained as is was Tiberius from the basil. (Tasted great)","Ha! is a super fun place.  The bartenders/servers are always fun and friendly.  The food is really good and I enjoyed everything I had.  They made an amazing vegan burrito here!!  There are also other vegan options, but I didn&apos;t try any other food other than the burrito and the hummus plate (which was also good).  The drinks are always nice.  They usually have a &quot;sangria of the day&quot; and the options I&apos;ve had are amazing.  It&apos;s a great atmosphere and I always have a great time whenever I&apos;m there and every time I every come to Seattle I make it a point to stop into Ha! several times!","Delicious dinner, awesome drinks, great service, best music I&apos;ve heard in a restaurant so far while in Seattle. If we lived here this would be a regular spot for us.","PSA 1: They have chicken and waffles here
PSA 2: The chicken and waffles are not great

We found this place and came because my husband was craving chicken and waffles and was looking for a place nearby that served it (oddly hard to find online around Phinney Ridge). Ha! is a cute, colorful little place with plenty of brunch options. It was quiet when we came around lunch time on a Saturday. The bar area was oddly packed but the chatty, singing bunch there enhanced the light atmosphere. 

Obviously, we ordered chicken + waffles, as well as steak + eggs. The breading on the fried chicken was not crispy and was not seasoned well. Fried chicken skin is usually booomb but this one was not. The waffles also tasted like they came from a boxed mix. The entree came with a small portion of sausage gravy which was a nice touch. Overall not a great plate of chicken + waffles but not bad enough to leave a craving unsatisfied! The steak was over cooked (asked for medium rare and got well done) but everything else on the plate was standard and tasty (eggs, toast, potatoes). I had no expectations coming in here and I was not disappointed.","My boyfriend and I stopped by to place a to-go order a few weeks back and we didn&apos;t even get as far as ordering! The place was empty- but yes it was open, and we had to work to get someone&apos;s attention. Once we did and asked to place an order, she gave us a rude disapproving grunt and didn&apos;t even offer a menu. 

We walked out and will never be back.","This place is alright. Let&apos;s just say, I would never recommend it to anyone. It should just be a bar with maybe 5 things on the menu. The drinks are all pretty good, they&apos;re fine. Every time I&apos;ve been here, the servers were super rude for no reason. They never have anything figured out (cook hasn&apos;t shown up yet, out of random, simple things, etc.) I&apos;ve had a few things to eat here that were good, ribs and nachos. The wings are straight up TERRIBLE, worst wings I&apos;ve ever had in my life. Bottom line is, if you&apos;re hungry, don&apos;t go there expecting to eat dinner. If you want drinks and snacks that are okay, then go there.","I grew up in the south so I love comfort food. Something about the way these carbs are prepared makes you want to lay around in happiness until you digest. The food at Ha! Does a good job at that. The venue is small and cozy with a bar that seats about 12-15 and about 8 or 9 tables.
I popped in for brunch right after a grueling workout and was ready to eat. Fortunately, the service is fast and I got my order in within minutes of sitting down. The biscuit and gravy I had was excellent and reminded me of the ones I would eat all the time in the south. 
I did not attend to their drink menu this time, but looking at their menu, I will definitely pop by in the near future. The supersized mimosas definitely has my interest.","Truffle fries were so good we had a second helping. Everyone at my table but me got the veggie burrito. With the sauce on top. I had a couple bites it was fantastic. Just because I didn&apos;t want to get the same plate as everybody else I got the cheese enchiladas they were very good also.

I was so happy all the reviews were very good. My husband was quite apprehensive. Can&apos;t wait to go back!","Food was great!
Had the truffle fries, along with the classic breakfast.
Truffle fries came with a dipping sauce that paired very well with them and piqued the interest of my taste buds!

Food came out fairly quick and the atmosphere was very cozy!

I definitely recommend!","This is a cute, low-key, neighborhood place with creative comfort food and great music!! It was a great spot to hang out late night with my friends. Service was great and food was fresh and well prepared. Even the picky eaters were happy here. We&apos;ll definitely be back!","I am giving this place 5 stars and it&apos;s not a 5 star restaurant if it makes sense. It&apos;s a dive. Looks like a gay bar I used to go to. Needs a paint job badly. Looks rough. There is a small bar in front and tables. TV had start trek on it. It&apos;s Monday morning around 11am. I came for breakfast. I am on vacation. Ordered brioche French Toast and poached eggs. Waitress was friendly and accommodating. What I ordered is not really &quot;on the menu&quot; as a thing and I got exactly what I wanted!  And I might say everything was scrumptious. Yes, scrumptious!","First time visit after all these years seeing the truck at Starbucks HQ. Had the Aloha slider, great value and super tasty. I was uber impressed with the flavors and freshness. The macaroni salad with a bite of spam was pretty good also. Looking forward to a return visit and trying out some of the other recommendations from yelp reviews.

Thanks for a great lunch :)","The Kalbi Beef Taco is to die for! After eating mine, I told all my coworkers to do themselves a favor and get one. 

macaroni salad with spam was good, but nothing special.

The Aloha Pork slider was good too, but the Kalbi Beef really stole the show for me.","I will go so far out of my way to eat here whenever I can.  The Kailua pork tacos make me dance while I eat them, so I eat them standing up.  They give me happy warm island vibes every time.  I&apos;m finally ready to branch out on the menu and try some other things on the menu. I guess I&apos;ll have to follow them around like a taco groupie this summer to get all the way through the menu!","Marination mobile was my introduction to to their place and have been a regular at the truck and their restaurant ever since.

had their kimchi fried rice with spicy pork the first time and almost always get it.","Food trucks are always cool! Good deal, tasty food. I&apos;m happy. Not a huge fan of the over-the-top cabbage, but I guess that is this place&apos;s &quot;thing.&quot; Doesn&apos;t ruin it though.
Definitely getting it again.
I got the spam slider, chicken slider, 2 tacos, and the quesadilla. All tasted vaguely the same (as in nothing really stuck out as better than the others) but they were all good! Happy about the use of the Hawaiian King&apos;s rolls. Those are super good.","Tacos: good.  Kalbi beef was tender, jalapenos added pop, and the slaw was pretty crunchy (though it was too dry).  Tofu taco had a good amount of their famous sauce.

Spam slider: meh.  Spam was very salty, and the bread to meat ratio was waaay too high.  They should have been more generous with the meat or added some other filling to the sandwich (like a fried egg, maybe?)

Side of slaw: waaaay too dry as a side.  It was barely vinegary and I felt I was basically eating dry little cabbage shards.  Disappointing.

I&apos;ll probably opt for a kimchi fried rice bowl next time.","My husband and I love marination station,  and have been known to drive across town to find them,  but when we looked online, and verified with the truck and the location that they would be at Stoup Brewing in Ballard from 12 to 8 we were very frustrated and disappointed to see then gone.  They reported that it was a slow day... And apparently they didn&apos;t want to wait for the dinner crowd.  

We were there at 5 pm on Saturday night,  people are pouring in, the Stoup staff was very apologetic that the truck flaked out.  Not only did marination loose business,  but so did Stoup.

It just seems like a shoddy way to run a business.   If you commit to being somewhere. BE THERE.",Everyone loved our marination station food truck for our seattle wedding. True Hit! The food was to die for!,"So for the past few weeks I have seen the enormous lines at this food truck parked on 1st ave outside Starbucks corporate headquarters. I truly cant imagine waiting an hour for food but people do. When i checked other locations I found they are on 4th by the design center on Thursdays so we gave it it try today. Very sleepy location no line and just a few people coming and going. We tried the spam and Kalua pork sliders and the beef, chicken and spicy pork tacos. Everything was great. I will be back next Thursday and will get 1 beef and 2 spicy pork tacos. Might order a spam slider too as that was delicious. Highly recommend giving them a try especially at a less crowded location. Staff was friendly and connected, service was exceptional.","BEST food truck food I&apos;ve probably ever had!! Fresh ingredients, tasty food combos and love the staff in the truck. It helps to order ahead of time using the &apos;Yorder&apos; app, so that you don&apos;t have to wait in line...otherwise the line can definitely get pretty long. But so worth it...wait if you can!","A coworker introduced me to this truck Downtown on &quot;taco Tuesday&quot; and recommended I order a variety on my first visit. 

I ordered a chicken taco, a tofu taco, a pork slider, and Mac salad. It was a ton of food and I don&apos;t think I need as much next time (but that is me) -- next time I would probably get two tofu tacos and Mac salad. The tofu was really good. Everything else was delicious too, I just happened to like the tofu better than the chicken. The pork was amazing. The Mac salad with spam was also delicious, especially with some Sriracha added!

The line can get really long, so I would recommend going before noon if possible. They move pretty quickly, but my coworker got a quesadilla and those take longer so we did wait about 5-7 minutes for that. My food was done in about 2 minutes. 

I will definitely be back. The food is unique and delicious!","Ugggh! Why did I have to discover Marination?!?! Living in LA really puts a damper on things when a Marination craving kicks in and taunts me! *scream*
So Seattlelites or in-town visitors, stop wasting time and do both you and me a favor and order their kimchi fried rice. Once you&apos;re done drowning yourself in some amazingly delicious good eats you can count your lucky stars and thank me later.

Yup, you&apos;re welcome.","I kept hearing about this amazing taco truck that is in Belltown only on Tuesdays.  Apparently everyone at my work loves this place.  Where the heck have I been?  I thought it was just a regular Mexican taco truck.  What a surprise to find this Korean/Hawaiian goodness!  

I was really weary about spam.  Just the thought of it makes me wrinkle my nose.  BUT the mac with spam just sounded good and at $1.50 how can you go wrong?!  I tried it and wow it was really good!  I told myself I&apos;d pick out the spam but I wound up eating it too and loved it.

I also got one of the beef tacos and one aloha pork slider.  Really tasty.  The beef was juicy.  Whatever sauce is on there is fantastic.  The slider didn&apos;t disappoint either.  I was famished and these three items totaled $6 and was so satisfying.

 I am now trying to figure out how I can get them to cater a lunch for my work.  My coworkers will absolutely love me.

Cash only so be prepared!  Oh and even with a huge long line, they were super fast!","Probably my favorite mobile eatery in Seattle, it embodies all the best qualities of a food truck--cheap, delicious, and completely addictive.  I dislike the term &quot;fusion,&quot; but their menu draws on Mexican, Korean, and Hawaiian influences to create original plates without any gimmick-novelty factor.

Once I waited for 45 minutes in the pouring Seattle rain for my tacos (one of each flavor) and spam musubi.  And when I was finished, I was tempted to get right back in line for round 2.  

Also, they get bonus points for having a quick and organized ordering process.  I&apos;ve had orders lost before at other busy food trucks, but Marination really knows how to run it.","I&apos;m totally loving this food truck crazy spreading across the states!  As a girl from Hawaii (when plate lunch trucks originated) I totally appreciate how trendy this kind of thing has become. 

2 thumbs waaay up for Marination that serves spam, tofu, and kim chee fried rice!  and for being named &quot;Best Food Truck in America&quot; 2009!  What an honor!

Four of us hit up Marination on a Friday for lunch while it was parked by Safeco Field.  It sure was a treck to get there and I was starting to regret wearing heals, but once that food hits your lips... you realize it was all worth it!

The aloha sliders with shreaded kahlua pig was so yummy and the tofu and kalbi chicken tacos were made with freshest ingredients and cooked to perfection.  The kim chee fried rice was even more winnahs!  So tasty and I espeically love how it was so beautifully packed in a take out box with an egg on top and green onion as garnish.  It&apos;s gourmet lunch truck take out!  Suh-weet!

Best of all, the prices were awesome.","Just had this for lunch. Line was ridiculous! I had the fried rice with steak and a steak taco. For $2.50, I don&apos;t know that the sliders or the tacos are worth it. The rice was good and you get a good amount of meat, but there&apos;s a lot of rice as well. If you&apos;re into Asian food, I would try Explosion across from Veggie Grill.","Great kalbi tacos 
Spam musubi awesomeness
kick-ass kimchi rice

#yelphaiku","Good tacos and friendly service.  I ordered the Spicy Pork, Kalbi and Hawaiian pork tacos which were all good.  I&apos;ll be back.","Even my mom would approve of their Spicy Pork Kimchi Fried Rice!  I hope she doesn&apos;t see this. Yes, my traditional Korean mom is an amazing cook and she makes &quot;bomb&quot; kimchi and kimchi fried rice.  Good kimchi = good kimchi fried rice. Enough about my mom.  

This cart shows up like a block away from my work every Monday.  I am the luckiest guy.  I have tried everything on their menu from the Tacos to the special Musubi&apos;s. Everything on their menu is amazing and delicious.  But, as I have noted earlier the highlight is the Spicy Pork Kimchi Fried Rice with sunny side on top. 

Spicy Pork is marinated and cooked perfectly.  It actually reminds me of Spicy Pork BBQ&apos;s from home.  Very close and that is pretty good in my opinion.  This meaty goodness is layered on top of their delicious Kimchi fried rice.  That is topped with a sunny side up egg.  WOW!  Game over!  That completes a triple threat of probably one of my favorite dishes in town (I know...I say this a lot.  I have a lot of favorite dishes).  

When you dig in and the egg yolk drips into the spicy sweet, salty pork and kimchi fried rice, you are completely mesmerized by the flavors that are created by the combination of the three.  I am salivating as I write this paragraph!  

There is a certain level of fear of this place with less adventurous eaters.  I say this is a very good place to expand your taste.  You can slowly work up to the fried rice by trying out their Kahlua Pork sliders and various Tacos.  I recommend this place with two thumbs up to anybody.  

Note: To beat the HUGE LINE that forms around lunch time, I order online using Yorder ahead of time.  This way I can have it ready on the time I choose and cut in front of everybody to get my food and walk away. (I am not a Yorder representative but really it takes me 2 mins order and 5 min to pick it up vs. standing in line for 20 min.)","I had the chicken taco and the kalbi steak taco with some kimchi fried rice. Oh man was I full! But it was so good. The tacos are deceivingly filling and the rice proportion is easily sharable between 2 people FYI. 
Definitely a treat. I am so glad they moved up to the Chinatown area rather than SODO, way shorter walk! I will definitely be coming back here! 

If the line is long - that usually tells me &quot;you know it is going to be good&quot; because no one would wait in a 30min+ line if it sucked!","Amazingly delicious pie, delivered straight to your door (if you&apos;re in the delivery area at least, which I am thankfully).  Several vegetarian options, plus all the sweet options.  They say to warm to room temperature for those but I&apos;ve found 2 minutes in the microwave will warm them right up too.  So far I&apos;ve tried the wild mushroom, caramel apple, and buttercream and they are all delicious.  Will order again.","The meat pie is better than the meat pie that I had in Scotland several years ago.  I do not think I will be going to Scotland again due to covid, so I will order from 314Pie.  The crust is delicious!!!",Ordered these for delivery and they were sooo good! The Cordon Bleu is very flavorful. Will order again.,Food truck came to Maple valley. We have steak and mushroom pie. It was so good and the crust was flakey. Dessert I had carmel pecan pie it was not traditional which I was hoping for. But dang it was still good!,"This truck made a stop in our neighborhood this week and the line was down the block! I have heard good things, so we jumped in line and waited for the chance to try some pies! They were out of quite a few things by the time it was our turn, but they still had the old standard &quot;chicken&quot; so I figured it would be a good test to see how they stack up against Marie Calendar&apos;s. Initially I was a little concerned by the size. Would this be sufficient for a complete dinner? Cold winter night + COVID eating habits had me doubtful! Thank goodness I was wrong. The crust was flaky and rich and the filling was seasoned perfectly. It&apos;s much less &quot;creamy&quot; than Marie&apos;s version but it definitely has superior crust and flavors. I was satisfied.","Found this adorable pie truck while pondering through Woodinville wine district for a leisurely walk. They were parked up near Lord Lion Winery and after looking on Instagram, this is one of the few times they were on the Eastside so I took advantage of picking up a sweet pie! They have lots of savory options, but I was craving something sweet. They had a pecan pie, and a seasonal cherry peach with walnut streusel. I went for the seasonal option. It cost just $5, and was huge! 
The staff were fully masked and had a touch less pay system, as well as friendly. 
Once I got the pie home, I ended up splitting over 2 days. The cherries and peaches were jam packed into the fresh pie crust, and the fruit clearly fresh and packed with flavor. I&apos;m hoping to try some of their savory and other sweet options soon. Wow I&apos;m so happy I found this place! I hope they are back around East Seattle area more often!!",Very good ingredients but unfortunately the savory pies were dry.,"Saw a post on my neighborhood FB group about ordering these. Ours came tonight and I&apos;m so excited I had to leave a review! We had chicken pot pie, lamb &amp; potato ,wild mushroom apple and a custard pie. Everything was PERFECTION! Okay you put them in the oven (sweet pies already cooked) for 30 minutes and they come out ready to go. I pulled out tin foil to wrap the edges and then decided not to. Does not need it. Crust is ridiculously amazing. I&apos;m reordering right now and got sidetracked to leave a review. Maybe I&apos;m just so grateful to have real food at home I didn&apos;t make that I&apos;m overly content but I do not think so.","We used 314 Pie for our wedding. We had a really wonderful and easy experience working with them.

Booking them was super easy. Deke responded to all of our emails very quickly. He was able to customize an order that included several yummy appetizers. 

The prices were THOUSANDS of dollars cheaper than other catering trucks and companies. 

For the actual event, working with them is best summarized with the word &quot;easy&quot;. Deke communicated clearly, was completely prompt (our wedding was 2.5 hours from Seattle and required a ferry ride), arranged the food in a beautiful display, was super friendly and great with our guests and best of all- the food was terrific. 

I would highly recommend them for other catering events.","To start off... I&apos;m an Aussie :) I wouldn&apos;t call myself a meat pie connoisseur though. In the past 5.5 years I haven&apos;t had many pies at all, so maybe my review is positively biased because of nostalgia.

I&apos;ve tried their steak pie and lamb pie several times when their truck comes to Redmond. Although I&apos;ve had some amazing pies back home, I&apos;m pretty happy with 314 and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re always close by. I usually like lamb a lot, but their steak pie is better. I&apos;m not sure what it is, but the flavour of the lamb pie doesn&apos;t hit the spot for me.

Today, I tried their wild mushroom pie for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. This is a solid pie! It&apos;s rare for me to prefer a vegetarian option over meat. I think they&apos;ve done a great job with the flavours in this mushroom pie. Will definitely get it again :)","I&apos;m updating my review.

The owner got a hold of me and explained that a few weeks ago they had discovered an issue with their pies that was short lived and remedied it just after I tried their pies.

He offered me a refund and a free pie.  I think that is very fair and kind.  While I can&apos;t take him up on it because I rarely ever get to where his food truck is, I thank him for it and I trust that the issue has been resolved. 

His customer service shows that he really does care about his product and that is very much appreciated.

Thank you for excellent customer service.","Just tried two of their pies and was impressed. Their vegetable curry pie was very nice. It had a nice amount of spice, the veggies were cooked really well, and the crust was really tasty. I have a gluten sensitivity but cheated a little with their pies and it was worth it. Their wildflower honey custard dessert pie was perfect; not too sweet. The price for both pies was $13 for both pies, good price. Would cheat here again","I have no idea what all the fuss is about. I got the Lamb Pie with Stout Gravy and it was a dry, overpriced, tiny portion of mehhh. The lamb was tough and overcooked, the gravy tasted nice but was not oozing and adding that sauce to each bite like it should. The crust was burnt around the edges and a lot of it was just stuck to the bottom. The pie itself was tiny for price. And this was just 10 minutes after they opened so it&apos;s not like they might have been sitting out all day.

I love meat pies and eat them a lot, both at home and out. This one really missed the mark on multiple fronts. I&apos;ll pass. No thank you.","Decent food truck, all the prices are not round numbers (i.e. chicken pot pie for $8.22) , but with tax, everything comes out to round numbers say, $9. Really tasty pies. Yes, it&apos;s 100% butter, so the crust is 100% amaaazing.  It has an extra bit of savouriness, almost like theres a smidge of cheese in there. Either way. It does not disappoint. 
 
Filling options were varied. I had bites of the cajun jambalaya, lamb pie, and chicken pot pie. The Jambalaya wasn&apos;t too spicy but was terrifically smoky, resulting from the slices of sausage inside. It was also packed with rice, so unlike a soupy pot pie, it was quite solid.  The chicken pot pie and lamb were more classic pot pies. Delicious. 

The pies aren&apos;t too big, it comfortably fits in one hand, but it is satisfying - a portion that is just right. 

There were a couple sweet and savory options sold out, like the pecan pie, by the time we went (2 hours after the beginning of the lunch hour).  I think it&apos;s not uncommon so it&apos;s better to get here early to have all the options!",We ordered several pies for delivery this week.  They were delivered right on time (right at the start of the delivery window for our neighborhood) in an insulated bag.  An instruction sheet was included that provided cooking instructions and a key to the symbol code in the pie crust (that allows you to identify what type of pie it is).  We have only tried the steak and mushroom pie so far.  We cooked it as directed (30 minutes in an oven preheated to 400 ‚Ñâ)  and it was excellent.  We would definitely order again!,"I found this food truck, as it was one of the food vendors at the Snohomish Beer Festival.  With your ticket you get a voucher for a food item, so decided to use the voucher here for the Lamb Pie w/ Stout Gravy, as it was recommended by the cashier as his favorite.  

Although the cashier was very friendly and was able to get my food as soon as I paid I didn&apos;t like the pie as much as I had hoped.  There is good flavor with the stout gravy, but the shreds of lamb seemed to be on the more dry side, so the gravy was necessary.  The presentation of your own personal pie is nice, but was mostly disappointed by the small portion of the stuffing.  Because of the small amount of lamb, veggies and stout the pie served more as a snack than a meal.  And I wasn&apos;t a pan of the thick parts of the crust where the folding was, as the texture was hard and flaky.  The fodo truck is a cool concept, but wish the food has been better.","I found this wonderful food truck on seattlefoodtruck.com. They reached out to me and provided a quote for a holiday lunch I threw at my company. They were very helpful explaining the menu and have very reasonable pricing. We order 150 savory pies and 150 sweet pie and people were very impressed.

The great thing about this truck is they can move through orders super fast. We rushed the door at 11am and with one person, they were able to fly through orders. 

The lamb was excellent and the dessert pie were fun.  I was worried about the size and that it would not be enough food but I was feeling it at the end of my savory pie and let me tell you, I can eat. 

Overall, great idea, execution, communication and food. Would highly recommend.","According to 314 Pie&apos;s site, they were supposed to be at the Broadway Farmers Market on Christmas Eve from 11 AM - 3 PM (see screenshot). However, we arrived at the market at 1 PM, and 314 Pie was not there. A round trip to the market in Capitol Hill cost us nearly $20 for the Ubers and an hour of wasted time. 

Recommendation for the owners: please update your site next time if you have special hours for Christmas Eve and other key days to avoid wasting your customers&apos; time, energy, and money.","Hit this truck at the Taco Truck Challenge. I had the Taco Pie and one of their chocolate chip almond cookies! 

The pie was pretty simple, just taco meat and cheese, but it was really good (I ended up topping it with some salsa, onions, and cilantro at a different truck, don&apos;t tell on me). The cookie was REALLY good; It was really thick and warm, so when I broke it in half there was a large amount of gooey chocolate.

The food warranted the 5-star, but the only reason I am writing a review is because of what I saw one of the employees doing. I circled back to throw away some garbage, and one of their employees was rummaging through the garbage can outside the truck, and sorting the trash! She pulled out all the compostable items, and put them in the correct bin; pulled out all the recyclables, and then recycled them! Good for you 314 Pie, I applaud the extra effort to help out the environment.","In my quest to try every food truck in the area, I find myself looking at 314 Pie, a blue truck with premade, ready to go personal sweet/savory pies. 

It&apos;s simple, they have a selection of about 8-10 types, 5 savory, and 3 sweet, with a few seasonal/limited edition ones to keep you coming back. 

I had the Steak, Cheese and Mushroom one, which was the recommendation of the awesome food trucker worker. She briskly pulled one out of the baked goods display/warmer in the truck and into a neat paper bag, without a miss-step, a fork was stabbed, leaking out the smell of amazing meat filled goodness.  Good gracious! 

It was hot and delicious... I mean the meat was seasoned nicely, it was filled with flavor.  Sure the pie itself isn&apos;t that big, but when I got back to my building, and sat down, the smell made my team instantly hateful of me.  This is one that you can eat fast, if you just need to eat.. but if you take a moment to eat, bite by bite, you will greatly enjoy it. and the value behind it makes it worth the money, which was 8 bucks! 

Yikes, but it&apos;s worth it.   They are either around Amazon or Microsoft, and they do catering.  Recommendation, go there at least a few times, and find time to savor it.","Great quality salads and ingredients. I love building my own salad and my favorite dressing is the lemon vini. Good COVID precautions put into the restaurant, but I would still recommend ordering online and doing pickup just because it&apos;s so easy! The bread isn&apos;t the best bread I&apos;ve ever had, but let&apos;s be real it&apos;s bread it can&apos;t be that bad. A good place to go for a quality salad, it is on the pricey side though.","I&apos;m a huge fan of Evergreens Salad, so it&apos;s nice to know that there&apos;s a location at U-Village for whenever I&apos;m in the area.  And I do find that at this location, the staff gives you a lot of bang for your buck! 

I visited Evergreens Salad for lunch while shopping at U-Village and ordered one of my favorite salads, the spicy kale caesar salad.  This salad has a kale base and unlike the traditional caesar salad, there&apos;s a kick to this one, as it comes with crushed jalapenos, seeds and all!  I definitely recommend trying this if you like spice and caesar salads.  And the employee there gave me a hefty amount, so much so that it would not fit in the large bowl I ordered.  They&apos;re definitely generous here. 

Space for dining is spacious enough, including some tables outside where it&apos;s dog-friendly.  As with its other locations, you can use your phone/rewards system here for transactions, and the menu features not just salads that you can customize, but grain bowls and wraps.  I love Evergreens, so find me back here when I need a healthy meal while shopping at U-Village.","I really wanted to like this place, but perhaps I came on a bad day. Tldr: tasty salad, I like the concept, but the service was pretty bad. 

My significant other ordered a wrap that came ripped. 

I ordered a large salad with a dressing on the side, but I had to come back because he&apos;d forgotten my dressing. I guess he also ran out of dressing and it wasn&apos;t filled all the way. Not a huge deal if he hadn&apos;t seem so annoyed with me the entire time I ordered. 

It was also my first time in, and the guy seemed really annoyed at everything I picked, and any question I asked. Especially when I asked if you could do a half and half protein.
I didn&apos;t think it was such an egregious question, as it&apos;s a chipotle style establishment. (No half and half option, it&apos;s $3 any meats). Perhaps I came on an off day, as a lot of the reviews rave about the friendly service. There was no line either. 

Maybe it would make things go smoother if everything was labeled. I had to ask what some things were like the dried apricot, much to the dismay of the dude working there. 

The salad tasted good though, I got romaine Lettuce, mixed greens, arugula, with a ton of toppings with the evergreen caeser. They Smash it so it&apos;s got a good texture. Something I&apos;ll incorporate in my salads at home. 

We also got a side of tomato soup (+$4), which was pretty tasty. A bit more sour than a lot of other tomato soups, but tasted fresh. 

I love the idea of eating fresh, locally produced veggies and fresh food you customize, but it wasn&apos;t a very welcoming or friendly atmosphere.","Our family loves Evergreen but find that this location at U Village consistently has some of the worst quality control and customer service we&apos;ve ever seen. If I could give zero stars I would. 

Online orders are consistently incorrectly made, swapping add-one and ingredients for the wrong salads, completely leaving other add-ons, etc. 

The most egregious happened with Shashonda (sp?) today. We ordered 2 combos for $12 each before tax and was charged $33. After realizing the mistake, we called to correct the issue and she instantly was defensive and combative, repeatedly blaming the difference on sales tax and add-ons. None of the substitutions or added ingredients had extra charge, I checked the app! And yes, our sales tax is expensive, but not 37.5%!  She clearly knew she was wrong but insisted on her stance. Never going to this Evergreens again.","Evergreens and ever so many toppings! I am a fan. 

For so many reasons. This chain is similar to Pluto&apos;s, Sweetgreen, Mixt, etc. They have a choose your own or pre-made salads and wraps. But, I actually liked it better for a few reasons.

1. All the toppings! That&apos;s right. &quot;How many toppings can I get?&quot;
&quot;AS MANY AS YOU WANT.&quot; I don&apos;t know if this was by some error, but I got UNLIMITED TOPPINGS. Boom, done, drop dead, amazed.
2.Greek yogurt, lower calorie dressing option! This was a nice offering that other places don&apos;t have.
3. They have housemade bbq sauce you can get which you can get as a finisher - super awesome.
4. Yummy focaccia bread included. I like this better than Mixt&apos;s bread.
5. SO cheap - relatively. $9 a pop for a salad is a few dollars less than SF chains. Yes, it is still lettuce and some veggies or whatnot. And, a lot of items that cost extra at other chains are included here. 
6. Also, witty names for their pre-made salads. I have an appreciation for some food humor. 

A healthy lunch option at UVillage! Plus, UNLIMITED TOPPINGS - whether accidental or not, I will take it!","We randomly came here for lunch and were pleasantly surprised with our visit!

They have all sorts of salads you can choose from or you can make your own. We ordered the El Sombrero and The Situation. You can ask them to leave an ingredient out you don&apos;t want. You can also ask for dressing on the side, which I thought was nice. 

It was really fast moving, just like chipotle. The staff was SUPER friendly, which made the experience even better. 

Salads overall were pretty good! They were definitely fresh, had a good amount of ingredients and good flavor. Mine came with a cilantro lime dressing, I didn&apos;t love it but that&apos;s my own opinion. Other than that, they were great. 

Our lunch was under $20 and we were both full. We did not add protein to our salads, I think it would&apos;ve been $3 extra for each. We didn&apos;t feel it was needed after we ate. The salads are pretty good size.

I would definitely come back. It&apos;s nice to have fast and lighter options in the village!","One of my favorite places around campus if you&apos;re looking for a healthy meal! The ingredients are all fresh vegetables, fruit, etc... and no matter how often I come here it&apos;ll never get old. Highly recommend the El Sombrero and adding on tons of add-ons. The regular portion size is huge and will definitely fill you up.","Evergreens is a perfect place to come when you&apos;re craving a healthy, filling meal. Depending on the time of day you come it can be busy with a line to the door but it&apos;s always worth the wait. The ingredients is always fresh and the menu changes frequently which I like. 

I enjoyed the Dawson&apos;s geek which has romaine, cucumber, tomatoes, olives, marinated mushrooms, feta and garbanzo beans. I love that it comes with a piece of bread and that at the end when they chop your salad they ask you the amount of dressing you want, light, medium or heavy so you can control the amount depending on how you like your salads. You can add extra ingredients for no charge besides avocado and meat cost extra. I always enjoy my meal here and never had any complaints.","I would like them more...if they got the order right. I have consistently ordered from this location and when I went to pick it up, the order was wrong, by a handful of items, not just one. Salads are delicious, but it has been very frustrating to not receive the correct order.","Whenever I decide to treat myself out to lunch, I always find myself coming here. Evergreens is a pretty decent spot to grab lunch in university village if you&apos;re look for something light. My go to is the spicy kale salad and I love making it my own version by adding their pickled onions, corn, chickpeas, and cucumbers. Their ingredients are incredibly fresh and the focaccia is a nice cherry on the top. I love seeing the salads get mixed, it&apos;s actually kind of incredible how fast it can be done. Each salad goes for $10, with upgrades to a larger size at $11. The best bang for your buck would be ordering their kid&apos;s size which goes for $6 and it is just as filling as the regular size! Don&apos;t bother adding protein or avocado in your salad. It&apos;s normally an extra $2 or $3 for a very small portion.

I would come here during lunch time with caution. Sometimes they can get you in and out in 10 minutes, but there&apos;s been times where I&apos;ve found myself trapped in there for 20 minutes. It may be best to order through online if you&apos;re looking to avoid long wait times. Overall, a good place to grab a delicious and healthy meal.","My fav part about this place is their salad names. Kudos to whoever comes up with these.

I&apos;ve come to terms with the fact that salads are $10+. However, I have not come to terms with the fact that a little 2oz cup of chicken is $3. How do I know it&apos;s 2oz? Well they forgot to include chicken in my salad so I went back to get the chicken added. After the lady at the register inspected my salad (because, yes, I sometimes lie about whether or not there is chicken in my salad to get more chicken), I was given this cute little cup of chicken (see photo). Cute is to describe baby chicks, not to describe the chicken portion that I am given at a salad bar.

Salad itself was ok. I ordered the Thai salad with the curry coconut dressing. Again, small scoops of toppings. My fav was the blasted broccoli. Wish the curry coconut dressing flavor was stronger but I guess it wouldn&apos;t be as healthy. 

Would rather get a chipotle salad next door or wait for a Tender Greens to open here in Seattle.","Love them. Super fresh and delicious. 

Cons- always busy. And I don&apos;t recommend ordering online, typically something is wrong/missing.","Honestly pretty disappointed. I went in wanting the El Sombrero with no jalape√±os, chips or cheese and to add chicken. The girl was making my salad so quickly that she asked if i wanted everything in it and before i even had 1 second to respond she already put the chips and jalape√±os in. Then, I asked to add chicken. She didn&apos;t. Then, never asked if I wanted my dressing light medium or heavy. Just did what she wanted. Not very friendly or good customer service.","I am a refugee from california, where eating a huge salad as a meal is a beautiful and wonderful and appreciated thing!  Here in the Northwest it&apos;s like a barren landscape for salad. Evergreen salad is the best! Lots of creative options, and they give you a nice big salad.","Salads are delicious... when made correctly, if ever. They consistently either don&apos;t put all of the standard ingredients in, or add different ones, which is baffling since the ingredient cards are right in front of them.","I&apos;ve only been here a handful of times (in a more realistic sense, probably about three since this review) but I love coming here to create my own salad bowl, especially on days when I didn&apos;t prep my own! 

At first sight, you already know this store is healthy af. Which person are you: One who walks by quickly and go straight to dessert, or you&apos;re a salad loving individual who would get excited with a joint like this? Either way, slow down and give this place a try! You&apos;ll leave feeling great eating a bowl of greens. Plus, you can modify anything you want to fit your taste or choose one or their pre-made bowls. Very clean space, and my own experience with service was quite alright. At times, some of the workers there seem passive and sometimes annoyed that they have to work? I guess the reviews critical of the service isn&apos;t too far off. But with my first visit, they were rather helpful and upsized me bowl to a large for free since there was so much extra greens. Anyway, as long as I get a full salad bowl!","I love evergeens so much and I&apos;d definitely say I come in frequently enough to remember the employees faces! Everyone is always so good at making the salads taste just right and delicious. 
However, today they had new people making salads it was easy to tell they were brand new. If there are new people, please have the experienced employees help the new ones out :( everyone always does a great job of putting a lot of salad in the bowl which is the whole point of going to a salad bar joint, but the new person barely put any salad in my bowl. He also did not ask if I wanted all the toppings, or really ask about any of the extra finishes etc. So just please have the experienced workers watch the new ones until they&apos;re comfortable making the salads how they should be made, especially if there is 0 line in the shop!","I&apos;ve been frequenting this place quite often this summer and I have to increase my rating. Here is why:

1. Service is fast. 
2. Ingredients are fresh. 
3. Portions are generous. 
4. I&apos;ve tried The Super Bowl and The Sombrero and both are delicious. 
5. Delivery preparation is great. They don&apos;t mix in the dressing or chop it which keeps it fresh. 
6. The prices are reasonable.  

Some people have complained that the prices are too high. Have you eaten out in Seattle? If you order a $9 salad at most restaurants you get a side salad portion. If you don&apos;t get the salad chopped at Evergreens Salad you can actually see how much salad you get - and it&apos;s a generous portion.","Tucked away in the heart of University Village, this is the king of organic restaurants.  It&apos;s not a big space, but it is efficiently designed.  A very clean and earthy environment.

I had the Super Bowl.  The gal making the salad was very patient and informative with helping me with my selections.  She even gave me a few extra scoops of Quinoa!  Very fresh, organic, healthy and delicious.

I stumbled across another Evergreens Salad near the City Center in Bellevue!","I like salads with my meats. I&apos;m not the person to just order a salad, but because I had classes the rest of the day I didn&apos;t want to induce a food coma. So I turned to the alternate of Chipotle of the &quot;tree-huggers&quot; Chipotle. 

I really liked the salad! Even though I ordered a small, it was enough that I was feeling full, but a good full. It was $9 for the sombrero which I added chicken to, but that scoop of chicken was not justified for $3. Now I know a company with several locations is hard to ask for a justification, but that made me really upset knowing that the kind of chicken that is usually in the high school cafeteria&apos;s chicken bar is an extra $3. Disclaimer: I love my meats, so maybe it could just be me who just needs to not choose a salad restaurant buttttt I&apos;d like to think $3 for a scoop of chicken is just kinda ????. 

Despite the lettuce and it&apos;s taste, I hope that the experience at Evergreens isn&apos;t always like what I experienced, or else I could see a lot of people choosing the QFC salads. The line was long at 1:45pm but not because there were many people, but because there&apos;s one person scooping all the ingredients you want. Note, this isn&apos;t Chipotle or any heating up place where you have to wait to have your food adjusted. You just wait because there&apos;s only one person who can make a salad for many people- so I waited while he&apos;s starting up another person&apos;s salad, and finishing up the person&apos;s salad before me. 

Shortly after, you&apos;re moving along the lines of the sauces and the next person who then displaces your salad onto a cutting board, to get crushed, and to add the sauce. BUT, while waiting for my turn at the sauces, the cashier curtly signaled that she was ready to ring me up. It&apos;s confusing because it&apos;s a line, but because they take so long to make the salad, they want you to pay for it and basically go back in the line- it was confusing for my first time. 

It took 15 minutes to get the $13.29 small salad- those numbers seem bigger than they should be.

(+Optional garlic bread mmm)","10 stars if we could.
The best place to get your falafel/hummus fix!
We&apos;ve order takeout from them numerous times. 
Each time its a quick pickup the food is hot, fresh and ample.
Alex the owner is amazing! Super personable with excellent service.
Need a sweet try the baklava... it melts in your mouth.
Honestly cant say how pleased we are to have found Gyro and more.
Highly Recommend!!","Great food, vegan options, and the kindest staff! So glad I work nearby and can take advantage of their great takeout service.",Was craving garlic fries really bad so my boyfriend and I got the garlic fries for pick up. Perfectly crispy deliciousness! Excited to try other items on the menu next time!,"Ratings
Pizza - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Price - 5/5
Will definitely be back to try more food.",Very satisfying and tasty meals for a good price. I recommend the lamb shawarma sandwich.,"Place is awesome!  New to the area.  
I like going there for a quick sandwich.   But the best part about this place is actually the pizzas.  I can usually take down a lot of food, and the pizza from this place took me 3 days to crush.  Super delicious, kind of reminded me of a White pizza, but super great ingredients, delicious and awesome.","I live close by and am really excited this is in the neighborhood. My boyfriend and I just went for the first time today. The place is clean, service good, and a full/good menu. We got a kabob salad and a gyro salad. Both were very good, but the gyro meat was better. The chicken kabob was actually ground chicken - not chicken cubes as expected (and as I prefer). We will be back regardless!","Very clean, beautiful decor and super friendly staff.
As for the food the baklava is very delicious and fresh and the gyros were very flavorful the greek fries were good as well they have a seasoning on them that I&apos;ve never had on them before that was unique and flavorful.
Can&apos;t wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!","This place is amazing!! So glad I live just a few blocks away. The food is delicious, the portions are good, and the guy who runs the place is so kind. Highly recommend.","What a nice surprise! The food was delicious and so flavorful! We got the gyro platter and fries! Yumm! There was a lot of tahini sauce and feta cheese sprinkled over the food...  also l, the owner was very nice",The gyro was delicious &amp; the staff was super friendly too. Glad this moved into our neighborhood. Definitely going back. Give them some love during these tough quarantine times!,"We love this spot... Always fresh and always delicious. On average, we order about every 7-10 days and they are always consistent. Today, we ordered and it arrived as fresh as always but they included a free side of their amazing fries with a &quot;thank you&quot; attached to it. During these hard time I find it refreshing that with everything these small businesses are dealing with that the good ones still make a point to extend their gratitude. Thanks guys!","I have been driving by this spot for a couple months patiently anticipating and drooling for it to
open it up and it FINALLY HAPPENED THIS WEEK (!!!!) Ordered the Falafel Combo plate to go which came with a side greek salad, hummus, rice &amp; pita. It was really delicious - so fresh and flavorful! I recommend ordering a side tzatziki and hot sauce. The hot sauce packs some heat which I love....I highly recommend you check it out :)","I&apos;ve been strolling by this place for months in anticipation of it opening, and this week it finally did! I tested the menu out for the first time tonight, and can easily see this being my go-to for a quick dinner in the neighborhood. The staff is friendly, the restaurant clean, menu is affordable, and the complimentary citrus cucumber water is fresh and flavorful. 

Which leads me to the food: 
Seattle has a fairy large Mediterranean scene, which is very hit or miss, especially for delivery. It&apos;s hard to find a place that&apos;s consistently good, but I think we may have found a strong contender! Everything was fresh and cooked to order. The gyro sandwich had tender, flavorful chunks of meat, and incredibly fresh vegetables, none of which contained browning lettuce of rancidly sharp onion flavor. I was left craving more, but also pleasantly full. The French fries were also good, but could use a bit more seasoning. However, the  insanely tasty hot sauce packed the perfect punch of flavor to compliment the fries. 

Overall, highly recommend. I look forward to trying more of the menu, and one of the three different flavors of baklava.","Great option in Dexter, I usually get the chicken shawarma and love their dolmas. Can&apos;t wait to try their new pizzas. The staff is super friendly, love going there.",Ordered from them today. It was really good and the owner is supper friendly. If you&apos;re in SLU drop by!,"I&apos;ve been waiting for this place to open for months, crossing my fingers that this will become my go-to gyro place. It now is! The restaurant is very clean and friendly staff. I had the Gyro and the Greek Fries, both were very delicious. The meat in the gyro and the fries are very well seasoned. I can&apos;t wait to go back and try out what else they have to offer.",Good gyros for a good price from good people. Adam took good care of my party. What else can you ask for? I&apos;ll be back!,These guys are amazing. Their food has always been so tasty and they make you feel like family. So happy to have them right downstairs!,"I ate twice from Gyro &amp; More. Our work is close, and my work mate was picking up. First time Gyro plate was ok, it filled me up, but nothing really to brag about. Second time I had the Chicken Gyro, which tasted really boring. Most disappointing part of it, that they didn&apos;t put any onions in it! The chicken and sauce had hardly any flavor. That was it, my workmate agreed, and we just disposed their flyer into the recycling bin.","Zaina is my JAAAAAAAM!
They serve up super fresh and flavorful dishes.
From a couple plates for dinner or just a sandwich at lunch they always deliver.
Go to dish: lamb shawarma 

Also during COVID they have raised prices 1$","I have a fondness for this place.  You drive by on Lake City Way, and the neon signs beckon to you to come try this food!  It&apos;s like the Las Vegas of Shwarma.  Right now, during COVID, you can walk in to order and take out.  You have a choice of lamb, beef, or chicken. The pita on the gyro is soft and puffy, and it&apos;s stuffed large with meat and topping.  Had the baklava which was phyllo pastry and sweetness and nuts layered in goodness.","Zaina is seriously some of the best falafel i&apos;ve had in Seattle! I&apos;ve lived in this city my entire life and have tried many a gyro plate/falafel sandwich across the city. Zaina is truly at the top in my opinion. Very flavorful meat and sauces, generous portions, and incredible customer service! I would give 6 stars if i could. Thank you Zaina crew for all of your hard ark this pandemic!!!","We&apos;ve passed this place many times and never thought to stop. Wish I had sooner!

First off the staff are super friendly. All the staff members greet you right when you walk in. Such a plus in my book.
The menu has many different options to appeal to all appetites!

We chose the gyro fries, beef gyro and a gyro plate. I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because each portion was HUGE. The flavors are delicious and you can tell everything is made with love.

They are quick and efficient! We waited 10 minutes tops!

Can&apos;t wait to come back and try others!","Ever since I moved to Maple Leaf, this has been one of my favorite quick post-work meals for my family. I love the Chicken Schwarma plate, the greek fries, and the Gyros. They are all delicious, affordable and quick. 

Do order ahead of time and expect a line if you go at dinner time. Yeah, it&apos;s that good. 

PS:  Get the hummus. YUM!","With its bright signs and prime location, this place definitely catches your attention on Lake City Way. We ordered ahead and got the garlic fries (amazing) and chicken shawarma platter, and we were not disappointed. The portions are hefty and delicious even as leftovers the following day. Can&apos;t wait to come back-","I don&apos;t know how many times I have to say it.  I wish Yelp would give us the ability to give 1/2 stars. I would give Zaina 4 1/2 stars if possible but can&apos;t quite give 5 stars yet. 

So our first experience with Zaina was hubby picking us up a chicken gyro plate &amp; lamb gyro plate to go. The menu doesn&apos;t indicate that they come with pita bread but they do. We still got 1 extra bread &amp; some extra tzatziki sauce. We both loved our food!  We each had enough for a second meal the next day. Our second time was less than one week later. We only ordered one lamb gyro plate to go and while it was enough for us I think I prefer the chicken and wish we would have got one of each again. Their rice is phenomenal. I will now judge all other rice against theirs. I think their Greek salad could be improved. The dice of the cucumbers &amp; tomatoes is too small and it would benefit from a dash of red vinegar. 

We got baklava both times and while tasty I think the layering of phyllo dough could be better. The bottom layers are too moist &amp; the top layers are too dry. 

I look forward to dining in next time &amp; trying their falafels.","Excellent quality spot. Unique and delicious Gyro with hummus. I&apos;ll definitely be back. I usually don&apos;t go on here and praise local business, but I should because honestly it&apos;s just a damn good gyro and I would eat it again.",Very disappointed with the Chicken and Lamb shawarma plate - the lamb was completely undercooked (that is the rarest I&apos;ve ever seen shawarma).  I was so disgusted -had to stop eating and throw it out. Food was cooked in less than 5 mins and that should have been a sign. Totally wasn&apos;t worth it and the owner seemed a bit rude. Definitely wouldn&apos;t go back.,"The gyros and spanakopeta are both fabulous...I&apos;m sure everything else is as well, but I can&apos;t get past those two favorites!  Best tzatziki sauce ever.","Wow! The food here is soo good. We had the chicken shawarma plate, falafel plate, and grilled eggplant. We ordered delivery of course. Everything arrived so fresh, still warm, and so delicious. We will definitely be ordering from here again! And can not wait to go eat there in person once that&apos;s possible.","So Good!! My gf and I have had a hard time lately finding good takeout! These guys knocked it out of the park. Love all the neon signs outside, and the inside has such a cozy vibe! Friendly staff... we ended up buying like everything, and it was all great!! Felafel sandwich... lamb gyro... greek fries... lentil soup x2.... baglavad.. and whatever those little pastry roll things with the chocolate on them. Plus 2 drinks, and the total was $45. So GOOD! Great portion sizes, and all the food was just so dang tasty. We were thankful they were open late, as we started looking for food just after 10pm. 11am-11pm. Now those are my kind of hours. Thanks again Zaina!","Let&apos;s face it, Zaina has been convenient and efficient for me, and it&apos;s close to home, so I&apos;ve had a few opportunities to try out their food. At the end of the day, they&apos;ve got me sold with their quickness, their consistency, and the serving sizes of their entrees. 

I&apos;ve mainly had their salads, and tend to go for their beef gyro salad when I have my gyro cravings. I&apos;ll admit - I mainly choose Zaina because their prices aren&apos;t outrageous and as mentioned previously, the portions are good, and, most importantly - the food is pretty tasty. 

However - I wouldn&apos;t give the establishment a solid five-star review, mainly because while the food is tasty, the beef and overall dishes can sometimes lack a certain flair of flavoring and seasoning. I&apos;ve had gyro plates at other places in Seattle, and have experienced more rich and flavorful falafel/gyro/tzatziki plates. 

Nevertheless, I&apos;ll continue to try other dishes at Zaina and value the location for its convenience and tasty meals. Definitely recommended for your lunch needs!","Wow, every time I return to this place I remember why I love it so much. Tasty gyros at a fair price! Since it&apos;s not as easy to dine in these days I usually get my food to go, and it travels well without get soggy. If my fianc√© would let me I&apos;d eat here 3+ x a week.",Best falafel in Seattle...period!!! I&apos;ve been a long time customer since they were in Pioneer Square. Food is always fresh and owners are very friendly.,"Fast and easy meal. Great atmosphere, good service, and tasty food. ;)

I will definitely come back soon. They are well priced and I recommend you try it.",This restaurant worker is very root I don&apos;t recommend people to go there . They take orders and make very very late .,"HOLY MOLY!

Amazing customer service again! That&apos;s a roll!

I had the lamb shawarma plate and my wife had the lamb gyro.

Off the hook with these dishes! Talk about a stuffed gyro...I was looking for the net that held this bad boy together! Must have fallen off when the flavor punched through.

The lamb shawarma plate...it&apos;s like the gyro exploded into perfectly separated portions and they had to use a plate. 

I love what they did to the layout of the joint. There&apos;s some stools along a countertop, then a common area with benches along the walls where everyone can sit and have one huge conversation about how awesome our Seahawks are!

I&apos;m guessing the 3 guys are relatives or just really close friends who have fun here...cause they were fun with us too.

So if you need a bite to eat before waiting in traffic through Lake City Way...go here. It&apos;ll help kill time to let the traffic fade away.",Great place and highly recommend! The falafel sandwiches are delicious here and very filling. The staff is always friendly and definitely always up for a good laugh. Highly recommend this place for great halal food.,Food was good and service was exceptional. Very authentic and just liked the vibe and many options. Will definitely be back!!!,"Mmm, Cedars. We have ordered takeout from this place for years. Hubs and I usually get the chicken tikka (a must-order in my opinion), vegetable jalfrezi and/or vegetable vindaloo with a side order of vegetable samosas and garlic naan.

We&apos;ve ordered from a few Indian places in North Seattle and this one is the best by far. Everything is always delicious and the flavors are consistent. Portions are big - you do not need to order extra rice! Chicken in the tikka is tender and you get a nice assortment of vegetables if you sub those in.

Pick-up time is normally quick too; we ordered on a Saturday night and it was ready within 20 minutes.

If you are in NE Seattle I definitely suggest going to this place! You won&apos;t be disappointed.","Cedars in the University District is amongst one of the oldest Indian restaurants there is.  Unless I&apos;m mistaken, I&apos;m quite certain I had my first bite of Indian food in the Seattle area from this restaurant decades ago.  :)  

After Indian food exploded in the region, I have not returned to Cedars for years, possibly a decade or more.  With the pandemic, I am purchasing food from neighborhood restaurants that are suffering.  The U-District is certainly one of them.  I placed our order via app, and it was ready for pick up in 20 to 25 minutes.

Our Food:  
Mango Curry Chicken - 5 Stars
Chicken saut√©ed with Major Grey Mango Chutney and a touch of cream.
Mango curry in Major Grey have always been a favorite, and this was very satisfying and very delicious.

Rogan Josh Prawns - 4.5 Stars
A famous dish from Kashmir, prawns are cooked with tomatoes and onions then roasted with spices in a rich brown curry sauce.
The flavor of this dish is very potent and flavorful in a beautiful red, brown color.  The 1/2 star less is because prawns can be overcooked when left in the temperature hot sauce.  Because I need to travel some distance to get here, the prawns continue to cook in the hot curry sauce until I am home and eating it.  It was already overcooked by then.  Honestly, I don&apos;t blame them.  They can&apos;t know if someone is walking from a block away or me driving 30+ minutes.  

In any case, both dishes have generous portions.  I fished out the proteins and simmered a bunch of veggies in the curry sauces before adding the proteins back to warm.  So good (and healthier), and each dish became two meals!  They provided lots of rice too!","Already our favorite Indian food pre-pandemic, Cedars has stayed consistent in their quality and the people there are always so kind. We hope to be able to go here for many years to come. 

Our go to order is butter chicken and garlic naan (each single naan is huge, by the way). Their chai is also delicious and so nice on a cold day.","We were coming tired from Snoqualmie at 9pm and then I called Cedar Restaurant and the restaurant guys were very accommodating , there were ready to wait for us  for extra time even though they close at 10. 
When I reached they gave us extra food and cheery on top was their baklava and Falfel plate , it was  delicious .

It&apos;s very hard to find good hearted people and this restaurant have that so it&apos;s definitely worth a try.",Delicious!! Large menu. Like 10 different types of Naan to choose from. all baked fresh.  I will definitely go back for more.,Dinner was delicious! We got the okra dish and veggie tiki masal. Would definitely order again.,"We ordered via Grubhub for the first time. It was good but not our fav. 

We ordered:

-Chicken Vindaloo
-Coconut Chicken Curry
-Palak Paneer 
-Eggplant 
-garlic naan 
-vegetable pakora 
-gulab Jamun

The good. Portions were HUGE.  I was stunned. The chicken dishes were good. The chicken was tender. Garlic naan was good as was the pakora. The dessert was pretty good and a standard gulab jamun. 

Things we didn&apos;t like: the eggplant was smoked/charred which is not the traditional way to make Indian eggplant dishes. It&apos;s the way you make middle eastern dips so perhaps that&apos;s why it was made this way since the restaurant serves both cuisines. It also had an insane amount of peas. The saag paneer was ok but lacked flavor. 

Overall it was ok but I&apos;ve had way better Indian food elsewhere.  It&apos;s worth a try though!",Best Indian food in the udistrict. They always give large quantities and the food is always consistent,"Cedars tries to cover more bases by offering both Indian as well as what it terms &quot;Mediterranean&quot; selections like hummus and falafel, but if you read no other part of this review, stick to the Indian side of the menu and you&apos;ll have the better experience.

I came here with a group as part of a conference at the adjacent University of Washington, and they were very accommodating for our party of 10, including being amiable about our request to split up the bill, which I know must&apos;ve been a bit of a headache. Our food also came out notably fast, in spite of the large group.

I ordered the combination platter with hummus, baba ghannoush, falafel, and pita, all of which was underwhelming. The pita was served cold and tasted store-bought and pulled directly from the fridge, while the falafel was reminiscent of the pre-made dry mix that you can get at the grocery store when you want to attempt making them at home. Thankfully my fellow diners were willing to share some of their Indian dishes, and the quality and flavors were a night and day improvement. If you are a vegetarian, the tandoori paneer is a delicious and surprisingly ungreasy alternative to a meat option, especially when paired with the accompanying grilled vegetables. Veggie pakoras were also scrummy, and the clearly fresh-baked portion of naan was as big as the tablecloth and enjoyed by all. 

The restaurant is a bit worn in, and the restroom could use a bit of sprucing, but overall the dining experience, in terms of the Indian dishes,  was a satisfactory one.","My favorite Indian restaurant in Washington and one of my favorite restaurants in Washington, period. Cedars is so amazing. Everything we&apos;ve tried is consistently top notch. The portion sizes are huge, making this a great value for a family dinner or leftovers. 

We love the samosas, chicken tikka, Mediterranean salad, naan, channa masala, chicken curry, baklava, and more.

They are seriously the sweetest folks, always so kind. We&apos;ve had nothing but great experiences. The quality is so consistent here, too whether delivered or picked up in person.

Toddler &amp; preschooler approved! The whole family will find something to love.","Great Indian food! I&apos;d probably give it 4.5 stars if it were an option, but I&apos;ll round down for this particular review - but I think it&apos;s more of a preference issue than a quality issue.

Ordered butter chicken and palak paneer. Both were decent, though both tasted a little sweet than I prefer/am used to. The other people I ate with loved it though.

One thing we all agreed on was that the garlic naan was amazing. It was HUGE compared to what you get from most places (easily the size of a medium pizza), and tasted delicious to boot.","Cedar&apos;s curry is so good. So flavorful and tangy. They are a level above your average Indian restaurant. The chicken tikka  was flavorful, although it could have been more smoky and tender. The rice as always is cooked perfectly. They do take out wonderfully and are always super friendly. Support them because they definitely deserve to be one of the surviving restaurants!","Solid, tasty, well-portioned Indian comfort food. IMO, the best option of the lot in North Seattle. Naan and Palak Paneer are particularly good here. Support them!",That butter chicken and garlic naan is a match made in heaven!!! Didn&apos;t care much for the falafel (lacked crunch) but I wasn&apos;t there for the falafel in the first place! Sweetest servers ever. Would def come back.,"This place is terrific. I&apos;ve been a long time fan but wanted to reiterate how good my takeout experience was recently. Our order was ready promptly on time and the staff was very friendly. The food was amazing. Aloo Gobi, Navratan Korma, Butter Chicken, and a Spinach Paneer Naan all came out hot and fresh, with amazing flavors and spices. Will be back to support in these tough times!","A group of friends and I ordered takeout from Cedars today. 

The guy who took the order over the phone was a friggin&apos; delight and answered all of my dietary/ingredient questions like a champ. 

When we got there for pickup, the guy at the register was also kind and helpful (may have been the same guy), and also gave us a coupon for free na&apos;an next time!

Food was GREAT. My friends who I was with swear by Cedars (specifically, their butter chicken), but it was my first time. I got the Shish Taouk with veggies. 

All in all, a great experience, especially during this hard time for local restaurants. #coronavirus","Everything I tried was Uuuuhhhhmaaazing. Love the coconut curry, samosas, and the butter chicken. The garlic naan is literally the size of a large pizza. If you go for lunch, the two pieces of naan are more than enough.","We came during dinner time so the prices were a little higher but I know they always have lunch specials and coupons if you&apos;d like to save some money and go during a different time!

The spice level to for sure true to the levels. Stick to what you know and you will be okay!",The best Indian food in Seattle. The owners man&apos;d employees are very friendly and the drive is great. It&apos;s all around an enjoyable place to go if you love Indian food or just trying it for the first time!,"Butter Chicken and garlic naan combo is unbeatable!! Only rating 4 stars because the prices are higher than other places. Garlic naan isn&apos;t very garlicy, but their curry is creamy!","We&apos;ve been wanting to order takeout from the Buddha Bruddah food truck for way too long, so lucky for us they were nearby tonight.  Ordered the Kalua Pork plate and everything was SO good!!! 

The pork was moist and had the perfect level of saltiness, as did the slaw and mac salad. And the rice, topped with their sauce, was also really good  

Plus great portion size.  The only challenge was it was a lot of food and I couldn&apos;t stop eating it. So yep, totally stuffed.  But in a good way","Over the past year, it hasn&apos;t been too often that we&apos;ve treated ourselves to take out food, so we&apos;ve been picky about who we choose. It was great to see the Buddha Bruddah food truck only a few miles from home. We tried the kalhua pork and the spicy pork plates. Both were huge servings and both were really tasty. They do a great job with Covid safety and online ordering is available. It makes me sad not to be able to be on a sandy Hawaiian beach but this comfort food brings the Aloha spirit to the Eastside.","This amazing restaurant is doing quick delivery during the Coronavirus stay at home situation, and I am so happy to have discovered them. Excellent food, great value - we will definitely add them to our regular rotation.","Buddha Bruddah&apos;s food truck came to my neighborhood which was the perfect excuse to get a little variety in our dinner routine during COVID. We ordered ahead online to try and make it as easy as possible and keep socially distanced...etc. They were so busy that our scheduled pick up time was delayed by 30 minutes. It was still a good idea to pre-order because they were so slammed they weren&apos;t even taking walk up orders when we arrived. With all of this I was expecting an unforgettable dinning experience but I think people just wanted something a little different on a Friday night during a pandemic. The food was hit and miss for me. The Huli Huli Chicken was pretty good paired with the mac salad and Asian slaw that came with it. Im not usually a Katsu person but BB&apos;s take was surprisingly solid and it held up nicely considering we didn&apos;t eat it until about 45 minutes after picking it up. Fried food doesn&apos;t always work that way but this did and the chicken was juicy. Skip the Phad Thai! This was a flavorless disaster. There was nothing so memorable that I would go out of my way for this truck but if it was in the area again, and the wait wasn&apos;t insane, I would probably order a chicken dish and get my plate lunch fix. 

Pros
Online ordering
Good mac salad
Great sesame slaw

Cons
Avoid the Phad Thai at all costs","Our community hosted the Buddha Bruddah food truck today. The staff was friendly and the food was right on time (we ordered ahead) - we ordered the Kalaua Pork , phad thai and spicy pork. Soooooo good - get the Kalaua Pork if anything !!!! The Mac salad was so good and made me miss our yearly trips to Oahu..
You should absolutely check them out !","Don&apos;t bother order online ahead, it&apos;s useless. They&apos;re not organized and we were told both of the items in our order were out of stock even we order a few hours ahead. They don&apos;t even apologize","Food was tasty and reasonably priced! I would recommend if you&apos;re near the area but not worth to drive out of your way for. The food isn&apos;t very spicy, but it has great flavor! Service is also excellent","If I had to imagine the perfect restaurant concept, this might very well be it.  Real, delicious, and hearty food, from a business to support.  

Generous portions of plate lunches with a wider range of protein options than usual.  Kalua pork was fantastic.  Flavors of mains and sides are on point.  Also, don&apos;t forget the host of sauces ready to bathe your plate in added flavors.  Honestly one of the best food trucks around, so get you a plate! Can&apos;t wait to head down to the brick and mortar soon.","I don&apos;t recommend eating from the food truck; the chicken made my daughter and I sick: I vomited, we both had diarrhea and felt sick/headaches for about ten hours. We reported it to the County; I&apos;m certain it was from their food.

My daughter&apos;s friend ordered the pork and it looked terrible, I think they gave her a crappy scoop of leftovers or something; I wished we&apos;d opened the container at pickup before walking off with it. It was NOT quality meat. The friend at least had the foresight to throw her meal away instead of eating it, so she wasn&apos;t sickened. 

Aside from that it&apos;s just not good value; it&apos;s mostly rice and their noodle salad, which did not inspire. 

I know they&apos;ve got plenty of good reviews; but for my part I&apos;ll never buy from them again.","Flavors are out of this world. One of the best things is I can&apos;t find any restaurant or food truck I&apos;ve been to that cones close to offering the dishes they do at the same level of flavor, portions, and price. The sauce collection is top of the line too and the seaweed seasoning is a must. The Hulu Hulu Ginger Chicken is my go to and the Mac salad is the best I&apos;ve ever had. Keep up the amazing work!","I&apos;m so happy to have found this place!! 
Ironically, we stumbled upon this gem after trying a different restaurant earlier, that had such bad customer service, that we walked out without ordering. (And I&apos;m actually really easy going!)
My boyfriend had heard good things, and so we stopped in at the restaurant. The vibe alone was so welcoming, &amp; the food was DELICIOUS!
And large portions. I can&apos;t wait to go back and work my way down the menu! 
I should also add: the macaroni salad is the best I&apos;ve ever had... thank you so much. I can&apos;t wait to be a &quot;regular&quot;! Mahalo","Saw this food truck parked in downtown at 5th &amp; Union area, so I thought I&apos;d check them out. I haven&apos;t eaten at a food truck in a long time so why not.  Walked up about noon, there was no line but there were about 8 bros waiting for their food. 

I decided to just pick one of their mixed plates and got the Hawaiian Grilled Beef. Comes with 2 scoops of rice, mac salad and Asian slaw. Lady yelled to the cook my order and mentioned it was an &quot;easy plate&quot; which meant that my food would come out real quick. 

The food was good, not the most flavorful in my book but it was fine for lunch. Beef is cut on the thicker side so it may not look like a whole lot of beef in your box. Beef is already pre-cooked so it wasn&apos;t the most tender, some parts were a little dry. Marinade was ok, wish is was more flavorful, Asian slaw was i-ight, mac salad was actually pretty good where I could eat a large tub of it. 

Food did come out pretty quick, I only waited a few minutes, all they had to do was to plate it up in the to-go box for me as everything was already cooked &amp; ready. They have a hot sauce station to jazz up your box. Prices are about $11+ so yea it&apos;s on the higher side. They will yell out your name when your food is ready just in case you are busy staring at your phone.

Glad I checked them out, overall it was just ok to good, if I see them on the streets again, may stop by again and try some other items.",So ono delicious! Loved the huli huli chicken and Mac salad. The best spicy sauces around!! Love this spot.,"No vegetarian options.  Modification not available.

Read the menu on the Pad Thai with Tofu and stood in line anyway.  Cashier confirmed that there would be egg and fish sauce and didn&apos;t sound like I could skip either.  I&apos;m not a strict vegetarian so I placed an order anyway.

2 stars for food being hot and freshly made.  Noodles were a bit too sweet for me but that&apos;s pretty standard for Pad Thai.  Egg was in large pieces of odd thin sheets, also too sweet which was disappointing.

Would be really good if vegetarian and vegan options are available or available as a modification.  Other trucks offer skipping the egg.  Not sure why skipping the fish sauce may be problematic as I recently discovered that some Thai places put fish sauce in their &quot;vegetarian&quot; dishes.",My first time trying the food truck was not so pleasant and food was okay. Owner reached out and did a good job of addressing my review. I would love to try the restaurant next.,"I have seen this truck in Seattle before, but usually there is a line and rarely are we hanging out in Seattle for too long. I had the opportunity to try this truck while at the washington brewers fest in redmond. The food smelled amazing and I have wanted to try them for a while. 
My wife got the phad thai while grabbed the spicy pork. Both dishes were amazing. One way to really judge the quality of a Hawaiian joint in the macaroni salad. They had a really good one. Sometimes places will have a little too much onion in it, but this one was just right, slightly sweet and just a right amount of tang. The food we had was really good. Next time I see these guys in Seattle I will definitely make a stop.","I should of read the reviews before buying lunch from them. 

I just ordered the phad thai and it isn&apos;t as delicious as it smells. The tofu isn&apos;t fried or precooked, still raw. The noodles were dunked into hot boiling water then emerged into phad thai sauce and then tossed over high heat. This isn&apos;t phad thai at all. So save you $10 and invest it else where.",Finally checked this place out yesterday! Very tasty Larb Gai and nice strong Thai iced coffee. Great fun atmosphere. Really liked the variety of fresh hot sauces...I wimped out and went for the 2 star one with fish sauce. YUM!,One of the Seattle&apos;s best tasting mix plates!! YUM!!,"I use the Peach service to order lunch at work. I had never heard of Buddha Bruddah or Huli Huli chicken, but I was intrigued by the photo and description, so decided to try it out and one happy tummy later, I have no regrets! :)
The chicken had a unique flavor and cooked to perfection! I&apos;m now following them on Facebook to see when can I try other items on their menu!","So glad we found this spot! We needed a beer and tv access for the game and wow they defiantly have both those! From our seats we could see probably about 6-7 different TVs and most of the restaurant seemed that way so not a bad seat in the house! We got wings to share, the pterodactyl wings. They were spicy but not crazy spicy which I think for most people is enough. Drinks were cold and delish! Also the service was AMAZING!! We notice there was maybe 2-3 girls running the whole place and they were killing it! Never let me sit with my drink empty or with dirty plates on the table. We can&apos;t wait to come back for a real meal because the menu looked great! Highly recommend!","My 25th High School Reunion was hosted here. While I wouldn&apos;t naturally pick this place, I still liked it! I enjoyed the fried chicken and waffles with honey butter and syrup. 

The porter was a rotating tap, and it was fantastic with my food. 

The room we were in offered skeet ball, 1980 Miracle On Ice stand up hockey game, and Ms. PAC Man.","I really like the Westy.  It&apos;s a great neighborhood bar.  The ambiance is updated and comfortable.  There are TV&apos;s and some games in the back.  For me, the food is a level above standard pub grub.  It&apos;s made well and offers fresher twists and options than the traditional grease menu of many bars.  The drinks are well made, and there&apos;s a nice choice of cocktails, traditional straight liquors, and a nice selection of beer.  We really like the bartender who is very friendly, and the service is great.  The happy hour is an additional enticement.","I&apos;m not sure why it took me so long to finally check out The Westy, but boy am I glad I did! My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday for brunch during the Seahawks game, and it was about half full an hour before kickoff. It quickly turned into a full house about half an hour before the game, so I definitely recommend getting there early for games. It&apos;s a perfect sports bar setup, with TVs in basically every direction.

I had the Westy burger with waffle fries, and the fries truly blew me away. They were PERFECT in every way, and portions were extremely generous. The burger was fine, but I personally thought the patty was too thick (and I&apos;m truly just being picky here). Boyfriend&apos;s French Toast &amp; Bacon was great, and we loved the mimosa pitcher!

Our server was super attentive and checked in with us multiple times throughout our visit. I&apos;m dying to come back and take advantage of the Happy Hour and try some of their wings!","Thursday night football, drinks, and bar food. 

Great pretzel bites! Comes with mustard and cream cheese dip. The dip I think was cream cheese, cheddar cheese and some jalapeno. 

Tater tots were super crispy and perfect bar food to enjoy some sports. Comes with a chipotle mayo.

Very large venue with plenty of room for big groups.",The happy hour here is a great value. The venue is clean and welcoming. The service was personable and efficient for a bar setting. The black bean burger was a great entree that was full of flavor and had a good amount of fresh veggie toppings. The drinks were well made and full of flavor. All in all a great dinner and dining experience.,"The westy is great! Local bar with friendly service. The food is good, eaten here a handful of times and always pleased. It&apos;s such a great bar for sports. So many TVs! Buuuut sooooo busy! They&apos;re so popular now which is bad for me but so great and well deserved for them.","Woohoo!  A new awesome restaurant in our area. Thank God the Roosevelt Ale House hasn&apos;t reopened or we might not have found this gem. 

Went here about a week ago after seeing a matinee movie near Northgate. Thank God for Yelp for helping us find it.  

Parking is a bit of a challenge here. Street parking out front limited depending on time of day. Parking lot in back doesn&apos;t seem to offer any spots for the restaurant. We parked one street back in front of a house. I feel sorry for homeowners in this area. 

Very friendly server. Thought he could have even been a manager or owner. Very helpful and energetic. We chose to split a banh mi sandwich with tots and order of Wings. Everything perfectly delicious!  Was initially afraid of their Pterodactyl hot sauce because of the name but it is fabulous!  

Look forward to going back soon and trying more menu items. Noticed the latest Val-Pak mailer had a coupon for them.","Solid sports bar - a much needed addition to Ravenna!! My friend and I were looking for a spot to watch the game and I had driven by The Westy numerous times without ever stopping in. We decided to give it a go today as they have lots of great tvs for games. We were a little worried that there was a line out the door before kickoff, but fortunately most of the folks were there for a different game. We easily got a spot at the bar in front of a beautiful tv for the hawks game and spent the next 3 hours enjoying the food, drink, and excellent game on tv. My friend lives all the way out in Mukilteo and said she would be willing to come out here again to watch the game with me - whoo hoo!! That says a lot about how great our experience was here. My veggie scramble was really good - full of protein. I ordered the Morningstar veggie sausage patties on the side in case I needed any additional protein but I most certainly did not. I could barely finish the meal as it was super filling - but I definitely enjoyed every last bit of it. Looking forward to future visits!","I so wanted to love it here, but man I just can&apos;t say that is the truth. I have found bones in my chicken tacos, had overdressed salads, burnt fried chicken and broccoli that tasted like melted plastic.   Not sure what is going on, their sister restaurant in West Seattle never disappointed but this one is not cutting it for us. We have tried it about 8 times Only once were we happy. 

The one thing that is consistent is their drinks, that is why I gave 3 not two stars.  Parking can also be a pain. Sorry guys. Let us know if you switch it up. I REALLY want to like it here.","I love coming here in the summer when I can sit with my dog at the &quot;outdoor bar&quot;. Inside it is super kid friendly. The food is alright. The drinks are reasonably priced. Still, this is a great addition to the neighborhood.","Best wings in Seattle that I&apos;ve had. 

Unfortunately the service is below par. I came on a busy night as well as a slower night and my experience was similar. Slow service, condescending waiters, and overall lack of care. I don&apos;t like to feel like I am bothering someone when I ask for water, another beer, or a check. A large sigh never makes anyone feel welcome. The first time I went the waiter forgot my order. When I asked about the status, they claimed I had never ordered food....... I had only ordered one item. The guy looked at me like I was crazy, when he was the one taking the order.

I will go back but to the other location even though it is more of a drive.",How can anything be wrong with a restaurant that serves tater tots? The sandwiches and burgers are great.....flavorful and juicy.  The French Fries are skinny and crispy. It&apos;s a pretty chill atmosphere and the service is good. I recommend coming here.,"My wife and I were visiting a good friend in Seattle for the weekend and stumbled upon The Westy Roosevelt.  The Westy is a must visit by both locals and visitors.
Expansive menu that caters to everyone&apos;s dietary needs (vegan, vegetarian, keto, etc...).  The food is phenomenal with hearty portions.  Additionally, the staff is super friendly and extremely attentive, especially Kaitlyn and J.P.  We had an absolute blast and I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant to anyone seeking great food and friendly service!","The server was so rude I ended up leaving. To start, I was joining a party of five with a friend. I understand and respect rules due to Covid, I work in customer service myself. My friends that already had a table saved us one near them. When we got there, the server/host took us to the table that was saved for my friend and I. We took to long to sit and she rudely and aggressively told us to sit due to rules and regulations. Without hesitation we sat down. She continued to tell us that only one person could sit at the table she just took us to. I was confused and asked to clarify because she just took two people to a table and is now yelling at us that we could only have one person. Why did you seat us there? She also proceeded to try and split us up. We weren&apos;t against moving tables but to try and have a pair sit separately? Then she had the audacity to ask if I was giving her attitude for clarifying how many people could sit there followed by &quot;you can leave&quot;. Without hesitation I was already on my way out. I will never go back nor will any of us ever recommend.","Awesome bar space with loads of TVs, appropriate for minors until 10pm.  Had the Westy Classic, very tasty, cooked just right, juicy and with a spicy kick due to the special sauce.  Service was very friendly and accommodating","Great staff. Very delicious food. I love the wings. Always a very cool , comfortable, &amp; inviting environment.","We came to watch some college football and were having a great time. Our waiter was short with us, but we were trying to overlook this. In the middle of our meal we had a hard time getting our waiter Chris&apos; attention to let him know that he had forgotten to bring part of our order. When one of us tapped him on the arm he went crazy and got in our face to the point it was very uncomfortable. At that point we just wanted to leave.","My go to for good beer, great food &amp; great service. Always a good time with great conversations. Late night menu is awesome!","These five stars are completely for the staff. Just in tonight for the election night party, and these folks were hustling to the max in a super hectic, packed crowd. In another place I would have been waiting forever at the bar given the number of people, but I wasn&apos;t here. Thank
you Westy staff for the hard work!","Note that Finn&apos;s is temporarily CLOSED due to COVID. This review is for before COVID regulations were enforced.

My college experience wouldn&apos;t have been the same without Finn&apos;s. My friends and I would come here almost every Wednesdays for cheap Wells drinks (Wells Wednesday). The prices would alternate between $1 &amp; $2 depending on the hour, so we would come here at 11pm for peak hour and $1 drinks. Their Wells selection includes rum, tequila, vodka, (and I think gin?) with a choice of orange juice, soda, cranberry juice, pineapple juice, or ginger beer (+$2) for mix-in. Our main go-tos were vodka cranberries and tequila sunrises. The bartenders are all pretty heavy handed, so make sure to mix the drinks well!

Out of all of the bars on The Ave, Finn&apos;s is the darkest, loudest, and probably the most crowded. Make sure to arrive early to grab a table. If you want to have a conversation with your friend sitting next to you, you&apos;re either going to have to shout or just pretend and smile and nod haha. Finn&apos;s is also the only bar with a dance floor so there&apos;s usually a lot of action going on.

Service is okay. It can be difficult to get the bartender&apos;s attention because people just crowd around the bar so you have to be patient.

In summary, Finn&apos;s is a place for quality over quantity, so don&apos;t expect anything too fancy for $1; come here just to get tipsy with friends and mingle with the college crowd.

Hopefully Finn&apos;s will open up again once corona subsides.

Overall: 3/5 for drinks, 3/5 for service, 3/5 for atmosphere","Eh. Came here for one of their karaoke nights. The smell is quite nauseating. Alcohol is decently priced. The singing could have been better. Nothing too special about the place, just a loud Irish bar in middle of a university district. Hopefully that last sentence is more than enough to provide a sufficient mental image of this place in your head.",Cool Irish pub in the heart of the &quot;Ave&quot; in the University district. The smell of spilled beer set me back when I walked in. I don&apos;t believe this place has ever seen hot water and bleach. It would have been enough to make me turn around except for the fact that it was the U district. I wanted a beer and some food. Choices for that combo are fairly slim on the Ave. I will have to hunt around for a better smelling place next time. Good service and the Ruben was fantastic.,"This place is in business solely because of their ability to profit off of college kids who don&apos;t care if they&apos;re treated horribly while getting a pitcher of beer. Have received extremely rude service on multiple occasions. This last occasion Included the server calling my friends bag &quot;trash&quot; shouting at us to throw away water bottles that &quot;could be filled with vodka&quot; despite not bringing out waters... and literally throwing our cards in our face when it was time to leave. I can&apos;t make this stuff up. We are grad students who come here every Thursday for school events, but now, we will be telling all our friends to avoid this place like the plague. If you want to be treated like trash, Finn&apos;s is your place!","We were headed to a show at the Neptune Theater &amp; decided to stop in to have a drink. It&apos;s definitely a bit of a dive bar but the service from Sofia was great! We only had drinks, no food, but they were all good. She was the only one attending the place and kept up with it all. We would stop in again when in town.","Their food is SOLID here.
And SERIOUSLY, how can you beat a CORNED BEEF Quesadilla!??!
The employees are friendly, too.
But if you&apos;re a dick, don&apos;t expect to walk all over them.
Sooooo yeah, don&apos;t be a dick.",I come here on and off and always have a good time.  The bartenders work hard and are always nice.  The guy working last night was very attentive even while busy.  Wanted to post because I got food here that was sooo good.  Sunday night is 1/2 off pizza and drinks.  The barbeque pizza was gooey cheesy goodness.  It also packed incredible flavor.   Hats off to the chef.,"If you&apos;re coming here, you&apos;re probably coming here for Wells Wednesday. It&apos;s the extremely chaotic, ever-popular, entirely packed night of the week where Finn MacCool&apos;s offers all of their well cocktails for $1 and $2&apos;s, during different portions of the night. The lines for this place can sometimes stretch down the block, especially if it&apos;s the first or last week of a quarter. Getting in can take what feels like an eternity, and once you get in it&apos;s hard to actually make your way to either the bar or the dance floor because the bar is over flowing with college students.

The price of admission is free, and the drinks are dirt cheap, so it&apos;s worth it in some senses. But Finn MacCool&apos;s is more akin to a club on Wednesday nights than a pub (which is in the name), and you should be prepared for that. 

Tip: Spare a few extra bucks for your bartender, college students. Especially on Wednesday nights, they are overworked and easily deserve more.","Cheapest drinks in town, conscientious bartenders, good food at reasonable prices, decent music, convenient location... I can&apos;t say anything negative about this Irish dive and the positives really add up!","Not to be that person, but I genuinely wish I could give this bar zero stars. I went there last night for the first time. Atmosphere: acceptable at best. Not an Irish pub vibe, just a bunch of colored lights, crap music played so loud you can&apos;t hear yourself think, etc. Typical college bar in U District that probably used to be cool and unique but has crumbled under the pressure of college kids demanding a dance floor. That was actually fine I hardly cared. The issue I had was with the bartender who would not take my order. I went up, asked for a food menu because I had just gotten off work and was starving and this -god I wish you could swear on yelp- uh woman, rolled her eyes harder than I imagine Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson&apos;s biceps are before hurriedly plopping the menu in front of me, only to leave me hanging for at least 25 minutes while she took everyone&apos;s orders but mine. I literally left my boyfriend to hold my spot so I could stand in line for the bathroom for 10 minutes only to come back to her mixing drinks for people who had definitely not even been at the bar before I left. I flagged her down, she rolled her eyes and served the people BEHIND me. I can&apos;t even call it bad service because I actually just didn&apos;t get service at all. Needless to say, I left, and went to Shultzy&apos;s down the street, leaving my entire group behind because they evidently still wanted to give this establishment their money after us all not getting any service for what had now turned into almost 40 minutes. Had some wine and some food and amazing service at Shultzy&apos;s because they actually are a good place to be. Finn McCool&apos;s has been my worst bar experience in all of Seattle. I work in food service and have worked in food service a long time and I usually tip around 50% but I&apos;m not going to even pay for a drink at a place that would hire a bartender who refuses to even take my order for so long. That was just ridiculous like y&apos;all get it together !","Terrible. This place used to be super fun, but some new staff members have recently made the place horrible. Brandon is literally the rudest bartender, and the waitress that works with him is on one as well. We went on a Thursday night, and it&apos;s usually popping for kareoke. It was empty, so we found a table and waited for ten minutes. Nobody came and took our order. After we finally flagged someone down, the waitress acted like we were in the wrong. Um what? Brandon came over and told my friend she needed to get rid of her water bottle immediately. My friend said it was just water, and he said it doesn&apos;t matter it could be vodka. That&apos;s fair, however, we wouldn&apos;t even be in this situation if y&apos;all had just brought us waters and menus lmao. Decided to leave before we even ordered. Bartender Brandon needs some serious training on how to manage. How is a place literally empty and the service is still terrible!? Soft.",Very comfortable place to have a drink with friends. Server was attentive without being pushy. Recommend!,"Had been here on the weekend before St Patty&apos;s expecting it to be packed and happening. This place was empty, with just four tables occupied. This place does not give you the feeling of an Irish bar at all.

The place is reasonably large, with a bar just as your enter, and a big sitting room after that. However, there isn&apos;t any evidence of they trying to decorate the bar at all. They have basic tables and chairs, and seems to be a more like a frat-frequented place. They have a karaoke stage at the end. 

We were a large group, and our server showed no interest in being friendly, and acted like he was there against his will. The cocktails &amp; drinks were tasty, but felt like they cheap out on the alcohol. Other places have generous pours, but not this one.

The prices aren&apos;t too bad, and they have good happy hour specials on certain days, as well as food specials late night. The food isn&apos;t great, but not bad either. Nachos were decent.

I wouldn&apos;t come back except when they have drink specials. I&apos;d rather go to other places on the ave, which have stronger drinks and a better vibe.","Our first meal in Seattle, walking from our hotel... we were told about this pub and glad we found it.
Caprese salad is done nicely.
The corned beef is yummy - I wish they put more beef on the plate! (Even one more slice would be good.)
Drinks = good!
Fruit flies at the bar = not so good.
Still... come! It&apos;s a pub, so not upscale. If you want a decent little pub, this place will treat you well.","Let me tell you how hilariously stupid this story is.

I&apos;ve been to this bar multiple times for months now. Never have I had a problem with a door bouncer until tonight.

My fianc√© and our 2 friends get in line to go into the bar like any other night we&apos;ve been here. A red-headed bearded bouncer is rushing everyone through with an attitude and we are up next. The guy checks my ID and is telling people to move to give him elbow space and is flailing his arms around and almost elbows a dude leaving the bar. I simply said &quot;Cmon man&quot;. I&apos;m just trying to get into this bar and chill with my friends. 

The line to get in was already long and is now piling up way outside the door in 40 degree weather. This dude decides the best way to do his job is try to flex his ego and hold up EVERYBODY so he can tell me &quot;how hard his job is&quot;. You&apos;re looking at IDs and almost elbowed a dude in the face. You almost fucked up LOOKING AT IDs. Pretty tough job I&apos;d say. 

Bouncer guy then proceeds to stamp my arm and as I&apos;m walking by he wants to flex his ego one more time by telling me &quot;you should learn some respect&quot;. My last comment to this dude is &quot;you need to earn it&quot; as I&apos;m almost in the bar. Our hero then decides to stop me completely and tell me to &quot;get out of his bar&quot;. I ask him &quot;for what reason?&quot; And the dude says I have an attitude and he doesn&apos;t want me here. He runs the bar. He owns it I guess. Really great impression of an owner. This guy was already slow at checking my ID in the first place. Now he&apos;s trying to get someone else over so he can escort me out. The whole time people are cold as shit waiting in line outside the bar. I offer our genius an alternative by saying I&apos;ll wait on the side here while you check IDs. I don&apos;t want to hold up the line because of this guy. He repeatedly says &quot;no, you need to get out or I&apos;ll escort you out.&quot; At this point I didn&apos;t even care for going in anymore, but just wanted to tell the irony of the story to the person running the bar. After about a minute of him refusing my offer to wait on the side while he gets someone I just leave. The last thing I tell our ID checking savant is &quot;I&apos;m not doing this for you, but I don&apos;t want to hold the line because of you.&quot; Ironic that a door bouncer who rushes people decides the best option is to hold everyone up while he flaunts his ego.

You want to become a better bar instantly then I suggest you get rid of the egomaniac at your door. Nobody had a problem until he started it. I hope his bouncer career takes him to greater heights because you know...looking at IDs is so difficult.","Was not sure about this place as the reviews were weak. Since most restaurants in the area are Asian in nature and we had already had Asian food, we were in the mood for something else. We needed a quick bite before class started. The ambiance was typical of an Irish Pub urban experience for college students.

Glad we gave them a chance. It was a Tuesday at 5 PM and they offered $6.00 appetizers and $2.00 tacos. All of the food was very good! Coconut shrimp, mozzarella sticks, hot wings, tacos and wedge salad all hit the spot for three people with eclectic cravings. Service was very good and I would definitely return, especially during happy hour on a Tuesday! The food was truly satisfying with no question. Hot fudge brownie and ice cream was a great way to end the meal!","The service was so bad. Don&apos;t order food here, unless if you want to wait 1 hour for a chicken sandwich.. plus it was not even tasty. Definitely not coming to this place again","Great location, decent drinks, not so awesome food. They have a lot of specials at this bar and it is a good spot to meet up with college friends after hours.  It has a dive bar feel to it and is probably not the place to eat good food. You will probably find regulars here because of its great location on the ave. There is even a small outdoor patio area where people especially like to hang out in the summer when it is warm out.  You will most definitely get carded at this bar, as there is a bouncer as you enter.",Really appreciated he bartender (female Sunday night 6/102018)   She was very helpful and nice.  Good choices very on hiring her.  Great personality and customer service .   Which lacks these days.    Food was good.  But service can seal or break the deal for me and she did awesome.,"I went here with a couple of friends. We had Irish Nachos and the Fries, neither of which was particularly great. Thankfully, we had a pitcher of lager to wash it down with. The service wasn&apos;t anything to remember either.","Yummy neighborhood breakfast/brunch restaurant! I have driven by and wanted to have breakfast here since my first visit to Seattle as an adult 12 years ago. I almost ended up renting an apartment right above them for a year but then didn&apos;t and missed my opportunity to eat here on the regular. One of my neighbors on NextDoor recommended them and I put them on my list to finally try! And I&apos;m so glad I did! My friend and I ordered takeout from the car and even though Yelp/GrubHub said it was going to take an hour, it was ready well before then. I do wish they would send a message through the app when the order is ready so you&apos;re not left wondering while you wait in your car. 

I had the huevos rancheros and split the homemade cinnamon roll with my friend. They give you the choice of how you want your eggs cooked, which is nice, except I didn&apos;t know how huevos rancheros eggs are supposed to be cooked so I selected Sunny side up. Whoops! The order came out looking like three sunny side up eggs on tortillas. They obviously didn&apos;t want everything to get mushy in transit but the flip side of that was that I had to throw together the meal the way I imagined it was supposed to look and it didn&apos;t look as appetizing as huevos rancheros usually does! Luckily it tasted really good! And I loved that their fruit cup came with blueberries and delicious grapes, rather than just the standard melon and grapes. The homemade cinnamon roll was very good and I would definitely come back for that. It&apos;s also plenty for two people to share. 

Unfortunately they don&apos;t have an outdoor space for seating - but there is an empty pub parking lot directly adjacent where a tiny coffee stand has popped up. On a nice day I&apos;d be happy to sit in camping chairs in this lot and enjoy food from this restaurant. Maybe they can work something out with Flying Boots to make use of their unused lot in the mornings!","DURING COVID
Visited on a Monday just after opening back up for limited seating due to COVID.  Again, it was a Monday, so we didn&apos;t have a wait to get a table.  Not sure that it would be the same on a weekend because this place is a great neighborhood eatery for a leisurely breakfast.  The service was attentive and friendly.  We had an omelette that came with hash browns and toast and also had an order of french toast.  The portions were more than generous and the food was delicious.  Many breakfast options are available including Bennedicts, Country fried steak, and biscuits and gravy to name a few.  They were taking precise precautions with cleaning, distancing, and menus were paper menus for one time use.  Looking forward to a return visit to try some other options.  Thank you for being there!",During My stay in Seattle area we enjoyed this little beauty. Home cooked food. I liked They&apos;re delightful way to deal with Covid and social distancing. Owner was  on site and very helpful.,I realized I reviewed the wrong Varisty! Sorry Varisty in Wallingford. I got this breakfast last weekend and it&apos;s the best chicken fried steak. Melts in your mouth. Not chewy or grisly. The gravy is fantastic. It&apos;s gravy a grandma would make. This is my new go to chicken friend steak spot! The fruit cup was beautifully put together too.,"I very rarely write bad reviews, but man... this was a disappointing, overpriced, &amp; slow experience. Staff arguing with each other, manager being snappy at the GrubHub delivery guy... Not sure how I walked out spending almost $50 on diner food, but I do know it wasn&apos;t worth the wait &amp; the food was below average. Our coffee was refilled 3 times before we got our food, to give some perspective on how long it took. I watched people place to-go orders in person &amp; receive their food before us, then after every to-go order is filled the manager says &quot;You guys are up next.&quot; after we&apos;ve been sitting there for 30+ minutes. It looked like a nice diner that maybe I would frequent more often, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be coming back. I hope they fix their efficiency and pricing issues.",Super delicious omelets and great service from Heidi! The Bacon Cinnamon roll is to die for and it might be slightly expensive but still worth it to get a nice breakfast for 2! Would definitely come back!,"I ordered here through a delivery app that totally messed up - however Ravenna Varsity Restaurant was above and beyond amazing about it. I didn&apos;t even call them first, they called me and apologized (even though it 100% not their fault, it was the delivery service) and said they contacted the delivery company, made a new breakfast (the old one had been sitting there for an hour) and got a new driver was going to pick it up. Not only that they called me to reassure me when the driver had picked up the order. It was excellent customer service and I was blown away.","Love this small cafe friendly service, the cinnamon rolls oh man have goody good.  I had a nice burger and fries with a authentic ice tea.","The sweet potato hash was wonderful. Will definitely be back. 

I&apos;m sort of shocked at the other reviews, this is a family-owned diner, if you wanted fancy, you should have chosen Salare and enjoyed your gold-flaked P√¢te √† Choux (also amazing).","The reason behind all the below average reviews? I say it roots in the weak management  at this restaraunt. I couldn&apos;t help but observe the frantic emotions of the staff and what looked like the owner/manager of the restaraunt. 

Came in for brunch around 10am. Got our orders in, got our food, but I was distracted by everything else going around. They made a 10+ long table-top in the center and one of the servers was telling the &quot;owner&quot; that there needs to be a pathway flow between the tables and the &quot;owner&quot; didnt acknowledge that. And I agree with the server. If you need to serve and exit in emergency, this giant long table would be in the way!

Customers coming in didn&apos;t get welcomed and waited for a long time. Guests sat themselves and didn&apos;t get menus and had to mooch off a table nearby.

The &quot;owner&quot; frantically moving around almost knocked down a chair and coat hanger. Several workers in the front didnt look happy and were just doing their job setting up tables and bussing. You had a few servers who were nice, our server was nice, but you cant help but watch the chaos behind the scenes.

Oh, And the food? It was okay. My eggs were too scrambled, waffle was a waffle - nothing too special. I&apos;d prefer Bryant&apos;s Corner around the corner (haha).","OK...I am happy to pay penance for my old and not too favorable review.  First...over the last ten years the service has improved...or maybe I&apos;ve just learned to put up with it!!!  And the food is always always good.  Great sandwiches,  perfectly cooked omelets and Cottage Cheese Pancakes.  Ever had those?  All they are are buttermilk pancakes with cottage cheese added to the batter...but they are great!  Come out nice and brown and really moist  like a cross between pancakes and blintzes...yum!  

Plus they have really good salmon sandwiches and made-to-order egg salad...another of my faves!  

Certainly one of the best breakfasts in the north end...if the service is a little slow,  be patient!  If I can,  so can you!!!","Had breakfast there this morning and seemingly due to the time change it was a packed restaurant with just one waitress and one cook.  They both killed it though!  Awesome service and great food.  Crayons for my daughter, refills on my coffee and a delicious breakfasts for my wife and I!","I live in the neighborhood and have a like/hate relationship with this restaurant. It&apos;s good if you like mediocre diner food, bland taste, and a bit overdone. The wait for the food is always long. The customer service is shit. You can refill my drinks all you want but the waitresses dont care about you. MY waitress flew out of the kitchen as I was walking to the restroom and almost knocked into me if I didnt stop. Didnt even notice I was there. I probably wont stop in again.","The review would have been 3 stars but the prices are INSANELY high for breakfast. A family of 5 (3 kids under 7) was $75 with 20% tip. That&apos;s $15/person. The kids were starving and we went into the first place we saw. The staff was quite cold and while the food was good, the muffin was clearly frozen and reheated in a microwave. Who knew a diner could cost so much?!","Simply incredible, I have made it a tradition every Friday to eat there. Pancakes are simply amazing and I love how it is family owned!!!","I like the homey diner vibe at this place and comfy booths. The service is friendly but slow. However, the food is not good. I went with my husband on a weekday morning. Here&apos;s what we had:

Cinnamon roll- Just ok, not worth going back for.

Homestyle waffle combo - Eggs were dry and the bacon was ancient. It tasted like oil used a hundred times and was dry and tough. The waffle was the worst though. It was like lightly baked doughy bread. Not at all crispy, not fluffy or light. Not even flavorful. Just bad. And slightly salty. This was served with faux maple syrup.

Some sort of scramble - This was my husband&apos;s dish so I can&apos;re remember the actual name but he didn&apos;t like it. 

Too bad because I love a place that serves breakfast/brunch on a weekday. We won&apos;t be back.","We were from out of town staying in an Airbnb in the neighborhood and we ended up eating breakfast here all three days.  The food is great, but the star is the cinnamon buns. The management/owner and her family treated us like family after literally two minutes of sitting down.  We will always come back to this place when we visit Seattle again.  Don&apos;t listen to the negative reviews, visit this place.","Wow....is all I have to say! We left with out getting our order after waiting nearly an hour. If I could give this place negative stars I would! Terri was our server, or should I say our non-existent server. When we first sat we waited almost 10 minutes while she talked to her only table to even get a drink order from us. While waiting numerous other tables were seated. As the food finally started coming out for the restaurant, 6 tables that came in after us all got their food. As we were getting up to leave, Terri met us at the register and said our food was coming up next. Seriously, next?!?! What happened? Oh, I know, Terri was too busy being chatty, and sharing pictures with one table, and was completely oblivious to all her other tables!!! If you have hours to kill, this is the place to be!!!!",Excellent eggs and wonderful hash browns. Great diner food!,"Ok, I can&apos;t give the Varsity five stars. It&apos;s a diner for crying out loud. It is a five star diner though! 

I&apos;ve been coming here for years. Like 30. Now I cross town to come here. 

Get to know the wait staff. Sometimes you get served by a high school student who is learning how to work hard, sometimes it is the owner or one of her daughters... It is a bit of small town in the big city. 

If you come by on a Friday say hi,  I&apos;ll be in my booth digging into my country Benedict. 

And tell Sandy that Greg sent you!","I bought an Alley Cat sandwich in the Harborview Hospital cafeteria today. Harborview carries sandwiches from local sandwich places much to the delight of the people who work at Harborview. I had Alley Cat&apos;s &quot;Caprese Sandwich.&quot; TOTALLY delicious! I Low moisture mozzarella on a perfect como loaf. Fresh sliced tomatoes and a little pesto. I don&apos;t know exactly what was in it--I didn&apos;t examine it, I just ATE it! Thanks Alley Cat!","Came in from out of town! First time at this restaurant and the ramen was outstanding! Definitely recommend! Looked up this ramen spot and decided to go here, extremely worth it! Our server was amazing! He filled our drinks before they were empty and provided amazing service!","Their ramen is ok, and I think it&apos;s not as good as what other people described. The soup has pork smell (which I&apos;m not used to), and it&apos;s a bit too salty.","Picture of food: 5/5
Taste of food: 3/5
Price: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Wait time: 3.5/5 
Not too many options if you&apos;re vegetarian or vegan, and they charge extra if you want to switch out a chicken/pork broth for a vegetarian broth 

I checked in with a friend because I saw that offered Naruto toppings (I&apos;m pescatarian), which are fish cakes but that was about it","First impressions: I&apos;ve been here over 20 times now. Pretty small place. Narrow tables and seats. I don&apos;t come here for the ambience though. 

Service: Straightforward. Nothing special. Pretty fast even when they&apos;re busy which is nice. 

Food: Delicious. Noodles are made in store. Many ramen options. Tastes very close to what I grew up eating in Japan. Spicy broths are killer good. A bit pricey but well worth it in my opinion. Authentic gyoza too which is a rarity outside Japan. 

Miscellaneous: Uneven table legs can be annoying. Hard chairs with no backs can be difficult to sit on for long periods of time. 

Conclusion: I&apos;m a regular here and will continue to frequent Samurai Noodle. Speedy service and consistent execution of tasty ramen is an absolute diamond in the rough in Seattle. Eat here now!","It&apos;s hard for me to not like a ramen spot. Like you really gotta try hard for me not to like your ramen spot. Lol so all of my ramen reviews are always pretty positive 

Anyway we came for some ramen and a quick brew and the cool thing I like about this spot is that we kinda came when they were about to close and we didn&apos;t know and they were hella cool about it (of course we tipped extra good for our ignorance) and to me that&apos;s what makes for the best spots. The ramen will always be cool but the service is a super important determining factor too. 

Anyway I got the norm for ramen picks (check the pic, I also get spicy some times but at new spots it&apos;s easier to add the spicy and impossible to take spicy away). Solid spot, definitely will return but next time I&apos;ll burn a jay before going just like tradition.","Ramen  ?! There are multiple locations nowadays for ramen and everyone of them are different style and taste. This place I have to say its average. It is a popular place for the students to go for lunch, dinner, and etc. Its in the University district. 

They use to have Samurai Noodle around Capital Hill area, but that location was close. After trying out this location for their ramen. It decent, but the service was friendly and fast. One thing could improve their broth is that when they serve the bowl it could be a little more hotter. If its a cold rainy day, I would prefer my broth to be a little hotter then at the temperature which is right at the boarder line of cold. I&apos;m not so sure about the noodle that they have. I think its Egg Noodle. I do know some Ramen places they use fresh noodle unfrozen. This place the noodle taste like its package from some other company. I mean its alright but when you put the ramen in my bowl it should not be in a bundle or stick together. 

I gave this place a 3 stars its because the customer service was good, and it was a good location with full size window open in the summer time. Just the food itself I have to take some stars off the chart. I won&apos;t mind if I have to go back here again. I will just try some other type of noodle to put in the bowl. I usually do Udon noodle instead of egg noodle.","Got recommended it by a friend, which is the only reason I chose to go here among all the choices in on University Way. The storefront didn&apos;t look too welcoming and there weren&apos;t many people on a Sunday evening. 

I had the takoyaki and the garlic shoyu ramen. The takoyaki tasted not bad, but there was only a tiny piece of octopus in each ball. The garlic ramen broth was full of fried and fresh garlic, which I loved. The noodles though tasted a lot like instant noodles. And the piece of pork was dry and flavorless. The soft boiled egg (which was not included in a 12$ bowl) was torn and not very neatly presented. 

The service was super quick though. The price a little high for ramen. There is definitely much better tasting ramen in Seattle. I would have given this 2 stars, but I&apos;m adding one for all the garlic!",Went to this ramen shop with three friends as all of us had cravings for ramen. I ordered the signature ramen but the broth and noodles are not my type as I was expecting the broth to be thicker and richer.,"I was craving Takoyaki one day and this restaurant appears on my yelp recommendation. Located on the ave, Samurai Noodle is one of the few places for ramen before you leave off for other place like capitol hill. 

I have a lot of friends who said this place is meh or not good, but for me it&apos;s fine. I ordered a ramen and shared a Takoyaki with my friend. The Takoyaki is decent. It&apos;s definitely not like one of those that you buy at Takoyaki food truck, but it at least mimics the texture and flavors. My craving was satisfied after eating theirs. 

Their ramen is also not that bad. The soup is definitely less richer than many other places and some people argue it&apos;s too fake to be called ramen. But again I was fine with it. It might be average but it&apos;s not bad at all.  

I also love how they move the doors away when it&apos;s hot outside so that you feel like you&apos;re eating outside. Not a bad place to give a try!","Tried this place due to the good reviews. Ordered a tsukemen (fish broth). Fish broth is very disappointed, as it only had the sour taste but not the thickness. 
Noodles itself wasn&apos;t suitable for dipping as well, as it failed to capture the flavour of the soup, and lacks the springiness.
Ordered a tonkotsu broth to attempt to rescue the meal. Tonkotsu broth was way better than the fish broth hence I placed the remaining noodles inside it.
Chashuu was good. 
The rest of the toppings complimented well, I enjoyed the toppings more than the noodle.
Egg was disappointing as it was hard boiled (They didn&apos;t promise &apos;s a lava egg though, but stating iit as it is commonly found in authentic Ramen shops)

Recommend not to go for their tsukemen. Toppings were great except the egg.
However, it cannot be considered an authentic Japanese ramen shop.","Ryo-san knows noodles like nobody&apos;s business. Samurai Noodle&apos;s delicious ramen sets your soul straight for days. 

Seriously, what other Seattle ramen restaurant even comes close? SLURRRRRRP! So oishii!","I went to this place because I was craving ramen badly! The ramen I had was okay for the price, and the wait time was quick, but I&apos;m very disappointed in the service. 

A young Asian man was my server but had such a bad attitude the whole time and truly looked like he hated being there. He never smiled and didn&apos;t seem helpful what so ever. I left a bad tip, and I hope he reads this.","It&apos;s been at least several years since I was last here, but I was in the area, it was raining, and ramen seemed like the perfect thing.

The food here is solid. I appreciate that it&apos;s not an endless menu, but still manages to have variety. I walked in fully intending on trying the spicy miso ramen. However, my attention was immediately drawn to the seasonal mushroom ramen. I love mushrooms and this ramen boasts 3 different kinds in the shoyu (chicken) broth. I&apos;m so thrilled with my choice. Each kind of mushroom had its own flavor and it creates a symphony in your mouth.  The slice of pork belly melts and the noodles are cooked well. I cautiously added a little bit of Sriracha towards the end. I wanted some spice, but didn&apos;t want to ruin the flavor of the broth.  It worked out just fine.

The four-star rating is the average between food, service, and environment. I&apos;ve definitely had better ramen in my life, but this satisfies that ramen craving sufficiently. The restaurant service leaves much to be desired. Additionally, the way the restaurant is set up, you can see directly into it. It&apos;s a bit of a mess and container lids are not always properly on, and various other small things made me want to ignore the state of the kitchen as much as possible.

But overall it&apos;s a great place to get some yummy ramen in your tummy and I definitely would recommend.","Mixed feelings about this place. The food was really good and the staff were nice and friendly but it took us FOREVER to get our food ordered (we were sitting for at least 20 mins with your menus AFTER I started keeping track). Honestly not the fault of the staff, the management clearly didn&apos;t have enough people scheduled (there was one poor server managing the entire floor!!). It can&apos;t be hard to get staff when you&apos;re located right next to a huge university, can it?!

5 stars for the food and the hardworking server, 2 stars for wait time. I&apos;d average it around 3.5 but gave them the benefit of the doubt.","We stopped by for dinner and didn&apos;t really enjoy our experience. It was a bit pricey for the quality that it was. The ramen was okay, nothing special. They made it so fast which means everything was probably already prepared so it wasn&apos;t as fresh. Their shrimp shumai and tempura didn&apos;t seem fresh either. Seemed like they just heated up frozen food. 

I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be coming back again.",Samurai is hands down the best ramen restaurant in town and it is so underrated for how good their ramen is. All of their soups are so different and so rich in flavor. I normally get the miso soup or the spicy miso. It is the perfect portion size also. Not too much noodles and not too little but I always find myself ordering extra noodles. They also have options for vegans too which is cool. Totally recommend going here for ramen for something different from any other ramen places. I&apos;ve been going here for 4 years and it&apos;s still my favorite ramen restaurant.,"Went there around 1:30 on Tuesday. Not crowded at all and seated right away. Me and my friend order ed Shoyu Ramen and Tonkotsu Ramen with extra bacon and egg topping. As for the broth, I really love the Tonkotsu broth. It&apos;s really rich and not very watery like Shoyu broth. The egg is cooked to perfection as well; not well cooked. The noddle is cooked right. Since I love my ramen a bit spicy, i added the spicy sauce and it was the BOMB! LOVED IT!! The spicy sauce + Tonkotsu broth =","I&apos;ve been to the International District location and have always been a little annoyed by the cramp spacing there. This location, however, is much more spacious and it makes the dining experience much better.

I got the shoyu tonkotsu ramen, which is chicken and pork broth. The broth is really not salty at all, which I really appreciate. The noodles, however, are really nothing special. They don&apos;t really have that good chew and are just unforgettable. The pork slices (I got one extra) were way too dry and tough, and not as tender as I remember them being on my previous visits here. 

Their prices range around $11-$13, which is on par with other ramen places, but I feel like there are other ramen restaurants that are more deserving of charging that price point. I used to love this chain, but I think I might be looking for a new go-to ramen joint.","Visiting from out of town and randomly chose this restaurant. The space is not fancy (a bit worn), but is functional enough. The food was amazing. I had the vegan miso ramen and was pleasantly surprised by the rich white miso broth. 5 stars for that alone. The bowl included roasted boy choi and carrots which added another delicious dimension to this comforting meal. Fresh tofu and corn completed the ingredients. 

My sister had an Autumn mushroom ramen with a meat-based broth and a generous serving of pork. She raved about it.

The servings are large. The only negative (and this is nitpicking) is that the orders were delivered to tables randomly and not together for a single table. I had to wait 5+ minutes for my meal after my sister received her&apos;s. We observed the same pattern with other tables. It was, however, worth the wait.

I do reccomend this restaurant and will return if I ever have the opportunity.","It&apos;s my first time to come here. Ordered Shouyu Tonkotsu ramen. I don&apos;t like the texture of the egg noodle, but the broth is very good. The portion was not big either, because I didn&apos;t feel full at all. What interests me is that they have a Ramen Mt. Fuji, and anyone can finish it will get $3 discount. I don&apos;t know how many people have conquered this ramen mountain, but I might become one of them someday.","This is such a cute place for nice cocktails and conversations. It&apos;s advertised as a speakeasy bar, but very open and spacious and serves food. I came here solely for drinks since after dining at the restaurant across the street.

They have really creative cocktail names and the bartender was very knowledge and friendly in helping us.","I&apos;ll start with the pros, because there are very few.
Pros: The ambience is beautiful! In food; the curried cauliflower and the burrata salad are winners. In drinks I liked the Apres Vous and French Pop. That&apos;s about it. It all goes downhill from here.

Cons:
Incorrect billing. Make sure you check your bill carefully! I have attached a copy of my bill and the menu for reference. You can see that for 2 of the drinks they charged us extra. The 14 year Oban whiskey costs 15$ on the menu &amp; they charged us 18$ for it. Similarly Westland first Pete costs 13$ on the menu and they charged us 15$.

Rude waitress. When we called our waitress to inform her about the error in the bill, she was annoyed and literally rolled her eyes at us.

Service is extremely slow to say the least. It takes a while for them to take your order and even longer to get your order. They charge a 20% tip by default for this horrible service.

The drinks are Bad. We were a group of 8 and nobody enjoyed their drinks. I had one of the seasonal drinks called &quot;Winston&quot; which was way too strong to digest. I also asked for a custom drink with egg white and chocolate which was okay and not worth the 15$ price point. Another friend also ordered a custom drink with egg white and citrus flavors that tasted awful. We also had the Power Lunch which I did not enjoy. 

In food; their Gnocchi was barely digestable. Extremely chewy with very little sauce. 
In the green beans, the best part was the candied bacon. The green beans itself was undercooked.

I would not recommend this place! Seattle has a ton of speakeasys and cocktail bars that are 100 times better.","Overall: Although the food is a bit pricey, The Backdoor is worth a shot if you&apos;re in the mood for a great cocktail.

The good: Great, unique drinks. We both got the Ryan Gosling and were not disappointed. The fries were also a huge hit, I just wish there were more of them with the order. The atmosphere is dive-y yet classy, and was honestly a lot bigger than what I was expecting. We came on an empty night but I could see it being a lot of fun when there&apos;s a crowd.

The not-so-good: The tacos and fries were a bit overpriced. They tasted fine, but they were too expensive for what they were. 

Food/drink: 8/10
Atmosphere: 8/10
Service: 8/10",This is such a cute place gives some serious HP Vibes. The drinks are good. It&apos;s a fun place to sit and chill with friends or solo.,"My gf found this place on a list of bars to visit. It sounded cool so we made a reservation to bring my sister and friend while they were in town. Parking was easy (5.00). We were greeted by a smiling face and a really cool setting. The drinks and food were delicious and everything came pretty quick. The waitress Moved a bit fast but I&apos;m not too bothered by it because they looked short-staffed. The same person that was a host also cleaned tables, and made the drinks at the bar. They didn&apos;t miss a beat ! I would definitely go back again. Very welcoming","I&apos;ve been to Backdoor for their cocktails a few times and I had enjoyed my experience - mainly because of the vibe of the place and the strength of the cocktails. But the last time I went there with a group of friends, I was very disappointed. A few reasons - 
1. The server was incredibly rude, with an abundance of eye-rolling and irritation. I am not sure why someone who has a problem with large groups is in the hospitality business.
2. The cocktails I had were decent, but not mind-blowing. I had the french pop and I liked it. The other drink I had (&quot;surprise me&quot;) didn&apos;t work out too well, even though I had prescribed the liquor, flavor and tonality of the drink I wanted.
3. The drinks and food are not cheap and I&apos;d expect more for the price we paid. In food, we loved the curried cauliflower and burrata. We did not like the green beans - they were undercooked (and contain candied bacon FYI).
(One extra star due to some of the positives, but all in all - a poor experience)","Trying to explore all the cocktail bars, I came to this place from multiple recommendations. Even though its advertised as a speakeasy, it doesn&apos;t really feel that way. The space is quite large, and it has more of a restaurant/bar vibe over a cocktail bar. I&apos;ve visited multiple times without a wait so in that aspect, the large space makes it worth it. The drink menu on the other hand definitely lives up to the description. 

There is quite a comprehensive list of various cocktails for every palate at a reasonable price (~$12-14 each). The service has always been great and the cocktails were crafted to satisfaction. There was live jazz playing on one of the nights I visited too!

Overall, this is a great spot for cocktails and even a date! I&apos;d recommend checking it out, and I&apos;ll be back to try the other selections on the menu!","Great unique drinks! We loved the the ambience and live jazz band. We also loved our bartendress who was kind, knowledgeable and poured some of the best drinks we had our whole trip. Definitely a great pit stop!","Provender: great selection of booze. They have Blanton&apos;s if you like bourbon. Great staff. Shawn, the bartender was very attentive. 

Prices: reasonable for what it is.

Parking: they have a small lot. The bar is at the end of the lot.

People: an eclectic mix. There were older folks early on, and when it started to get dark the hipsters started to emerge.

Perks: I don&apos;t know why they describe this joint as a speakeasy. It was just too bright and there were too many tables, but that&apos;s a good thing o suppose. The decor is all over the place - there are mini statues, painted walls 1920s style, and this weird broken window chandelier thing. Bit it all seems to work.","Hmmm! I&apos;ve heard stories about this place and when I entered the establishment I was blown away! The decor was awesome! Reminded me of a place I use to work at on Broadway(Charlie&apos;s)! But, decors seemed updated! From the chandelier to the nice seats to the semi round bar! The bar has some decor as well. I just like the vibe in the restaurant / bar! The place was 50% capacity but it seemed to be just happening anyway! I guess there was a group of 20 maybe having an office happy hour session! Made the noise level louder than usual. 

Anyway, I ordered a beer, lemon drop and some wings! Now the wings were  awesome! Seriously! I asked the waiter, who by the way was dressed in street clothes like he was a customer! No uniform what so ever! Right, the wings! Smoked then flashed fried and sauces on the side! I mean dang!! I asked the waiter to give the kitchen my compliments because it&apos;s really hard to find wings that taste good in Seattle! 

I would definitely come back and try a different item on the menu! I&apos;ll also come back for Happy Hour! As I read their HH menu and drink specials I was intrigued! I always want try a good to great HH!!! I&apos;ll be back!","A nice spot for casual dinner and drinks.

Service - 3/5
A little on the slow side but I guess they still get the job. We came on a Thursday evening for happy hour and it seemed like they were a little short staff. The bartender seated us then the waitress greeted us. The waitress that we had was actually very nice and sweet. It was slow because it was mainly her taking care of most of the customers there.

Food - 4/5
Great happy hour and dinner menu. We ordered a bunch of food but my favorite items were hush puppies, fish tacos, and crab cakes! Can&apos;t get enough of those.

Highly recommended!","This place has a cool vibe and a great menu.  The staff was friendly and the pricing was fair. 

Recommended!","Loved this speakeasy-style lounge in Fremont! Unique and cozy decor, attentive and friendly bartender. Ordered a couple drinks and the tacos - all yum! Definitely check this vibey place out if you&apos;re in the area!","What a fun spot in Fremont! We were an party of four and ordered just about everything on the Happy Hour menu...oyster shooters, nachos, chicken wings, hummus, grilled cheese with fig jam, fried pickles.  Everything was tasty! It was a little bit cold by the time we got our food, but it was pretty busy and they didn&apos;t seem to have an abundance of servers.  There is an extensive cocktail list (we had French Drop, margaritas, prosecco). 
We loved the coziness and ambiance of this place, so we will be back.","Great place to hang out if I don&apos;t want to run into anybody that I know. Nice change of pace and environment than what I&apos;m used to. Nice variety of food on menu too although it&apos;s basically bar food. My friend loves how affordable the fine whiskys are here. I don&apos;t drink whisky so I wouldn&apos;t know, but I do eat food and the food are pretty darn edible here. I love how there&apos;s a parking lot right in front although you have to pay. 

Tell me about your experience if you&apos;ve been here or is going to after reading this review:)","Really really disappointed 
My boyfriend and I were trying to find a cute place for a last minute date night and saw this place and were so excited! 
I so wish we would have gone somewhere els. The bartender working was rude from the very beginning. Not walking us to our table, telling us to grab our own menus, rude, gruff and really impersonal. We asked for a booth and he said no. Just plain no. We asked if we could have one once one was clean and he said yes. A table opened up and it looked clean, so  we tried to move their and he shouted at us in front of the other 4 tables that were eating as well. 
As a server myself I&apos;m really offended. Just because it is a weeknight doesn&apos;t mean people are less special or deserve to be shouted at.  
I left the place in tears.",Came here for a coworkers going away happy hour and I was really impressed. The happy hour menu is awesome (though I only had food so can&apos;t really speak to the drinks). The ocean shrimp tacos were so good and the aioli that the mug of fries came with was literally the best I&apos;ve ever had. I would definitely come here again.,"Get the mug of fries. It has a coating like a curly fry but it&apos;s so much better.
Good drinks too, but the fries are what stuck with me more, lol","Good God, their fried pickles are on point!! 

I had such a good time here, the food was delicious and fried to perfection, portions were modest but shareable, and the drinks were strong!  I highly recommend going for happy hour, bringing a bunch of friends and ordering everything. So. Freaking. Tasty.","I wouldn&apos;t really call it a speakeasy but it&apos;s a fun bar. I enjoyed a few of the cocktails. I think the bartenders are good at making drinks but don&apos;t trust staff recommendations. 

The menu is long which can make it hard to find anything you actually want to order. 

The decor is interesting the first time you visit but the more you come the less you will think that.

Staff are great people.","I ordered takeout during COVID-19. I got the hummus with pita ($7) and Sinbad&apos;s Gyro Sandwich ($9). The hummus was very tasty, but a little bit on the salty side. It was definitely different than plain old hummus from some other places so I would recommend it. The Gyro Sandwich was amazing and packed with meat. The meat was juicy and flavorful while the veggies helped balance out the heavy meat. They also add a nice white sauce that is creamy and adds a nice boost to the flavor of the sandwich. The price was good for the portion sizes and the gyro sandwich was amazing. Great place to get a gyro sandwich! Highly recommend!","I&apos;m a fan of the great flavors, generous portions, and dedicated folks who run this place. The food is so delicious and consistent. I think of the chicken shawarma as a pick-me-up meal for when I&apos;m glum, and I was so happy when I found out they were open for ordering in advance for takeout. I used to go regularly and eat in, and the quality remains the same for takeout. The guys who run this place really clearly put their heart into it and I&apos;m glad to keep being a patron.",Ahmad is awesome! Super friendly and helpful! The food is amazing! Highly suggest coming! They are open during COVID with seating outside(social distancing is required). Great place to be on a nice day!,"Sinbad has been a regular lunch spot of mine for years now.  It checks all the major boxes for me, which are: quick, tasty, and inexpensive.

I almost always get the falafel pita.  I&apos;ve always found the flatbread to be soft, warm and fresh, and they stuff a pretty substantial amount of food into them.  The falafels are great, nice and crispy on the outside and well-spiced.  The veggies are generally fresh and crisp too...but if I had to nitpick, once in a while I do get a couple pieces of lettuce that are just starting to go brown.  Make sure you ask for hot sauce on the side - this is critical.

If you&apos;re in more of a carnivorous mood, their gyros are also pretty dang tasty.  The fries are pretty generic but still hit the spot when I want something fried. Their dolmas are also on my go-to list, although they&apos;re a bit on the pricey side. 

In short, if you&apos;re looking for a quick, tasty bite in Fremont that won&apos;t break the bank - Sinbad is an excellent option!  It&apos;s a tough time for restaurants right now, so let&apos;s all do what we can to keep it local :)","After a run, I needed some fuel and this place was close by and it was open. 
We decided to get the super plate with cauliflower and eggplants. It came with hummus, pita, salad, rice and a soft drink. We also got the Sinbad fries which seems to be popular here. I also got a free drink for a yelp check in :)

The gyro fries was pretty good. It was cooked to order so the fries was still crispy and I like that they didn&apos;t over sauce the dish. But they definitely did not go easy on the meat, there was a lot! 
The super plate was good too. Especially the cauliflower, that was so flavorful and I like the subtle crisp to it. The rice was on the bland side but everything else was pretty good 

They didn&apos;t skimp on portion either as we couldn&apos;t finish our food and had leftover. The only thing right now is that the workers didn&apos;t wear masks or anything so it can cause concern to many people.","I ordered a chicken gyro plate to go. It was $18. The rice was not dry enough. The chicken was dry and bland. The meat didnt have enough marinate. The salad dressing was salty. The pita bread was dry. The hummus was not creamy and rich. 
The service was slow.

My favorite mediterranean restaurant is in Uw Area.","The gyros are good here!  I visited Sinbad Express for a quick lunch in Fremont.  It had a been a long time since I had a good gyro, and Sinbad Express definitely hit the spot. 

On a weekday for a late lunch, close to 2PM, the place was quiet, with only two patrons dining in.  There were a few people getting takeout.  But I was easily able to find a seat by the window.  The space is located in a small business complex, right behind the Lenin statue.  You can&apos;t miss it.  

I ordered the Sinbad gyro, and to my understanding from the employee, it differs from the standard gyro because of the garlic sauce and feta addition.  The standard gyro has tzatziki sauce instead of the garlic sauce.  I would recommend upgrading to the Sinbad gyro for a dollar more because the garlic sauce was very good!  I also ordered a small fries to go with, and if you check-in on Yelp, you get a free drink. 

For dining in, they bring your meal to you.  It didn&apos;t take long for me to get my lunch and everything was made once ordered.  The Sinbad gyro was packed with beef and lamb gyro meat, and it had a really nice sauce from the cook of the meat.  Yum!  The garlic sauce was also good, with the feta.  It also came with lettuce, tomato and caramelized onions, all rolled into a soft pita bread.  The fries were perfectly crispy, with some seasoning on them for that extra flavor.  

I&apos;m glad to have found Sinbad Express for a casual, quick lunch in the center of the universe.  Food doesn&apos;t take long to prepare, portions were filling, and you can&apos;t beat that garlic sauce!","Seriously, no other gyro spot can compare. The people working are also always really nice and speedy with making the orders.","I make about 13.5/hour + tips. I do my best to be compassionate during these hard times. 3 months ago I tipped a guy working here $20 for an order of $10.
11 days ago , I had a similar order and the same guy threw the change in from my $20 bill into his tip jar after I had already tipped $3. Because of this, I will avoid coming here for at least 6 months and will refuse to enter if this same man is working. Had he not been rude he probably would make more tips over time. Well, that&apos;s life. Sploosh sploosh.",Had the lamb/beef Sinbad Gyro as recommended and it did not disappoint. Every bite was full of flavor and the bread was pillowy and warm. Great value!,"This place is located near The troll landmark so it&apos;s great to stop by after visiting. 

The menu was typical of a Greek spot with good combo options and great for dairy free eaters. I ordered the Greek fries which looked exactly like a previous yelpers photos. It was like the gyro pita but laid on top of fries. There was plenty of sauce, cheese and meat on top of the large bed of fries. 

The restaurant itself was somewhat warm but they did have outdoor seating as well. 

Overall a great place to stop in and get some Greek food real quick while in the area. All the restaurants in the area were higher priced because of the location but $10 for this was not a bad deal.","Been to the place twice. Both times the food has been excellent and the employees are incredibly friendly. We&apos;ve tried the chicken gyros, the lamb gyros, Shawarma sandwiches, and French fries. I&apos;d recommend getting the fries with any sandwich because they&apos;re fantastic. 

Definitely recommend!",Excellent food and always friendly serving in the heart of Fremont for many years. Kitchen is open late so walk up or order ahead for quick tasty food anytime.,"I was at Fremont troll with my husband and wanted to grab a quick bite. We went to this place to get a veggie gyro. The service was quick and the gyro was good.
The location is quite convenient and they also have outdoor seating area which is a bonus in Seattle summer.
We also found the prices reasonable.",Great spot for delicious Mediterranean food. Sinbad fries are the hit! So good id kick your mother down a flight of stairs for just the opportunity to smell a spoonful. I&apos;ll be back and watch your mom.,"4.5 stars

This is a great place for your late night cravings after a night out in Fremont because they close at 3am on Friday and Saturday nights. We came here after some arcade fun at Add-a-Ball which was close by.

I ordered the Sinbad&apos;s gyro with lamb ($8.65) which was really good. The lamb was soft and everything just tasted so good together. The meat, the sauce, the cheese: everything was on point. My drunchies intensified my taste buds and the gyro really satisfied them.

I tried some of my friends&apos; orders like the Greek fries and the Sinbad fries and they were both really good as well. I enjoy meat so I preferred the Sinbad fries. They gave pretty big portions so it might also be a good idea to split it with someone. Late night drunchies and loaded fries will always have a special place in my heart and I can store a place for these fries as well.

I&apos;d definitely recommend the lamb on anything where you can pick your meat.","Our favorite Gyro spot! The sinbad fries are always amazing, the gyro salad is a staple, and nothing like a big lamb/beef gyro here with fries! It&apos;s always tasty, service is friendly, and it&apos;s consistent!! Love this place. We haven&apos;t found a place that compares in north seattle!","Stopped by here and ate in the outdoor patio/seating area. The food was fantastic. We ordered the falafel, pita, hummus, baba ganoush, Greek salad, gyro plate. Everything was great. I&apos;d come back.","I got the Sinbad fries (half lamb/beef and half chicken). I gotta say, personally I think Sinbad makes one of the best gyro Greek fries. The portions are big and they don&apos;t hold back on the meat. The way they season the meat is 10/10. Their gyro sandwiches are also amazing. Their prices are just a little more than the average gyro shop but I think it&apos;s still worth it any day.",Love this place! It&apos;s become a weekly staple for me. The food is consistently great. I usually get the sinbad gyro and the gyro chicken dinner plate. I love the salad and the fresh hummus and pita. It&apos;s the whole package. The chef is friendly and remembers my usual by now. It&apos;s very nice.,Always great quality and does not deter even during Covid times... keep doing what your doing there.,"Went here last week for my first night and had an amazing experience! The interior decor is awesome when you first walk in, and the staff was very nice and accommodating right off the bat. I had the Myconos salad and hummus with pita break and it was all delicious at a fair price! Would definitely recommend to those who haven&apos;t been.","I had been wanting to try out Costa&apos;s for some time and finally did this week. In the future I probably wouldn&apos;t order eggs again from this restaurant via Uber Eats because when they arrived they were not even lukewarm. And the order was up way ahead of schedule with 7 minutes from pickup to delivery. There&apos;s nothing exciting about cold eggs no matter how good they may have started out. The fruit was fresh and a good helping but it was weird to have fruit on aluminum foil. The metal imparts a metallic flavor that I don&apos;t particularly enjoy. I would recommend they use a non metallic container in the future for the fruit. My husband ordered a sandwich from the lunch menu and said it was very good - I only sampled the fries, which were indeed very tasty! The fries were warm upon arrival so maybe the chef needs to prep the eggs last in a to-go order in the future.","I rarely give one star ratings but I had a bad experience with this restaurant because they overcharged our bill. First of all, why do they do manual calculations instead of doing it electronically? If my friends and I weren&apos;t poor college students, we wouldn&apos;t have double checked the calculation to find that they charged us $4 for a single egg instead of $2 (which was expensive in the first place for the quality anyway). And this isn&apos;t a singular occurrence based on other reviews, and we&apos;re the ones who have caught it. 

I actually liked the overall calm ambiance created by the greenery. But my friends and I all found there to be a strange &quot;old people&quot; smell when we walked in. The wait was long and they only had two people working. I didn&apos;t know the blueberries would be inside the pancakes (my mistake though) so I didn&apos;t enjoy the taste of warm blueberry in the pancakes.",Costa&apos;s is my favorite sit-down restaurant on University Ave! They have such a wide range of items on their menu. Their bottomless mimosas are truly bottomless. Great food and great atmosphere!,"I&apos;ve been a long time customer here and was scrolling from Uber eats and came across here. I trusted this place, the food is always yummy. It was a good choice.

Tell me why I spent $40 for gnocchi and tatziki/pita and I get a quarter of a pita bread and 3 forks of gnocchi? Their other food is great (spanikopita/mousaka/etc)  but I&apos;m so frustrated. Was hungry and now I&apos;m just hangry. :(",Great little local eatery! It&apos;s particularly great for a classic breakfast or brunch. We had the chance to stop in for lunch recently and had their Bacon Cheddar Burger w/fries. And (not pictured) the Club. Both were great and satisfying! Love the crispy fries too!,"I just over paid for a very small breakfast. Hash browns, one egg of scrambled eggs, and one slice of toast. I made two orders of this and it cost over $20 and I picked this order up so it wasn&apos;t as though I was paying a delivery fee.
The portions were small and the food mediocre",The pricing is great!!! Definitely order the mimosas! The menu has a variety of things that can make everyone happy!,"their bottomless mimosas on sundays are the best! Kamryn is an amazing server, you must go.","Sometimes you&apos;re in the mood for a diner breakfast. You don&apos;t want a list of ingredients hand-picked in the forest, you want butter, flavor and carbs. I was in such a mood when I stopped here for brunch on a Sunday.

I was greeted pretty quickly and shown to a sunny table. (A treat in Seattle in October.) I liked the warm decor of the restaurant. 

They didn&apos;t have many options for brunch drinks, only mimosas if I recall. The mimosa was tasty. It&apos;s hard to go wrong with them but plenty a restaurant has, so credit where it&apos;s due. 

I ordered a special, the bread pudding french toast. It came in two large slices drizzled in berry compote and served with whipped cream and ice cream. I understand the urge to serve bread pudding with ice cream if it&apos;s a dessert, but it was unnecessary with breakfast. The whipped cream did the trick just fine. The texture was dense and it was a plentiful meal, but I was disappointed in the execution. If you&apos;re combining the heavenly blessings of bread pudding and french toast, the result shouldn&apos;t be inferior to both. 

It did the trick in terms of filling me up for a Sunday nap. If I returned I&apos;d try the standard fare - not all specials work out as planned.","I ordered the bob for brunch which is not bad honestly, HOWEVER, I asked for a side of fruits, after I saw it, I got so disappointed because their fruits for the side order is almost 6 dollars. I WOULD NOT pay for one banana, strawberry, couple grapes and soft melon for that kind of price.",This place is so good! I love coming here Saturday mornings and getting breakfast . The breakfast burrito is by far my favorite but there are so many great options. The service is great as well.,"Costa&apos;s is one of the only full service, sit down restaurants on the Ave, which is a nice change of pace from the typical order-at-the-counter, seat-yourself style places on the Ave. I&apos;ve been here twice and have had a decent experience both times. The waiter service was average, nothing great or bad. I ordered the California burrito both times by coincidence and enjoyed them both: extremely flavorful with the right ratio between meat and veggies. I was also surprised by the generous amount of avocado in the burrito, since typically restaurants put a tiny piece of avocado in a dish and call it &quot;California.&quot;

The value isn&apos;t amazing by any means, and I wouldn&apos;t call it a &quot;steal&quot; of the Ave, being around $15 with tax and tip for a generous, but not gigantic portion. I usually prefer to pay less than $10 for a meal at a restaurant, but I guess that&apos;s the small extra price to pay for sit-down service. I&apos;ll be back, but it won&apos;t become a regular go-to.",5 stars for bottomless mimosas but we also got the sunrise scramble which had hard inedible artichokes :c 10/10 for mimosas though. Also we get seated near a window for better ventilation,I love their salmon omelette! Great service and food. Love coming here for breakfast.,What a great spot! Really nice group working there. I&apos;m always greeted with kind servers and fabulous food. Very deserving of a five star review.,"The bottomless mimosas hit the spot on the weekends! Kami was super nice, best server i&apos;ve ever had at costas.","MANAGEMENT - YOU ARE UNDERSTAFFED, HIRE MORE SERVERS

Came in during primetime on Sunday for breakfast. 2 servers for the entire place. Server only came by once to take our order and a second time to drop off the food. No coffee refills because server never came around. We were done for at least 15 minutes before we could apprehend the server and ask for the check. I dont blame the servers at all because they&apos;re constantly busy.

Food was pretty good, got the Florentine Benedict. Overall was good except for one weirdly cold spot in my Benedict, maybe spinach wasn&apos;t heated up properly.","I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. Breakfast is served all day. The host provided me with excellent timing. I am very impressed. I would attach a photo of the food, but I ate as soon as I got it. I will attach a photo off my second cup of coffee.","Called the other day for a takeout order. ETA was 15-20 minutes. It was ready when I got there.

Ordered a ruben on a gluten free bun with fries. It was amazing! Delicious flavor, cheesy, sweet onions, and a yummy sauce. The corned beef had a good flavor to it. 

The only thing I&apos;m sad about is not finding this place sooner! I&apos;ll be back.",So so good. Got the special. On a non-COVID Friday night i imagine parking would be extremely difficult as it is right on Westlake. Fast and very friendly service.,They have a great outdoor patio set-up and even provided hot water bottles to everyone! Yummy food and great beers on tap!,"If I could give you more stars I would. Thank you for your excellent service, and attention to detail. We had 2 groups seated separately. We came from our first soccer game of the season, and you even hooked us up with an ice pack. g ood beer and tasty cocktails!  All the food was amazing, sorry we didn&apos;t take pictures. The Lisa&apos;s Hot Mess was the winner!!! Peanut butter on a burger!!! YES, YES, YES!!!  The eggs Benedict were perfectly poached and inhaled by a teenage boy. And the custom ordered bunless  burger was B-E-A-UTIFUL!!!","A group of 6 friends and I came to Otter Bar and Burger after Saturday morning kayaking around Lake Union. We were so hungry and in the mood for a juicy burger and fries. We came around 12:30pm and there were only a few people in the restaurant and one server. The menu is filled with beach shack vibes serving all different types of burgers, sandwiches and even fish tacos! Service was very slow. It took a while to get our orders in and for the food to come out. We also had to walk up the cashier to pay. Because there was only one server for the whole restaurant, paying took a while as well.

Monterey Chicken Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries: I was a little disappointed with the chicken sandwich. For $13, the sandwich looked like something I could have made at home and didn&apos;t have much flavor to it. I love avocados on sandwiches, but I thought this one didn&apos;t make a difference. On the upside, the chicken was very juicy and cooked well. The sweet potato fries were not that crispy but had a strong sweet potato flavor. Sweet potato fries were also an extra $1.50 but compared to the regular fries, it was worth it. The regular fries were too plain and salty for my liking. I finished my meal still feeling a little hungry.

Overall, lunch was alright at the Otter Bar and Burger. I would be interested to try some of their specials ($10 burger, fries and tall boys on Mondays) other time, but won&apos;t be back for a regular meal.",The service was amazing! Vanessa was our waitress and made sure we had enough food and drinks. Vanessa was also super friendly and so fun to talk to! Thank you Vanessa!! You made our day!,"I was seated outside on their Patio, which was super nice. Additionally, the live music was awesome.

The food was solid, although nothing to write home about. It was a standard burger, which, in my opinion, didn&apos;t merit the price tag.

Finally, the wait staff was attentive, but they weren&apos;t overly nice, I figure this can be chalked up to Covid stresses however.","I really want to like Otter- it&apos;s just down the street, has trivia and other events, and has milkshakes on the menu. I went around a year ago, and then again recently for brunch to see if the new owners had made a difference. 

The food is okay, but not great. This would be fine, but the prices are higher than other places nearby that are actually really good. Even the milkshakes are just okay, at a price point where one would expect something excellent. Even Red Robin does them better!

There are a few vegetarian options, but not many, and they don&apos;t seem particularly accommodating. I asked for to sub an egg for the bacon on my brunch item (almost all the brunch items came with meat), and was charged extra for it. 

I really hope that Otter gets better- at the very least, I&apos;d love to get a good milkshake in the neighborhood- but as it stands, don&apos;t bother. You can get better food and atmosphere close by for cheaper.","I gave this place another try, wondering if it had gotten better over time and because we weren&apos;t in the mood to drive all the way to Fremont to get Uneeda Burger. The buns they use are still the flimsiest things -- mine fell apart before my second bite. Why? Because the usual buffer between the bun and sauce/condiment that a nice piece of lettuce usually provides to avoid bun sogginess doesn&apos;t exist here. Instead, they inexplicably use shredded lettuce and put in on the bottom of the burger. Request for medium well got us both very well done burgers. Fries were unremarkable. The staff are lovely here, but the food just doesn&apos;t measure up, unfortunately.","My husband and I had brunch here and absolutely loved it!  Customer service, food and coffee were great!!!!","First time to Otter Bar &amp; Burger and the burger was perfect. Hit the spot. Will be back for it. I got the side of onion rings. The rings were cooked perfectly, but I wish they came with some sort of a dipping sauce. Pork Chile Verde Stew is delicious. Staff and owner were friendly and they had hand sanitizer and cleaned pens. Stop by!","Otter Bar and Burger is a great experience.   Friendly owners and some amazing food.   The salmon burger is one of my favorites.   With all that&apos;s going on right now I&apos;m the world, these folks are working their butts off and it shows!    Will be back for sure!","This review is based on only a couple of things as I&apos;ve never tried their actual food, but have had their milkshakes several times. I have spent quite some time gathering my opinion on Otter before I posted here as to do it the justice I think it deserves, but some things need seriously worked on.

We have called ahead many times to be told their ice cream machine was down, only to find out actually they stop making shakes 30 min to an hour before closing. Which would typically be fine if it were at all advertised that way but it&apos;s not, and the shutdown time has always varied when we would inquire. The few times we have been able to successfully get the milkshakes they have tasted really really good, but the service is some of the slowest I&apos;ve ever experienced and the people are only nice maybe half the time. Otherwise they are pretty rude or clearly painfully annoyed. The reason we have never stayed for the food has almost all to do with how bad the service is here. 

What really sealed the deal on leaving my review now was our most recent visit. We showed up around 8:15pm and there were only 2 tables sat and about 4 people at the bar. We walked up to the counter and stood there waiting for a whopping 12 minutes before I finally saw a cook come from the back and was able to ask him where a server was. He looked around, and in the most careless tone said, &quot;I don&apos;t know. They must not be around right now.&quot; What?? I tried to get the bartenders attention but every time she looked our way she saw we were waiting and turned around immediately. We left pretty upset with no intention of coming back. 

What establishment expects to succeed in Eastlake if this is the kind of service they have and continue to not improve? It&apos;s honestly a real shame this place hasn&apos;t gotten any better. I&apos;ve tried and tried to see the good in Otter but after that last experience I give up.","Detoured off of I-5 again once it was a full stop by the U District. Meandered down towards University Bridge towards Eastlake to checkout Otter Bar and Burger. 

One can see the old bones of the former  Louisa&apos;s Bakery and Cafe, but clearly the space had been enlarged and reconfigured to its current state. And it&apos;s not named for cute sea mammals, but for a type of seaplane.

Place your order at the counter, pay, and then one is given a place holder - Queen of Clubs in our case. Seat yourself wherever. It started to fill up to take advantage of their Happy Hour (HH) menu items. They also have a pretty extensive menu and full bar.

Person 1 had a HH Tieton Apricot cider ($6), house salad ($5.50), a HH Eastlake slider ($3), and a HH Carolina slider ($3).

Person 2 had a 16 oz Salted Caramel milkshake ($5.25), HH Garlic Parm fries ($6), and HH hot wings ($6).

Me (aka hangry, sleepy hag) I stupidly ordered inappropriate food with a 12 oz HH Ghiradelli Chocolate milkshake ($4), another HH Garlic Parm fries ($6), and a pair of Eastlake sliders ($6). 

Despite the HH prices for most of the items, with tax/tip it was still a little over $67. Decent service. Left full, but not overly satisfied in comparison to leaving L&apos;il Woody&apos;s or Five Guys.",This is my new favorite burger place in Seattle!  They have a blue cheese patty and it is delicious!  You HAVE to get it with the bacon jam!  The staff  here is absolutely WONDERFUL.  They make you feel so welcome and the drinks are great!  Make this your next burger stop in town for sure!,"I had been meaning to try this place despite hearing bad reviews from friends, but I was not pleasantly surprised. Service was slow despite the place being basically empty (6 total people in the place, including 2 employees), menus were dirty (like, noticeably dirty - gross), and the food was very subpar - not good enough to outweigh the otherwise slow and lazy environment. My food was alright at best; the burger was more on par with something from a food truck. My friend was completely unsatisfied with their meal, and wasn&apos;t asked how our meal was going until they were asked if they needed a box. Like I said, wanted to like this place, but I was let down.


But, A+ fries.","Almost wrote a really bad review, but I deleted. 

I&apos;ll keep it simple. Don&apos;t come here for the burgers, and please Otter Bar, remove it from your title. 

The service, beer and atmosphere are great. But the burger was honestly one of the worst I&apos;ve ever had. I thought I had finished it, and then looked down to see that 60% of the bun and toppings were left. The patty may have been smaller than a dicks burger. Actually.

It&apos;s a bar. Not a restaurant.","I was a little disappointed with the burger here. The patty itself didn&apos;t really have any flavor. The bun wasn&apos;t anything special, and it got soggy. It tasted okay once I added all the condiments to it, though, and I liked that they had pickled red onions. The fries were about average.

The restaurant itself was a cool place to visit, though, and the bartender was super friendly.","Decided to try this place after craving burgers all day and wanting to try a new restaurant. Ordered a burger and chicken wrap for pick up - both on lettuce and without any bun/wrap. Sides were a house salad and sweet potato fries.

I ordered the burger medium but it came almost steamed. Same consistency throughout with a ground beef texture. There was also a small hair which is so gross but it wasn&apos;t deep in the food or anything so we just took it off and tried to ignore since we didn&apos;t have much other food at home lol. The deconstructed chicken wrap was a bit bland.

House salad was nothing special just some greens, tomato, cucumber, and carrots. Sweet potato were really good and crispy!

Would not order food again but might come back for a drink around Eastlake!","The ambience is relaxed, the service certainly isn&apos;t zippy but it wasn&apos;t horrendously slow when I went around 1pm, the staff are amiable, and the menu is fairly diverse.

As an Eastlake resident I desperately want to like otter bar and grill, but their non-burger options are for me intolerable.

I can&apos;t speak to the burgers, but the fried and grilled chicken sandwiches and the ahi burger I had were decent at best, and consistently left me feeling unwell. Which was doubly frustrating because it looks great.

I don&apos;t know why, The proportions meat and bread heavy, maybe the oil the chicken was fried in was old, maybe the mayo was a bit off, or the bread was stale. No one thing was a dealbreaker but overall everything felt less than adequate.","Uneeda try this place if you haven&apos;t yet! 

Great food, great value, great staff. This has been a go-to for takeout for me and my boyfriend throughout Covid. Order online and pick up in the outdoor area, it all feels very safe and Covid friendly. 

I will say - some things are definitely better than others and how you order will determine your experience. 

Best burgers: 
Lamb burger - really juicy and delicious 
Veggie burger - one of the best veggie burgers I&apos;ve had 
Salmon burger - more like a grilled pizza of salmon than a minced burger, but delicious! (I think they only have it sometimes)
Chipotle chicken sandwich - very tasty!

Not their best:
Bison burger - I would give this a just ok
Turkey burger - I would skip this one 

Sides:
I love the fried cheese curds, boyfriend thinks they are just okay. 
The sweet potato fries are better than the regular fries (I rarely think that is true). 
Onion rings are delish! (And heavy. But they&apos;re onion rings after all). 

The sauces are also all great - try them all! 

If you love it, great! If you tried it and didn&apos;t like, I would go back and try again with something different!!!","We went to this location for lunch and it was packed. That is always a good sign during the week they have amazing burgers everything is fresh everything is delicious. 

My son is a very picky eater and we were able to find a burger that she would enjoy it&apos;s basically just a plain burger but still have flavor and let me tell you each and every patty is so flavorful and so fresh. We all had different I menu items but we all had the same agreement, that our meals were amazing. they offer different flavors of fries as well as plenty of self-serve fountain drinks and ice teas.

The location is perfect and you can get to it from anywhere in the surrounding Seattle area we will definitely be back it&apos;s one of her favorite burger spots when you wanna really really good burger and not your usual takeout or fast food delivery burgers which you cannot compare to this place go check it out.","I was on yelp and realized I never reviewed this place which SHOCKED ME because this is HANDS down my new favorite burger spot!!!!

During this crazy time, you order through their website and pick up at a walk up window. Parking is rough on some days but THANKFULLY there&apos;s a parking lot behind them so if you already ordered just stop there while you pick up your food.

I&apos;ve tried the crimini mushroom burger, the bbq smash burger and the classic cheeseburger.
The mushroom is by far my FAV but the bbq smash burger doesn&apos;t fall too far behind. SO MUCH FLAVOR, so juicy... omgahhhh.

The classic burger is ehhhh. Felt like didn&apos;t give me that extra umph I look for in a burger.
I can&apos;t wait to keep trying different burgers.

Oh and most importantly they have a ton of sauces that you&apos;ll have access to viewing the list when you order on their website. 
Garlic truffle, chipotle mayo, siracha mayo.... oh my god so much delicious flavor! 
TRY THIS PLACE!!!!","Having passed by this place too many times, we finally stopped in for a quick afternoon weekday bite! It was raining pretty hard when we came, so there was hardly anybody waiting for orders. Since this was our first time, we took a few minutes to look at the menu. Ordinarily, we would have ordered online but this was an impromptu visit so no time for that! ;)

We went with the Big Bison burger ($15) and a side of onion rings ($4) to share. After 10 minutes, our order was ready and we could hardly wait to try it out! Food held up well on the ride home, and the flavor of the burger was delicious. Each bite is a party in your mouth - with the red onion jam and house sauce bringing it all together. The addition of the bacon elevated the texture and flavor of the burger and it wasn&apos;t overwhelming to the flavor of the bison meat. The Beecher&apos;s cheddar cheese was perfectly melted and gave a smoky punch. We were delighted to see the burger had a brioche bun, and it was nicely toasted and buttered...mmmmmm.

Onion rings were fried excellently and the batter was just the right sweetness and thickness to balance the onion itself. It&apos;s a tough thing to master so I would highly recommend ordering these. One order includes 5 big onion rings, so a good amount for sharing.

My only quibble with this place is that even though we enjoyed our burger, the price was just a tad steep for the size. It is definitely a gourmet burger and the quality is 100% there, but it&apos;s close to a $5 difference to the other burgers. Nonetheless, it&apos;s still a great spot and we will be back to try the others.

COVID-19 protocols are followed closely, and you pick up your orders through the garage area up the ramp. Wait times are between 10-15 minutes and service is friendly and quick. Next time I&apos;ll be ordering online!","Ever since switching over to being a vegetarian, I&apos;ve been trying to find a great veggie burger. And let me tell you, Uneeda&apos;s homemade veggie burger checks every box on the checklist. I don&apos;t even think about the meat burgers let alone other burger joints because their veggie burger is just that good.

What do I normally get? The veggie burger with avocado and a friend egg. Cheese curds and a shake. If you don&apos;t top your meal off with a shake, you are truly missing out on the whole experience. 

Everything about Uneeda is perfection. We&apos;re so sad to have only found out about it after being in Seattle for a little over 3 years now. But whenever I do crave a burger, you can bet that I&apos;m eating at Uneedas.","Absolutely delicious burger. Expertly crafted, perfectly balanced. I got the normal burger +cheese, bacon and crispy onion. Would get again.","Covid take out disclosure. I got the lamb burger with beef patty substitute (you can do that with any of their burgers). My wife got the mushroom burger - she shared a bite with me and I didn&apos;t want to give it back! The mushroom burger was delicious. My burger was average; nothing to write home about. Sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty as well. Would order from here again, but probably get the mushroom burger for myself!","COVID-19 Update as of 5/4/2020: Uneeda Burger is doing online order, which is easy to navigate. Access through their website. They have a pick-up window set up.

Great staff. Amazingly tasty burgers and fresh-cut fries. It&apos;ll satisfy your quarantine cravings. Go support them!","*COVID-19 Takeout Review*

Tl;dr: Oh MY god, DELICIOUS mushroom truffle burger and some of the best sweet potato fries I&apos;ve ever had. SO, SO good. Good milkshake, too!

I was thinking with the pandemic and everything happening, and decided that now or never was the time to eat a burger. 

Per my brother&apos;s recommendation, I walked in to Uneeda Burger and placed an order. I waited around 10 -15  minutes for my extra indulgent order-- Mushroom burger, sweet potato fries, and a half blackberry half chocolate shake -- for a total of about $26. 

Unwrapping my burger at home, I was immediately hit by the aroma of beef and truffle... exactly what you want when you order a burger. The mushroom burger tasted just as meaty as it smelled and the truffle flavor was incredible. This thing&apos;s an umami BOMB! The only slight critique is that my burger was cooked medium-well whereas I typically prefer medium-rare burgers, instead. But to be honest, I didn&apos;t really care when I was eating this burger.

Wow! Huge portion of sweet potato fries. They have a great crunchy coating and come with a side of yogurt dipping sauce. The sauce was kind of meh (tasted like plain yogurt to me) so I opted for ketchup instead. Try as I might, I couldn&apos;t finish the entire bag of sweet potato fries so I saved them in the fridge for the next day. To my great surprise, they were just as crisp as they were the other night... sorcery!

To finish my pandemic stress meal off, I got a half blackberry, half chocolate shake-- tastes like a chocolate-covered blackberry! I was so pleased by the perfect thickness of this shake. It was thick but not too thick that I couldn&apos;t sip it through my straw. 

$26 for a single person&apos;s burger meal might seem like a lot, but with the portion sizes of everything (but especially the fries and shake) and their respective quality, I ultimately think the price is fair.

I&apos;m still thinking about that mushroom burger... might need another one again, soon!","Being my first time, I looked past the variety of more gourmet burger options and opted for the basic.  I think the whole burger could have been pretty good, but it was just okay due to the excessive oddly bitter aioli/sauce concoction. The beef burger itself wasnt bad, but it didnt nearly hit my omg tastebud either. 

The first 2 onion rings gave bliss, in a greasy state-fair sort of way, then I wondered why they couldn&apos;t master them to hold less grease. I ate the 3rd guiltily, and forsook the remainder, because I don&apos;t think eating tablespoons of fat in one meal is ever a good decision.

I&apos;m a just-water purist with meals, and will take a drink as a separate  experience, but when my water tasted and smelled of chlorine bleach, I returned to the register for 2 sodas seeing they offered unique ones such as prickly pear and ginger beer from the tap.  With the 2 new &quot;glasses&quot; (plastic tumblers) recieved I learned that they too smelled of chlorine.  Apparently bathing them in chlorine in between customers is what they do here, with a good hot rinse being low on the list. While I appreciate the effort in killing pathogens, nothing you eat from should smell of chlorine....maybe it&apos;s the plastic tumblers needing to be replaced with actual glass glasses.

I will return, with my own bottled water, and try one of the more gourmet burgers.  I usually like medium well pinkies, but they seem to prefer a medium rare. Apparently you can ask they cook more well, which I will do.  Or, I will get the house made veggie burger my daughter ordered.  She said it was great and it looked to be so.","One of the best burgers in Seattle! I got the crimini mushroom burger and cheese curds and demolished it all! Highly recommend the sriracha mayo dipping sauce.

Also, ive been on the hunt for really good fried cheese curds. These have been the best ones since I moved from Minneapolis.

Def come here and try the food! There are HH specials monday - fri too.",Easy to order online and food was ready upon arrival only 10 minutes from ordering. Tough to get fresh and hot with drive time of 10 minutes back home.  Miss eating as food comes off the grill. Would like to try again when we can eat fresh. Dad really enjoyed the salmon burger which had a large fresh slab of fresh salmon.  Fries were just ok.  Cheese curds had very light breading as we enjoy.,"We went here for the first time this week for take away, it was very quick and easy. About 10-20 min from order to pick up. 

We ordered 2 mushroom burgers and added bacon to one, plus regular fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. 

The burger was nice and juicy, nicely cooked (medium is their default) the potato bun was great and sturdy - soaking up the burger juices. The bacon was a little underwhelming - it is $2+ and hardly noticeable in the burger. 

The fries were delicious - we asked for extra crispy which they certainly followed. 
The onion rings were basically just battered/fried, couldn&apos;t really taste any onion in them.","Love the burgers here. Juicy with the right toppings. Always on the money! I love their mushroom and Swiss cheese one and is my staple. 
The thing I have to have on my visit are sweet potato fries with the habanero mayo! Fries are very lightly bartered that gives them the crunch and the sweetness of the potatoes comes through and finally when dipped in that salty spicy habanero mayo - it gives a kick of crunchiness and sweetness and spiciness all in one - in every bite!!","One of our favorite burger spots in Seattle!

I&apos;m afraid to say that I got my 4 year degree from UW and never stopped by this place. Always drove right by it on my way to Paseos lol (Un Bien now). Man, was I missing out! The burgers are a really good size so you&apos;ll be plenty full. The burger patties are super juicy and nicely cooked. My favorite is the mushroom burger. My wife likes the standard hamburger with a lettuce wrap, which doesn&apos;t sound that great to a carnivore like me, but she says it&apos;s the best lettuce wrap hamburger she&apos;s ever eaten and I&apos;ll take her word for it. 

The fries and onion rings are great too. A little too oily maybe? But if you&apos;re getting a burger, fries and onion rings, you should expect a little grease hangover. 

If you&apos;re in the Fremont/Wallingford/UW/greenlake area, you should give this place a shot.","Best burger in Seattle. I ordered the Big Bison, onion rings, the salad, and the blueberry lemon hard cider. Everything was SO delicious! I&apos;ll be back soon!","Seemed a grip too trendy for my taste, but the couple I was meeting up was treating so I wasn&apos;t gonna fuss. Besides they bought my book, so I wanted another positive interaction. 

My burger choice must&apos;ve been new because it&apos;s not on the menu. All the fixings with red onion jam. Now I like red onions, I like jam. However I do not like red onion jam, Sam I am. It was a texture and taste issue. Thankfully I ordered on the side but it was the essence of the burger so most likely insulting the cook. 

Please bus (clean) your own table before departure.","After being let down more than once by Seattle&apos;s more acclaimed fancy food places, a simple burger from Uneeda Burger was all weneeded. 

Most places serve either plain jane burgers or more higher-end gourmet ones. What I really liked about Uneeda Burger was that they offered a mix of no-frills and fancy burgers. 
You can go for just a burger with their Classic ($5.50), which is exactly what it sounds like - patty, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, pickles. They do offer add-ons like cheese, eggs, bacon etc. Or you can go for a higher-end burger like their Big Bison Burger ($15), a bison patty w/ red onion jam, bacon, beecher&apos;s cheddar. 

For myself, I had the Mushroom Burger ($9.50). At first I was considering other burgers cause I thought it&apos;d be a mushroom patty in lieu of an actual beef patty, BUT NO. It&apos;s beef + a truckload of mushrooms and flavor! They used crimini &amp; porcini mushrooms, black truffle salt, gruyere, and shallots. Yes, it was a super rich burger, and just what I needed. 

After a long day of seeing weird things and eating weird things, Uneeda Burger was the perfect comfort food burger place for us. It&apos;s located in Fremont, close to the Fremont troll (half a mile away), so if you wanna see more weird stuff, it&apos;s just down the street!","We splurged on burgers and fries today, not good for me in any way, shape or form, but a risk is necessary every once in a while. 

A long and self-indulgent life has allowed me to experience some of the best things available on this planet. I have been spoiled, and I am difficult to wow. Uneeda burgers were good, I&apos;ve had better. Sobelman&apos;s in Milwaukee, Wisconsin has great burgers, and compared to Sobelman&apos;s and other great burgers I tasted, Uneeda&apos;s are just good. The classic and blue are good, and may make you very happy.  Being spoiled limits my chances for that &quot;high,&quot; that &quot;buzz.&quot; It happens, but it has to be damn special. Uneeda wasn&apos;t damn special.","Great burgers and hand cut fries. Perfect option if you&apos;re gluten free since they have a dedicated fryer and gluten free buns. 

Didn&apos;t get a chance to eat inside due to the current situation in Seattle, but they had a beautiful patio and charming restaurant space! 

The burgers were extremely flavorful and huge. The fries were hand cut and fried to perfection.

Great local Seattle restaurant. Especially if you need a gluten free burger fix!",A really great to come for a few drinks or a few too many. The owner is one of the nicest people ever who wants nothing but the best for everyone who comes in.,Excellent management! Had a great time there recently for a husky game. They had great socially distanced outdoor seating and their beer towers are a must!,"I hung out here for quite a while while I was waiting for someone. Everyone I met was very nice and they have a variety of sports on the tvs for people who are interested (not me, haha). Great hours, great prices, and plenty of beer options! They even have funky options like a fuzzduster mix of two Elysian beers. Not my thing, but still fun to try.
Good amount of parking is available too. I will definitely be back!","The food was five stars, the ambiance was four. We&apos;d heard from a coworker that this place was better than the reviews make it seem, and I&apos;d agree. I ordered a turkey club with fries (amazing, served with pickles and just exactly what I was craving) and he ordered the Erik Kobe burger (cheddar, roasted garlic black pepper aioli, crispy fried onion, onion bun; like a fast food burger but in a good way), and also the tots (extra good, well seasoned). Anyway, the food was good. We sat outside in a parking lot which wasn&apos;t excellent, even under the &quot;covered&quot; section it was nothing to look at. Overall four stars.","Food was awful. We were next door at Fremont and ordered to go, do not recommend. Not worth the money, the fries were so greasy they were wet, the flatbread was soggy with wet tomato on top contributing to the sogginess. The fish and chips were so tough they could have bean chicken tenders and the fish tacos were the same. Save your money, and time and tastebuds. Go anywhere else!!",The Dock is my favorite bar and grill! Awesome staff and the owners Mike and Shelly are the best. Great food and my fave are the cheese curds (Tom). My recommendation is to visit the Dock after visiting Gas Works Park or a UW game.,"The food here was decent but my kale salad was slathered in dressing when I ordered it with dressing on the side. The cheese curds were good standard pub fare. The options for beers on tap were not the most interesting, but they had a few good options. 

We came for trivia night (Weds) and found it really hard to hear the host and for people coming and going to close the front door. This was really annoying and would keep me from returning until summer when it&apos;s not freezing outside.

There were two bartenders working hard all night and they were nice despite being slammed. The small parking lot out front was great for me as there were two spots open when I arrived. Unfortunately for my friend joining me, arriving just after 7:30pm on trivia night meant she had to park about 4 blocks away.","I love coming here, taco Tuesdays are great. You can&apos;t beat $1 tacos. Great food and good drinks. The bartenders are on point. If Christian is working he always has a smile on his face and can crack a joke with the best of them. 
IE. He will do push ups for a good Yelp review.","By far the best group of bartenders and owners anyone could ask for. Food was great, hospitality was beyond impeccable and the atmosphere was perfectly fitting. They take amazing care of their customers. Definitely worth stopping in!",Very upset. Let me know that &quot;the bar was most important&quot; when I asked where my food was. We waited over 40 minutes for any sort of notice to our table. No one apologies except for in a very sarcastic voice. Do not recommend coming here unless it&apos;s empty and you can ensure immediate service.,"Ordered via Postmates, my mistake I guess. 
Got charged many additional fees from the merchant without being notified before checkout. 
The food was fucking horrendous. It&apos;s almost like I was being trolled. How do you make nachos soggy, and burnt at the same time? 
Or a burger taste like fish?
How much did each entree cost, you ask? 
$25 a piece. Check out these beautiful $25 chips. 

I played myself I guess. Thanks for the crappy food, bros!","3-star food but 5 star service in a great location (right next to the Fremont Brewing Company)!

We stopped in while waiting for laundry to finish and ended up with nachos (me) and a burger (boyfriend). I seriously can&apos;t say enough good things about the server/bartender. I forget her name but she was super friendly, knowledgable about the menu, and honestly made the whole place seem more inviting!

The prices are good for what you get, the portions are filling, and it has a very chill Fremont vibe. Great place to hangout and watch whatever game you desire! We will definitely be going back to explore the menu and brew selection.","The bartender, Christian E, was a complete and utter asshole. We came here with 10 people and he was incredibly rude to all of us, individually...mind you there was one other table at this awful bar at the time. We are Seattle natives and will never return to this venue. I cannot believe the disgusting and demeaning things that he said to our group. I hope that you will not visit this restaurant/bar.

Definitely NOT an &apos;inviting space for entertaining large parties with an outdoor deck&apos;, and does NOT create a &apos;fun, happy, safe environment&apos;, as their website states. He also tried to charge us for drinks we did not order....and when questioned, he said he would check the surveillance video. When we stated that we would appreciate if he did so, he said that it would &apos;be easier for him to remove the drink from the tab&apos;. I am appalled by the behavior of this bartender, and hope that management will step in.","We like Taco Tuesday, but people standing just outside blowing cigarette smoke into the open door is not a great situation.",This place is horrible. The manager was very rude to us right off the start and assumed we opened/propped open the back door even thought it was like that when we walked in. Food took OVER AN HOUR and they told us &quot;the bar was more important.&quot; and &quot;it is what it is&quot;. One meal never even came and Once the food arrived it was cold. We will not be back.,"The dock will hook it up on the  nachos, let you drink from a tasty and well rounded selection of beers and has an awesome feel to the place. When you walk in you feel like you should be interested in sports of one kind or another and in the summer the back dock is really fun to watch games at. I would say the dock is my favorite sports bar in Fremont.","Fun dive bar!  We stopped by while waiting up for some people and got a drink which was good (The margarita is sweet but good!).  Our service was a little odd.  

It seemed like they were under staffed as our waitress was very confused and they do a weird thing with your card where she gives it back to you after you first order, even if you leave the tab open.  I got one drink and said I would close my tab - so when she brought me my card back, she said she would bring the bill when I was ready to go (We were going to sit for a bit) but it then just created more work for her later and confusion on if she needed my card again.

Would definitely come watch a game here with a big group or something though, it is very relaxed!","Giving them a 1 was hard to do. Sunday morning 10:15 am, 5 people in the entire place. Had to wait almost 40 minutes for food, 15 minutes just to get a coffee refil. Then I finally get my breakfast sandwich with burnt sausage in it. Didn&apos;t want to send it back because I didn&apos;t have another 40 minutes to wait. Response I got was sorry it took so long. Horrible service, bad food. Have been there before and never this bad. I guess some people don&apos;t like to work Sunday mornings. Good way to lose customers","Came here for the Rams vs the Chiefs, game of the season. Monday night! They killed the games for Trivia! 
Read this: this is not a sports bar! NOT A SPORTS BAR.","Food : 5/5     Price : 4/5     Service : 5/5

Been coming to The Dock for 5 years now. The menu has changed slightly and added some fun items. The one thing I get 80% of the time is their Juicy Lucy burger. Melted cheese inside the burger is just awesome. Along side with tots, makes a solid lunch. Other recommendation I would make is their Fish and Chips, those are also very very good. The Dock serves your usual pub/bar food, with good quality.

Beer cost is about right, it&apos;s a bar after all. The food cost I personally think it can be a tiny bit lower. A burger in my opinion should not cost $16, it&apos;s a burger. Even tho I don&apos;t necessarily agree with the cost, I do still visit and get myself a nice burger because it is delicious. I

The service has improved a lot over the past 5 years. Food and service are lot faster, the staffs are very friendly and the owner (I believe she&apos;s the owner) is always around with a nice smile. It is a good time for watching sports and all. There are also karaoke nights if you&apos;re into karaoke.","Standard dive / sports bar. No joke--I&apos;ve mostly coke here to drink and watch the Zags play. The selection of beer is not bad, food (my go to is the cheese curds) is served relatively quick and there&apos;s not a bad seat in the house. During the spring/summer you can drink on the back patio. No dogs allowed unless they&apos;re service animals.","Pacific Inn Pub has been a favorite Covid-friendly spot to grab beer and food. It is super divey which I love and the staff is very friendly. The have a covered outdoor seating area, it does get pretty cold so you definitely have to bundle up, but I&apos;d say it&apos;s worth it. I&apos;ve come in on a couple weekend evenings and it&apos;s never been too busy.

They have good local drafts and some of the best fish and chips I&apos;ve tried in Seattle, especially considering how affordable this place is. I&apos;m looking forward to trying their other food!","This is a dive bar - please know this when you see the 5-star rating.  These stars are not awarded for decor, ambiance, craft cocktails, or beautiful presentation.  They are awarded for fried fish.  Beautiful, delicious, perfectly fried fish. 

The fish and chips here are among the very best in Seattle.  Whether you live in town or are just visiting, they are easily worthy of a stop.  The cod is fresh as can be, and they are breaded to perfection and fried to a deep golden brown.  The tarter sauce is homemade and the chips are excellent too.  

In the before times I would meet friends here for a few games of pool and a pitcher of Rainier to go with the goods.  These days I get takeout, but the food&apos;s just as yummy as it&apos;s always been.  They even give you a vinegar packet to go - something I was super happy about when I got home because I forgot to ask!

Thanks for being awesome PI.  Keep on keepin&apos; on, and I&apos;ll keep on coming back for more.","Pre-COVID times, this was my favorite neighborhood dive bar to end my night at. They always had the favorites on draft and it has a very low key vibe!

One thing remains the same even during COVID times is how good their food is! I am a big fan of their fish and chips, but hands down, you have to try the Cajun battered fried shrimp that is served with coleslaw and fries! The portion is generous and they fry them to perfection with such a lovely batter coating. I&apos;m salivating just thinking of them! Anyways, just give it a try for next dinner!","This is definitely a perfect place for me to have a few drinks.

It&apos;s small, chill, and the staff and customers are all very friendly.

The drinks are awesome, and strong! Prices are pretty reasonable. Actually probably cheaper than most places. Margaritas are 7.50. most places charge at least $10 for any mixed drinks.

Pool is 75 cents. 

Apparently the fish and chips are supposed to be amazing here.

Make sure Brad makes your drink and tell him Lee says hello!","I knew I wanted to get fish and chips on our visit to Seattle, so when I got a local recommendation for Pacific Inn Pub I added it to my list. Located in what seems to be a bit of an up and coming area with lots of restaurants, Pacific Inn Pub is a throwback divey bar with affordable drinks and food. It was pretty busy when we stopped in but were able to grab some seats at the bar and eventually move to a booth.

My boyfriend and I ordered a two piece fish and chips to split. It comes with coleslaw. The fish was super crispy on the outside but a little overcooked inside. I think it&apos;s just cod but the price is pretty great. I loved the fries as they were a bit greasy, and the coleslaw was tangy, sweet, crisp, refreshing, and not overly dressed. I liked the experience of going here (has some serious Cottage Inn vibes for Grand Rapids people) and would make this a regular spot if I lived in the area! Not the best fish and chips I&apos;ve ever had but a solid choice at the price point.","3 piece order of fish and chips was a lot of fish.  Funky waterfront atmosphere.  Jusrt remember that the big guy at the door is there to help you, LOL.  A must go to place if you like fish and chips with a cold beer.","Support Local

I forgot to take the food photo because I was starving and it smelled way too good! I asked my friends where&apos;s the best fish and chips in Seattle, and they either said Ivars or Pacific Inn Pub, I finally have a change to try both within the same month. Since pacific inn pub is only a minute away from me, everyone highly recommended it, so I ordered a takeout because there was way too many people on a Tuesday night. 
It has fish, chips and coleslaw. The fish are crispy and doesn&apos;t taste fishy, that&apos;s how you know they seasoned it well and it&apos;s fresh, also it is bigger than Ivars. Chips and coleslaw are okay, can&apos;t really rate it since it&apos;s only fries. Also the price is fairly cheap. 
I personally prefer this place more than ivars but everyone has different preferences. 

Food:10/10
Service: 9/10 
Environment:8/10","This is one of our go to bars! Local, unpretentious and yummy bites! 

We love Pac Inn! The guys running the bar daily are awesome! Super chill, friendly but pumping out food and drinks non stop!

They have great fried food! Shrimp, fries, tots, wings, fish etc. Always perfectly fried!

We come here to watch sports, get drinks and eat. We always leave full and satisfied.

Stoneway is getting busy and fancy but PAC Inn is at the bottom of the hill still doing them. Love it! Seattle bar here with good character and they have outdoor seating.

I can&apos;t say enough good things about them. They&apos;re busy daily and I hope they stay forever!","Pretty good fish and chips. 
Maybe a bit over cooked in the deep fryer but still yummy.
Good service and friendly wait staff. Food came out fairly quick. I came for the food cuz I was craving the fish and chips, not really much of a drinker, definitely a bar first- restaurant second. Lots of ppl doing their Friday night pre-funk drinking early in the evening here.","Im torn with this review. 

On one hand the fish&amp;chips were amazing. Ranks in the top 3 for sure. The crust was perfect and tasty. 

On the other hand this was the absolute worst service i have ever had. The &quot;waitress&quot; saw me sit down at the bar, made eye contact with me then moved on to the other customers in the restaurant. She came back and made eye contact with me again and then checked on the other customers for a second time. Next time she made eye co tact with me i had to wave hello to have her acknowledge i was a customer. She came over and said how can i help? This struck me as an odd question so i said &quot;may i see a menu ???&quot; She grabbed a menu slapped it i front of me and walked away to check on the other customers 2 more times before i had to wave her down again. She then asked for my order by saying &quot;what do you want?&quot;. I got my food fairly quickly and she came back by slapped the food down, yelled eleven bucks, grabbed my card and came back and THREW the card and receipt at me. 

There are too many good restaurants in this city to put up with terrible serv


Update:

The star ratings here should be based on food alone. This was the best god damn plate of fish and chips ive ever had. It deserves 5 stars even if i was treated like a sack of garbage while going through the ordering process.",Ok here&apos;s the deal..this place is the place for your fish and chips fix serves the best fish and chips. Period,After you get over the dingy smell and atmosphere of the place it really was a great little spot. The service is friendly and quick. Seems to have lots of regulars as well. I had the rueben and a an americano. The rueben was very standard and made correctly. My friend ordered the fried fish sandwich and told it was one of the best he has ever had. He was also looking forward to sharing with his dad about the sandwich he enjoyed it so much.,"I have had fish and chips all over the US, UK, Ireland...you name it. There is something about the fish and chips here. THEY ARE HANDS DOWN THE BEST.

To top it off its a fun locals dive bar. Quirky vibes, nice patio, cheap drinks/food.

I love the surrounding neighborhood as well. Lots of things to do and very walk-able. The Pacific Inn will always be a go-to stop when I am in town!","I&apos;d seen the Pacific Inn Pub on an old episode of Triple-D, so when I recently found myself (1) in Fremont and (2) craving fish &apos;n chips it was a natural stop. I arrived during a surprisingly busy lunch hour, but found the last seat at the bar (yay for being solo!) and was quickly greeted. I took a look at a menu even though I already knew what I wanted!  While the bartender grabbed me a pint of local goodness I had to do a double-take at how good the fish &apos;n chips prices were. In a city where it&apos;s easy to pay upwards of $15 for a small plate of them, these puppies were priced at $9.95 - phenomenal.

My order arrived quickly and, wow. It did not disappoint. My 2-piece order included 3 pieces (the bartender said because they were small - but they were huge!) and they were hot and tender on the inside with the most deliciously seasoned, crunchy batter on the outside. The fries were no slouch either - they tasted house-made and were perfect dipped in the delicious tartar sauce.

It will be hard for me not to stop here more often - I was out of there for well under $20 including tax and tip, which is pretty cheap for lunch (and a beer) in the big city. Bonus: there&apos;s free parking out back!","This is definitely a mom &apos;n pop local bar with great fish and chips for the price. We came soon after they opened on a Sunday and the place was pretty dead. You have to be 21 to enter and no outside food or drink allowed. They had 3 very large TVs right above the bar. Service was fast and friendly.

Now for the food. I&apos;ll be honest. You&apos;re not coming here for the best fish you&apos;ve ever had. You&apos;re coming here for great fried fish and chips at a great price. The type that you want to down with a beer or two and don&apos;t mind getting your fingers dirty for. The type that you want to dip in tartar sauce and just keep eating. The batter is very crunchy but doesn&apos;t add much flavor so the tartar sauce is a must. The fries are also super crispy as well and slaw perfectly delectable and better than more expensive establishments in the area. Plenty of local beer and cider options on tap and in the bottle to choose from and great place to hang out or watch a game.","Grate(ful) place to be, especially while on psychedelics.  At least, that&apos;s what I&apos;m told.  Pretty far out classic dive, man.","I love Pacific Inn. It&apos;s such a Wallingford gem, in a wonderful dive bar sort of way. I live for their fish sandwiches. Their fish and chips and burgers are also really good. And they make surprisingly good cocktails. Zero pretention, good food, good drinks, great dive bar.

They&apos;re also doing a really good job handling covid precautions, better than most places I&apos;ve seen. All the staff was wearing masks correctly, good distancing, and all of the doors were open. Limited indoor and outdoor seating was available. I really appreciated their efforts to keep everyone safe.","I went out of my way to get here as I recall the late Anthony Bourdain raved about this place. After trekking from the airport, doing some last minute shopping downtown, I was starving and really excited, only to be let down. I have nothing against dive bars, but this is a dive with dirty carpet that doesn&apos;t look like its been changed since opening day. It even faintly smells like beer is spilled on a daily basis.
I was rather annoyed as when I sat down, I was approached by the gentleman with the potbelly and beard (sorry, I did not get his name), after ordering water instead of alcohol, he pretty much did not have anything else to do with me. I waited for 10-15 minutes before I finally went to the bar and asked to order food. The female apologized and came to my table for my order.
I ordered the fish and chips and while the seasoning was good, it was a tad bit too salty. I usually have great seafood when I am in Seattle, but this time was not one of them.","Is there a reason he wasn&apos;t happy with us because the bartender was so rude straight off the bat. We were polite, waited for him to get free and started to place the order when he asked me what I wanted - I said I wasn&apos;t sure and he just walked away. And when I realized he was walking, I said ok just get me what they&apos;re having. And then he mimics me &quot;oh she&apos;s just going to have what they&apos;re having.&quot; And when I tried to order food, he scoffed and didn&apos;t listen. It was annoying and a real buzz kill. Later on, I asked him if he could give me a glass for the water dispenser because I couldn&apos;t see where they were...and he starts imitating my eyeglasses -like a &quot;oh they&apos;re right in front of you, four-eyes&quot; kind of thing. Took me some time to find where the were kept (right tucked behind the water dispenser), but all he needed to do was either point or tell me.

I guess I&apos;m more frustrated because he was happy and chatty with all the other groups and I can&apos;t figure out what happened with us/was it a racism thing/he had a bad day/or...?! 

Otherwise, food was fine (fish and chips and tots), ambiance is your typical Seattle dive bar but kind of more grungy since it has carpeted 1990s floor. I&apos;ll try my best not to go back, but who knows.‚Äç","Came here for tipsy eats to end my birthday celebration. The food lived up to the hype. We ordered the fish and chips, a Ruben sandwich, plus onion rings. Everything was just tasty fried goodness. The place itself is the embodiment of a dive.","Love coming here where you can sit outside and Lake Union is right there. It feels COVID safe. The tables had enough space. Some outside seating is by a protective cover for rainy/windy weather but the bottom part is open so you&apos;re still getting a lot of airflow. 

5 stars for the service. They were very friendly and attentive. 

5 stars for the ambiance with the outside seating.

5 stars for a place where you can enjoy some oysters and bubbly.

We ordered the fish and chips, and I feel like I&apos;ve had better in Seattle. It wasn&apos;t horrible. But it wasn&apos;t my favorite. So that&apos;s really my only criticism. 

I will definitely come back to sit outside and order oysters, and I highly recommend it for that.","I found this restaurant on Open Table and am so glad we made the reservation. The atmosphere is lovely, the prices are very reasonable, the food is delicious, the drinks are good, solid beer, wine, and spirits selection, and the service is on point. My husband and I shared a dozen oysters, and he had a beer while I had the Seattle Sour. The Seattle Sour was good, but a tad too sweet for me. If you like cocktails on the sweeter side, you&apos;ll love this. If you&apos;re expecting a more boozy flavored cocktail I&apos;d go with something else. We then split the salmon dip appetizer which was so yummy, my husband ordered the seafood poutine and I ordered the seafood stew. All of it was so delicious. We had one main server but throughout our visit multiple servers stopped by to take away dishes promptly or just make sure we were enjoying our food and drinks. We&apos;ll definitely be returning. 

Just a little FYI though, I&apos;m assuming because of the the small indoor seating section they had to keep the windows and doors open for COVID reasons. It does make it a little chilly in there at night with the wind coming in off the water, so bring a jacket or sweater if you get cold easily. Also note that the parking lot for the area is paid parking. It was $7 for the evening so not bad at all. I hope you enjoy this place as much as I did!","Loved the large outdoor patio here! It has a gorgeous view of lake union. Definitely one of our favorite outdoor seating places in Seattle!

We ordered the seafood poutine and burger to share. The poutine was amazing! Everything about it was good, especially the clam chowder was a nice spin instead of the normal gravy. We weren&apos;t very impressed with the burger. It wasn&apos;t very flavorful and the bread was dry. 

Definitely will be coming back whenever the weather is nice outside an will try other things on the menu!","I really wanted to like this place but after the second visit I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;d like to come back. I&apos;ve been here pre covid (summer 2019) and recently last month. 

Location: The outdoor patio seating is great on warm days and is a decent option for cold seasons as well. The tables were spaced out and there were plenty of heaters to keep warm. The view of the water and space needle was a nice plus! We got to enjoy the sunset. 

Oysters: are delicious and fresh, great selection 

Food: no longer have HH food options, only drinks. Fettucine was delicious but small portions for the price. I love the poutine of the sea and the calamari. 

Service: First visit was great. Second visit. JUST AWFUL. It might have been an off day for the server but the whole experience was so negative. I forgot to get the name of the male server but he didn&apos;t really seem happy to seat/serve us. From ordering drinks to food and paying, each interaction was just uncomfortable. Our heater at our table kept turning off and our whole table was hesitant on asking to turn it back on because it felt like we were bothering him. 

Pro tip: make a reservation if you end up coming here, tables are limited.",Outdoor tent obstructs the views but I appreciate the effort they went into to provide heat lamps! Menu is a little overpriced but likely due to their waterfront  location. I wanted to get the steamed clams but all the pictures were of the poutine fries so I got that instead. I should&apos;ve just got the clams because the clams on the toppings were soooo good and juicy!! The poutine was also good but salty for my taste. The fries were also wonderfully crispy. Would love to come back in the summertime.,"COVID-TIMES REVIEW:
Open indoor and outside during Covid times.  Outdoor seating has a large white tent with space heaters, covered patio seating with mostly decorative heaters, and one picnic bench with a cute bubble.  I (and others after me) found the tent was no warmer than the covered patio seating, it was totally dependent on how close to the heater you were and the breeze.  The tent also lacked views of the water in an attempt to protect diners from the breeze.  I brought a large blanket and was quite comfortable bundled up for fall night air in patio seating.  A sign said outdoor seating would be available Year Round.

All staff was masked, there were hand sanitizers available at the entrance, and they delivered a small spray bottle with your check (A nice touch!).  I watched staff wiping down tables and chairs thoroughly.  The kitchen staff is easily viewable with masks and gloves.

Seating indoor was very limited, maybe 4-6 tables 12 feet apart along the wall.  Only 2 groups were inside, the outside seating was far more popular, probably due to the views.

The food was lovely: had the chowder, caesar brussel sprouts, and the brisket dip. Drinks were also solid, what I&apos;d expect from $12-15 cocktails.  Would suggest the spiced hot cider.",It is all fresco and very busy over the weekend.  Got the rotating punch and it is a small world Aperol.  Both were very fruity with strawberry bits on the bottom of the Aperol drink.  Also the Katy Peary and Impeachmint drink as well.  All drinks were good.   Fried corn was good.  Had cheese and paprika on top.  Smoked salmon dip with capers on top went well with the thick potato chips.  Shrimp tacos were ordered because the waitress orders it everyday.  It was seasoned well and a definite must get.,Oysters....BOMB. Chowder is great. Cute outside seating with heaters but definitely would recommend making a reservation as seats are limited. By the docks too!,"I really liked this place! The waterfront patio, fresh oysters and bottle of bubbles is exactly what I needed on a beautiful Seattle summer day. My friends and I enjoyed our server so much, that we stayed longer than we intended to, which was great, because it gave us time to order lots of delicious plates off the menu. The oysters were so yummy, fresh and bright, and the fried corn was flavorful with color and texture. I look forward to coming back here and diving deeper into the menu and those cocktails.",Love the atmosphere here!! All of their cocktails are amazing! Wonderful place to go with friends for happy hour or to be near the water for a sunset dinner,"Do come here for the oysters. They are fresh, have a great variety and are okay priced...but its more about the variety and ability to intermix everything. Think sushi menu with a pencil and a list, but in this case oysters. Apparently in October, which I was 1 day short, they are having Oyster October with $1/oyster! Everyday will have a special oyster; what a great idea!

The food menu is limited and everything seemed to take a while to get the food. This was fine because I was conversing with a friend, but it was a long time. 

I ended up not getting dinner here because I asked if they could put salmon on a salad, and I was told they had trout. Aaaaand I am not even joking, the manager/or whatever said, &quot;Trout is basically salmon.&quot; I about died, call me a salmon snob because I am from the Northwest, but yeah NO Salmon is never like trout...salmon is never like anything; it has a unique taste!!

The drinks are also great, and they have a great selection of liquor and beer at the bar. The bar is also quite hopping if you like a lively place. The  patio is also nice, but I imagine service out there is even slower. 

Overall I do like the White Swan for drinks and oysters. I will come back for that and the nice view.  I guess keep in mind this is technically a &quot;Public House&quot; aka pub, and not a restaurant.","Great place for happy hour or drinks/light food on South Lake Union.

Went here on a Saturday with a friend for the first time. We&apos;ve been wanting to go here, so I was surprised what a casual feel it was in comparison to what it seemed like on the website. I liked it, and we sat outside on the railing overlooking the water. My friend had already ordered, and they brought us out oysters ($3.50 each but going down to $1 in October) first - they were really creamy and delicious, and the mignonette was so flavorful - it was a well-balanced combination.

Then, we were brought our poutine o&apos; the sea (the real reason we came) - fries covered in clam chowder and a some whole clams. YUM! I don&apos;t know who would order this for a real meal, but this is the perfect app to split among a few people. The wine was fine, none of the wines we had were standouts. 

The one reason I give it a 4 star vs. a 5 for a great drink place: the ordering is a bit confusing. You order at the front, but then pick up (with a number they give you) at the bar, but then they bring your food outside. I&apos;m not sure if this is the process all the time, but it was the night we were there.

Overall though, it was a scenic location with some excellent menu items to chat over. I will definitely be bringing out of town people here for a casual on-the-water experience.","Waterfront! Patio can be dog friendly. 

Been here several times now for birthdays/group outings. I live on the lake so I walk by here everyday with my puppy. Dining here isn&apos;t as peaceful. 

Love: their spritz, dill fries and oysters. 
Dislike: long lines and drink/food ordering process. 

Food is good if you manage to order them in time. The bar outside now close at 9 pm. Which is a shame since it is much cooler and more comfortable after sunset on the lake. 

The bar outside seems to be always slammed/understaffed. They ran out of clean glasses, utensils etc at time so you couldn&apos;t order more. Feel like they could use more help with the staff. 

But the food is good even without the drinks. The clams, fish and chips, Brussels sprouts, kale salad! Probably come back on less busier time but it is on the lake and the weather has been amazing. Doubt it&apos;ll be less busy anytime soon.","Great location on SLU with lots of parking nearby and a huge outdoor patio (dogs allowed!)

Love their cocktails and oysters as they have been consistently fresh the last two times I was there. Food plates are small and not very filling but the food is always great. We had the brussel sprouts, scallops ceviche, hanger steak (really tiny), octopus and clams (very small portion). We enjoyed every dish but everyone at the table was hungry afterwards and I think the bill still came out to like 40-50 per person. So the food is a bit pricey for the portion size. 

But in the summer, you are paying for the outdoor atmosphere because it&apos;s so nice!",I was really excited to eat here. We waited until dinner on our last night in Seattle to go and sadly they did not have much available on the menu including oysters. The staff was nice and the drinks were yummy but I was disappointed at the end of the meal.,"Yaass.  great view, great food and very decent drink selection.

Octopus?  yes!
Oysters?  I mean why did you even come here- Hell to the YES!
Dranks?  Um...see above

The staff are super fun.  Only bummer is the pay to park private lot which sucks. But their is public parking just down the road so if you don&apos;t mind walking off or on your food could save you a few bucks.","If you guys get a chance to try this place please do!! I got the shrimp fettuccine &amp; it was so good!! Great customer service, amazing drinks &amp; a beautiful view!","Horrifying attitude from the hostess I experienced today will never have me go back. We&apos;ve dined here many times and generally, most staff members are nice and friendly. However the unnecessary attitude with passive aggressive, rude tone of the hostess really put a bad taste in my mouth today (and from the past). We are so glad we didn&apos;t end up staying and found another place to dine. Managers, hostess, if you&apos;re reading this review, please consider this as room for improvement as you have many other selling factors to have returning customers. I am so disgusted with your hostess&apos; manner, that I don&apos;t even want to think twice about going back. The hostess said, &quot;you&apos;re more than welcome to dine somewhere else,&quot; and raised her voice with me. My gosh, I do not want to spend a single dime or a minute in this kind of environment.","This restaurant has soooo much potential but they are seriously understaffed. We thought it was a restaurant but they have a limited menu and only two staff who are slinging drinks and taking orders. It&apos;s a beautiful day on the water and there is a huge line for food orders. 

We got the chowder, which was runny and not very good. The oysters were really good and fresh. 

If given the correct staffing set up, this place would kill it. 

I ordered a Moscow mule, which was delicious. 

Great view but lacking in food service and quality, which is a shame.","Great location on SLU and the service was good. Unfortunately, the food came up a little short. The oysters were 3.50 each and not good quality or properly shucked, there were bits of shell inside. The fries in the fish and chips were good because they were fresh and hot, but the fish was very dry. Crab Mac n cheese tasted okay but was overpriced and over salted. Overall, I would go back for drinks and maybe an appetizer like fries and to sit outside and enjoy the sun, but probably wouldn&apos;t eat a full meal here.","I ordered through grubhub to grab a sandwich for dinner and though it was ok.  I&apos;m surprise that this place is not on yelp as it seems like it&apos;s been here for a while (based on the grubhub reviews).  

Anyways, I got the carribean sandwich and the corn salsa.  The carribean sandwich was ok, nothing special.  The bread was soft but the chicken was kinda dry.  Also, it wasn&apos;t very carribean-ish.  Just a very standard sandwich.  And for $10+, i expected more as there are other great carribean sandwiches else where for the same price.  

The salsa on the  other hand was pretty good.  It was very generous in portion and has a little kick.  It was also very refreshing.  A good dish for a hot day.  

I wish they provided utensils or napkins with our orders as we were planning on walking around the neighbor hood while eating, but instead, have to go home first to grab some utensils.","We ate dinner here tonight because our first choice was unknowingly closed. Lucky for us this place was MAGNIFICENT!!! I&apos;m sorry I did not know about this place beforehand! The staff was super friendly and patient with my family who couldn&apos;t grasp COVID procedures! 

The food was super tasty and presented very well. And the art! Sweet baby cheese disks the art was spectacular. 

Thank you Greenlake Grill, I&apos;ll be seeing you soon!","Open and SAFE!!! Tables are distanced and all staff was wearing masks at all times. Made me feel very comfortable. Got mad love and respect for this kitchen staff and server staff for being on the frontlines. Would recommend over and over again. 

THEY HAVE TOGO COCKTAILS!!!!!",So yummy! Stopped in for lunch and had the cheeseburger and steak salad. Felt very safe with social distancing in place and servers wearing masks at all times. Kid menu had good selection as well.,"This place has a great atmosphere inside and out. The outside chairs are not the best but good enough for bar type food

Started with Mac cheese balls which was amazing and I want more, the sweet chili sauce is a must

The food is rather tasty. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich which I would come back again for.  It was even great for leftovers. The fries were acceptable for bar fries but not something I would come here for when you have that craving for fries.

Also ordered the prime rib dip was really good, and would get again 

Drink selection for alcohol was sufficient, mix drinks were pretty good. They did have a minimal beer selection

Atmosphere- bar","Just had an excellent time here. Staff was jovial and made me laugh which feels kind of rare to actually laugh out loud right now. If you&apos;ve been looking for a bit of friendly humanity and a few good jokes, I definitely recommend a seat at the bar for a drink and a chuckle.","So glad this place is back! For years it was the Greenlake Bar and Grill and was a neighborhood mainstay. Then they abruptly closed and reopened as Lunchbox Laboratory which served nothing but expensive, incredibly unhealthy burgers. But now the old mainstay is back, this time as the Greenlake Grill. A lot of the old menu favorites are back, and when I went in a lot of the old regulars were too. I used to eat here once a month before the terrible decision to become lunchbox laboratory. I suspect that will occur again now.",The food here is reliable. I enjoy the burgers. Great location by the park. My husband loves it. I have had experiences with a waitress who is a little rude,"Looking to move to the Greenlake area and stopped in here for a bite before meeting with my (potential) future landlord. A lot of the food on the menu looked pretty good, especially those roasted brussels sprouts with bacon (nomnomnom). I ended up going with chicken strips, which isn&apos;t something I typically order, but I needed some comfort food.  

The chicken strips came out pretty quickly, were very tasty and had more flavor than the typical bar fare. If you like cole slaw, their mustard slaw is pretty awesome; not too mustard-y, just enough to make it interesting. The fries were also good. I asked for BBQ sauce as well and it has a really nice smokiness (chipotle maybe?) to it, without being spicy (win). I later found out it was Sweet Baby Ray&apos;s with some embellishments. I do like some Sweet Baby Ray&apos;s, but I&apos;m not a fan of their HFCS. 

The space is really quite lovely and I could see how it would be really nice in the summers with the doors open to the sunlight and view of the lake.

BONUS: kids eat free on Wednesdays. I&apos;ll definitely be back with the kiddo, and to try their brussels sprouts.","Oh man... The food was A-Maz-Ing . Try the &apos;almost Ruben&apos; it&apos;s a turkey Ruben and it&apos;s fabulous! Server was super nice and helpful, and they are taking great precautions for spacing and cleaning!","Went to this place a little while before the quarantine measures started. I thought it had a neat ambiance and was in a cute area. The food was great and I felt the pricing was great (I was expecting it to be way more expensive, not sure why). It wasn&apos;t too crowded, but even if it had been, the way it&apos;s set up you wouldn&apos;t feel too close to anybody. And they were doing $3 mimosas which were great!","Not sure when the standard for French Dips, became using Ciabatta bread, but apparently it&apos;s a thingand uts bot even the bit crunchy.  I realize during Covid their are supply issues, but then say something or ask.  Apparently I&apos;m not dippin tonight.  Grrrr","My gf and I walked into this place, the host was nice and gracious. He seated us right away, but that&apos;s where the hospitality ends. We sat there for a good 10 minutes without even being looked at by the servers. The place was not too busy since it was a sunday afternoon, but I guess they were too busy for us. We sat there after 5 minutes of no service, we gave them another 5, and if no server approached us, we decided we would leave. Not sure if they were racist, since they didnt actually talk to us or made contact after the host seated us, but we were definitely ignored once seated.",Please note that this rating is based on the food. I literally turned into a greaseball after and had a heart attack. My boyfriend and I ordered the classic burger and holy guacamole the buns alone doused my little hands in oil so hard that the reflection from the light burned my eyebrows off (obviously exaggerating to get my point across. Thank G for eyebrows. Am I rite?) I would recommend the Caesar salad though. Service was chill too. If one glass of water is what you need.,"It&apos;s been a while since I had good comfort food until I came across this place. It was packed on Saturday evening but luckily we got seated right away. There are bar / non-bar / patio seatings that you can choose from depending on your preference and availability. The place itself is more spacious than it looked like from outside. 

We ordered spicy mac balls, cheesy classic burger, and nashville HOT chicken and waffles! 

*Spicy Mac Balls:
Habanero mac and cheese deep fried in panko breading! They were seasoned perfectly with the right amount of spice, giving out a perfect mild heat. Don&apos;t let the word &apos;spicy&apos; discourage you to try these heavenly balls! 

*Cheesy Classic Burger:
The ground chuck beef patty is very flavorful and juicy. They also combine cheddar and swiss cheese together which enhance the flavor even more. The bottomless fries are also well seasoned, way better than bland fries that you might find in other burger joints. 

*Nashville HOT chicken &amp; waffle:
When they capitalize the letter hot in the menu, it is meant to be HOT. As someone who dotes on spicy food, the heat is perfect for me but could be overwhelming for some people. My friend had to gulp down a full glass of water after taking a bite of the chicken. You can opt for traditional fried chicken instead. The fried chicken itself is impeccably fried and tender, not to mention you got 3 BIG size of chicken. The waffle is spot-on as well and drizzled with sweet syrup. If you ever order this dish, try to eat the chicken, waffle, and the pickle together at one bite! Sweet, salty, spicy, and sour taste will melt in your mouth! 

The service is top-notch! Our server was very friendly and attentive. 2 entrees + 1 app cost us ~$40 but it&apos;s totally worth it looking back at the food and service quality. I would suggest checking their happy hour menu, they have good deals and wide selection of drinks!","A very underwhelming experience overall. We were immediately drawn in with the promise of restaurant-wide happy hour, a definite plus! I got one of their signature happy hour cocktails, a raspberry mule. It was overly sweet for my taste. It had a ton of lime wedges in it, but wasn&apos;t tart at all. 

I ordered the HH chicken tacos. They came with tortilla chips, which I knew wouldn&apos;t be anything special, but why not serve the tacos with something slightly more exciting? The tacos were made with shredded chicken. The chicken was super liquidy. It reminded me of when I make shredded chicken in my crockpot, and there&apos;s a ton of liquid to contend with. I don&apos;t mind that at home, but I expect better if I&apos;m paying at a restaurant. The tacos were really boring. 

My husband got the balsamic blue cheese burger. The patty was premade, frozen. Not cooked medium rare. The burger was &quot;so what&quot; (my husband&apos;s words). The fries were good. 

The service was fine, the host was accommodating of our baby carrier and stroller. Our waitress was good.

Would not return.","Came here on New Year&apos;s Day, and it was obvious in overhearing the employees that they were hurting from last night&apos;s festivities. Still, they took it well enough in their attitudes towards customers that it wasn&apos;t glaring.

Place was hopping for 2pm on a Monday. Many swooning songs of regret for overindulgence the night before.

Onto the place. Much bigger than it appears when you walk inside. Bar area to the left, lounge/waiting area immediately to the right. Kitchen is immediately behind bar, stairs leading to &quot;formal&quot; seating areas just off to the right behind lounge. Expansive area once you start heading up the stairs. Not conducive for someone on crutches or a wheelchair. Very clean overall.

Wife and I ordered burgers, the Swiss-something something and she the Mediterranean. 

The Swiss burger was 8oz Kobe Beef, Mushrooms, Onions, Swiss, and a fresh roll. The swiss was way too strong for the burger, that was the dictator on the bun. While it was obvious the quality of the ingredients was there, the flavors overall could not compete with the swiss cheese. 

My burger&apos;s temperature was appropriate, wife&apos;s was well done (she requested medium).

My wife and I agreed that when the most memorable thing about a burger was the bun, that&apos;s a problem. 

Side salad was an up-charge, and while good its portion was petite. I did appreciate them bowling it as the entree plates were appropriately pre-heated for the burgers. Or we were lucky and the dishwasher was unloaded at the right time. 

Ordered a bloody mary, the lime on the bloody was blatantly bad - almost rotten. Shame on the staff for allowing it to leave the wait window that way. Bloody was under-mixed, leading to a very watered down start with weird layering. 

Overall the experience could be better. There&apos;s enough good here to meet friends at their suggestion, but w/o some type of voucher I won&apos;t go back on my own.","Great location, nice outdoor seating. Big mimosas, breakfast was ok.
The service was pretty good. 
It&apos;s a great spot because of the location. The food is good but nothing special.","I had the most disappointing birthday lunch possible here. Our server was okay. He seemed like he&apos;d just finished his server training, though-- checking in after a few bites of our main to ask how it was, basically ignoring us after that check in until the check drop and mandatory &quot;dessert check in.&quot; 

I ordered a monthly special, which I should definitely not have done, as the dish was far from well-executed. I ordered a prosciutto sandwich (please see photo), which was actually sliced ham and didn&apos;t even cover half of the bread. I asked for no mayo, since I hate it, and got it so I was virtually unable to eat my sandwich and with a dining companion who finds it intolerably rude to say something or send food back. 

Fries were cold, so I didn&apos;t even get to eat my side. The fish tacos seemed ok. The appetizer we shared was good, though-- fried cauliflower with sriracha yogurt.  

I also really hated that despite having loads of open tables, the inept hostess sat an annoying couple right next to us (LOTS OF OTHER TABLES, LADY).","I stopped in here while walking around Green Lake chasing Pokemon.  I ate in the bar inside, but there is also a lot of seating outside.

They have a good selection of bars on tap.  I had a hefeweizen. I started with hummus and pita bread.  It was really good, obviously fresh and thick.  Just delicious.  

I followed this up with fish tacos.  The fish and tortillas were good, but too much slaw and sauce.  They were much better when I scraped some of it off.

Service was quick.  I will definitely be back.","GL B&amp;G is our local watering hole.  A no frills spot with a good selection of beer, wine, and liquor.  We&apos;ve been here mostly for happy hour, it&apos;s from 3-6 and 9-close.  There are food and drink specials ($1 off draft beer, wine, cocktail specials, etc...)  The actual bar area is small, but during warm weather there is outside seating, which is great for people watching...on a hot day with a cold brewksi...yup!

Now for the HH food, it is typical bar food.  But I love the crispy curried cauliflower!  It sounds so healthy and it&apos;s tasty, too!  I&apos;ve also indulged in the chicken wings, burger, kalua pork slider, nachos (it&apos;s a huge portion), hummus, caesar salad, and habanero mac and cheese.  And that&apos;s not all of the food offerings, either!  Their eats really just hit the spot when all you want to do is grab a bite.

We&apos;ve also been by for dinner and have had some of the dinner portions of the HH food.  And we&apos;ve also had the apple grilled pork loin, prime dip, BAMB burger, among other entrees.  They also have dinner specials which are worth taking a glance at. 

I&apos;ve already talked about the drink offerings, but another reason we come here is because of the bartenders!  They&apos;re really cool!  And I&apos;ve yet to be disappointed by their recommendations for cocktails and drinks (particularly whiskey)!  Thanks, Joe!  I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll be coming by this week soon! :)","Tried lucky&apos;s for the first time today and it was a 5 star experience all around!! Can&apos;t wait to go back :)

Food:
Tofu banh mi - one of the most delicious sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had (and I don&apos;t say this lightly). The tofu was so flavorful and juicy, the pickled vegetables added amazing crunch and fresh flavor, and the pesto and sauces were perfect and added even more moisture/creaminess. But even with all that moisture the bread was not soggy at all: crunchy outside without hurting your mouth and soft fluffy inside

Spicy chicken banh mi - my friend ordered this and said it was amazing; he loved the sauce on it

Service: 
The lady at the cashier is one of the sweetest people I&apos;ve ever met and was so accommodating. She was so kind and patient, please tip kindly if you can!

Covid precautions: 
The inside of the shop is so pretty and clean; they have one way aisles set up so it feels very covid safe!","Lucky&apos;s has become one of my favorite spots to pick up a quick lunch! I always get their Pork Banh Mi - It&apos;s honestly one of the best banh mi&apos;s I&apos;ve ever had, the pork is so tender and soft and the pickled vegetables and the bread are great. Their chicken pho is also fantastic! The employees at the store are always extremely kind and welcoming, and the service is really fast and efficient. Can&apos;t recommend it more!","Lucky&apos;s Pho is by far my favorite in the area!! I usually get the veggie pho with beef broth and they give you SO many veggies it&apos;s amazing. It&apos;s super clean and cute in there so once covid is over its the perfect atmosphere. Take out is just as delicious, my go to every time!","EDIT:  Well I just gave it a second shot, and I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately I got the same result: more chunks of pure fat in my pork sandwich (see photos).  I also tried the spring rolls and the shrimp smelled a little fishy...I felt ok about eating eat, but that&apos;s not a great indicator of freshness.  I really have no choice but to lower my rating, and I&apos;m on the fence between 2 and 3 stars :/  As I said in my original review below, I liked pretty much everything else about the sandwich, but if they can&apos;t be bothered to check their meat and remove giant hunks of fat before serving it, I can&apos;t be bothered to give them my business.



I just found a new lunch spot near work and I&apos;m pretty darn pleased about it!  Ordered takeout from Lucky&apos;s for the first time today because I was craving a bahn mi, and they popped up as the most promising option.  

I ordered the pork sandwich and was not let down.  The baguette is a crucial part of any successful bahn mi, and this one was excellent with just the right amount of toasty crunchiness and good flavor.  The fillings were well-balanced, and there didn&apos;t seem to be too much or too little of anything.  The standard cast of carrots, cucumber, daikon, cilantro and jalape√±o were present, along with a really tasty chimichurri sauce.  I always order a side of extra jalape√±os with my bahn mi, and I forgot to do that, but was pleasantly surprised that there were enough to get me by and provide a nice little kick.  They also added lettuce, which I found a bit strange and definitely unnecessary.  

My one complaint with my meal is with the pork.  The cubed morsels of meat were quite tasty, but about halfway through I got an unpleasant chunk of fat and had to spit it out.  At the end, I got another one :/  Now I don&apos;t mind some soft fat on the meat in my sandwiches, but these pieces were PURE fat...not gristly, but still definitely not something I want to eat.

Because of how good the sandwich was otherwise, I&apos;m giving them the benefit of the doubt that this isn&apos;t the norm, and will definitely be back again.  Although if get more fat chunks on the second sandwich, a third visit will probably be unlikely.","I have eaten at Luckys 50+ times. There are two reasons I go there and not any of the other pho places around. 

1) The food is excellent. Every meal that I have had at Luckys has been delicious, filling, and cost-effective. I have tried most of their phos and bahn mis, but these days I get the chicken pho with veggie broth every time. The noodles are always the perfect texture, the broth is always the perfect flavor, and the chicken is always cooked to perfection. 

 
2)  The owners and staff are incredibly friendly. The owners are a husband and wife that cook and work the register respectively. After my first few times, they both knew who I was and started welcoming me every time I came in. They&apos;re always incredibly happy and upbeat. The rest of the staff follows suit, and they are all great people. 

I recommend Luckys to everyone, and I think anyone who reads this should make Luckys their go-to pho place.","A neighborhood staple! Always an excellent, consistent experience. Food is delicious and inexpensive for the neighborhood. Wait times for food have always been reasonable. 

My usual order is a pork banh mi with shrimp spring rolls. The pork is incredibly tender and delicious. I&apos;ve had plenty of dry banh mi, but never here. Always plenty of meat. Very crumbly bread, the only negative is that it occasionally tastes like it&apos;s either slightly stale or has been frozen. 

Spring rolls are delicious, as is the peanut sauce I dowse them in. 

Service has never been anything short of phenomenal- always friendly and upbeat. I feel good patronizing this spot.",Would highly recommend! The staff there were so friendly and kind. I ordered the beef pho and boba milk tea. It was really delicious and satisfied my craving for Vietnamese food.,"Review for...
| Chin Bo Vein | Pho with meatballs and beef with truffle oil | 

Thank you lucky&apos;s pho for giving me a divine experience I didn&apos;t know I needed. My tummy is full. My house smells like truffle oil and I have reached a new level of satisfaction. The meatballs were tender and delicious. The noodles were of high quality with the perfect amount of buoyancy and consistency. The broth. ...The broth. Savory, sweet and so much more. It reached the depths of my soul, and I am proud to announce that I am now a cat that has reached enlightenment.",Best pho in Fremont. Their chicken is so tender and i would drink their broth out of a cup!,"Love Lucky&apos;s!! Delicious pho, friendly staff, and an impressively stocked bathroom. Never change, Lucky&apos;s.","First: 4 stars for me is a very good review. 

Second, this review is based on two separate visits ordering b√°nh m√¨ sandwiches.  

In short, they are very good.  I ordered the pork bahn mi sandwich and there was a great deal of pork on the sandwich they did not skimp. There was also lots of flavor meaning sauce and seasoning. 

Sure, it&apos;s a little bit more than your bahn mi sandwich in places in Little Saigon over by Jackson Street. And both are worth it, but this sandwich is very special and I highly recommend it. 

Finally the service was very good pleasant and courteous. 

I highly recommend this place in Fremont","I like Lucky&apos;s pho for a various reasons. I like the clean, simple atmosphere. I love that they allow you get your own toppings, giving you the freedom to dump all the jalape√±os and sweat your way out. I also think their Ban Mi is pretty good. They got an interesting sauce on it that makes it taste fresh. I also love that their bread doesn&apos;t tear up the top of your mouth.
The pho is decent too. I did think the regular looked rather small, so go with a large.","Sorry friendly service! I usually stop in to grab something to go in my transfer to school. They are usually very quick and the fresh tools are tasty! I&apos;ll have to stop in for the pho some day. 

They also recently did some renovations and spruced up the space a bit. I&apos;ll be back again soon! Thanks!",The best Pho we&apos;ve had in Seattle! Their staff is SO kind and friendly and their food is excellent!! The cutest spot to enjoy pho and bubble tea!!,This is the first pho place I ever went  where you walk to the front and order &amp; you grab your own condiments. UNLIMITED. The menu is very minimal which is great cause that means I can make a fraction quickly. Their broth is much darker and thicker. Lots of fat to make it rich. The service is more like self service but the staff were very kind. I love how they listed common allergy/ dietary restrictions on their sauces so we the customers don&apos;t have to constantly go up and ask whats inside the sauces,"I highly recommend this restaurant. The staff was so friendly and the food was delicious, well seasoned, and affordable. I was feeling extra hungry so I ordered the spicy chicken bahn mi, shrimp spring rolls, and beef pho. Everything I ate was fantastic!","It&apos;s open later than nearby pho options so I stumbled in one day, 27 minutes before closing. I guess they only do take out 30 minutes before closing (fair enough). I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s fair to judge take-out pho, as I like it to be piping hot. We microwaved it at home, still pretty decent. I got the tendon pho. 

Not my favorite pho in the world, but I may be back as it&apos;s close and easy to get to from where I am, just across the fremont Bridge, also right by the 62 bus stop.

The service was also very friendly and the decor is neat and minimalist.

They also have boba, which I will probably try and update.","We used to live in the building behind Lucky&apos;s and ate there almost every night! The banh mi sandwiches might just be my favorite in Seattle (that&apos;s saying a lot!). Super friendly, welcoming staff. Very quick takeout orders. We love it!","Friendly staff that take time to give you a recommendation of boba options. 

The restaurant is clean. They also have a sense of humor which I like (see photo). 

I only had time to order the MilkTea Boba here. The boba was as fresh as can be; chewy and soft, just right! The tea was freshly made and they substituted my drink with almond milk, which I love.

I would definitely go back to try their pho and vermicelli for sure. 

Boba 5/5 stars 
Cleanliness 5/5 
Friendliness 5/5","Amazing food and the kindest staff! They always remember me and are so gracious. Delicious pho with high quality ingredients, and really great boba tea.","I come here alllll the time. I live close by and I know I always enjoy their food and drinks. When I was still at UW, I enjoyed coming here for casual nights out and the mojito pitchers during the summer. Now, I come for a good view and some tasty bites. Blistered shishito peppers have really been on my restaurant lists lately and the dipping sauce they make is mouth watering. Oh my stars. 
I do miss their old Brussels sprouts that had goat cheese and balsamic, now they&apos;re just oily and topped with some shredded parm.
The pulled pork sandwich is a favorite go to of mine and I usually oscillate between getting a side Caesar salad or some crispy fries. The staff have been consistently pleasant and I&apos;ve gotten to chat with a couple of their leads before. I appreciate how they interact with the Greenlake community and I&apos;m a large fan of their dress code allowing for some really dope outfits and expression. I&apos;ll be coming back here over and over.","This place continues to somehow get worse, no matter how many chances I give it. 
But finally, I am done - the last visit will remain just that: my last visit. 

It&apos;s really too bad - there are many guests, including myself, who have tried to help better this establishement with honest reviews about specific changes that needed to be addressed. It doesn&apos;t seem they were. 

I called in last week and placed a pick up order of the kale Cesar with chicken, my regular order. I asked for no dressing (sub olive oil) or croutons, extra parm.  I know this salad inside and out and what I received wasn&apos;t kale or Caesar leaves. It was, however, dry and disgusting. There was no usual lemon or parm that comes on the salad, let alone the extra parm I requested when ordering. 

My quoted wait time was 10 minutes but it took 20. When I got home, I was shocked that it took double the time for less than half of the regular ingredients. The same salad also increased in price by at least $2 since the new menu rolled out. The salad is served with less ingredients but costs more now? Anyway, the salad attached was $18. I&apos;ll let you be the judge. I tossed it immediately and said goodbye to shelter. Postmates makes it too easy to get what you actually want to eat when neighborhood spots continuously let you down.","This place was very &quot;trendy&quot;.   It&apos;s open, clean, and has a variety of food.  It is also family friendly. 

I gave it only four stars for the following reasons. 

First, our server might have been in a bad mood or his day was not going very well.  Although he was attentive and was helpful when we asked him questions on the menu. Their was something missing.  He was &quot;just doing his job&quot; I suppose but he didn&apos;t have a good personality for the industry.  I hope he was just not in a good mood for the day????  The other servers seemed to be laughing and having a good time.  

Second, I ordered the fish tacos which looked and tasted great!  (See picture) But the hard shelled tacos instantly broke with the first bite.  I had to break them all up and turn them into a salad.  

I love the location that is just across the street from beautiful Green Lake.  We may be back and give it another try.","The Shelter

The best thing about this place is the openness and all the natural light that comes in, also has an amazing view of the lake. It has plenty of different seating options, bar, table, booths and lounge type. 

One downside it is a bit loud but if you sit away from the openness in the back bar the volume comes down a lot.

It has a decent beer, wine, and cocktail selection. Majority of their food has the typical bar flavor with a little spin.  I love their street corn appetizer, we also ordered the burger and fish and chips last time we went. It was as expected for bar food. The fish was similar to fish sticks, but the fries are the good type of bar fries that you every once in a while have urges for.

Service bordered on the so casual you might as well cook. 
The blistered peppers looked like and were presented like farm animal food. Poor quality and not classically sized. 
The deviled eggs swam in some &quot;wet&quot; and were chalky as all get out. 
The fries....still good. The burger is serviceable, but the size of the bun vs the meat makes it kind of jokey now. I don&apos;t know why they made that change. 
Cocktails were uninspiring. It was a slow lunch so no excuses on a busy beat. 
5 other visits have just kept going downhill until this last stop. 
Great location. I wish it would recover.","The wonton tacos came in a set of 4, I got mine with pork belly(I think that&apos;s the default). The meat was incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned. These tacos are surprisingly delicious! I think that&apos;s the first time where I go like omgoodness with tacos. I would definitely come back here very often.","I am updating my review from 1 to 3 stars due to the fact that the overcharge in tip may have been the result of speedy fingers/human error. 

After I left the review, the bar manager reached out to rectify the situation. I appreciate that he was proactive in addressing my concerns, provided me with an in-depth response, and just overall the level of customer service in trying to make a negative customer experience into a positive one.","Loved the location and the seating. The food was also very good. This is a great place to bring out of town guests. You can spend some time in Green lake and the grab brunch or lunch here. The drinks are good too.

The only drawbacks are that it is crowded and may be hard to find seating and the servers were a bit arrogant acting, didn&apos;t like that.","This place is so cute! I came in around 2 PM on a Saturday and brunch was still going. I figured they would have switched to the dinner menu by then. Open seating in the restaurant and tons of windows to let in lots of natural light. Walking distance from the Greenlake Community Center so a good place to go to after playing some pickle ball! 

The cinnamon roll was giant with rich cream cheese frosting. The brussel sprouts were a little on the greasy side but were nice and crispy.","We walked in this restaurant after an event an Greenlake. There was a small wait, but no big deal. The inside is really pretty, open, and bright. I&apos;m going to break this review down into food and service-which is how I got the 3 star rating. 

Food: 4/5, the food was above average, and I might be convinced to try it again. We had the wings, the Brussels sprouts, and the house made sausage. All were pretty good. 

Service: 2/5, here&apos;s where it just really goes downhill. The server came to our table a total 5 times: to give us water (she didn&apos;t welcome us or say hello) to take our order, to drop off our food, to drop of the check, and to bring back the check. We tried to get her attention and different times, and she either ignored us or said hold on and passed our table multiple times before she came back. I don&apos;t think she even spoke 5 words to us. It wasn&apos;t a pleasant dining experience. 

The atmosphere is also extremely loud for a Sunday morning. 

With better service and a quieter atmosphere, we might return.","Decent bar quality breakfast food. Simple menu. Service is meh. 

We came here on a Sunday and was seated right away. It was actually not that busy inside the dining room and didn&apos;t even fill up while we were there. Our waitress was there but she wasn&apos;t particularly attentive or friendly. When we first sat down, she filled our water glass and then walked away. Didn&apos;t even ask if we wanted coffee or a drink. 

The menu is very simple. They have a couple of breakfast items and some lunch items. I saw people ordering both at breakfast. Their salads seems to be popular, the portions are humongous. 

We ordered the shelter sando and the shelter benedict. The portions are pretty big and larger than what I expected. They served potatoes as sides and these were surprisingly good. They were wedges but crispy and flavorful without being salty. The sando I got reminded me of grilled cheese. It was SO buttery and good. I was only planning on eating half but ended up eating the whole thing. The wait time for food was also short. I was barely into my mimosa before the food came out. Also, random but their OJ in the mimosa has pulp in it.","I used to love coming to the GL shelter.  The service was always spotty, but the drink and food and vibe was great!  There aren&apos;t a ton of fun well rounded spots on GL, so Shelter can get away with some things not being 5 star, like the service.  

I just went in and to my disappointment they had changed the menus.  Not for the better, from what I experienced .  Even the kids menu isn&apos;t as good. 
My green salad was just lettuce and too much dressing, nothing else. 
My child&apos;s Burger was chewey and hard to eat. The Dino nuggets were over cooked, but really Dino nuggets?
From what I can tell by the menu, seeing other people&apos;s food and my food - they are trying to compete with the lunchbox or something. The portions were massive (usually not a bad thing), but just not quite as unique of a menu. 

I overheard a lot of people commenting on how they missed the old menu.  New is nice, but somehow all the favorites were pulled and now I have service and a less appealing food and drink menu against me choosing Shelter every week.",Love coming here for brunch. The open space and windows make for great natural lighting and the food portions are pretty big! Perfect place to eat after a run around greenlake,"Would give 3 1/2 stars if an option. (Come on Yelp give us this option)

Went here for happy hour the first time with a friend who has been many times. We each got the Kale Caesar salad &amp; split an &quot;avocado fries&quot; appetizer. I did not care so much for the salad. Too much kale &amp; not enough romaine in it for me. Dressing a little bland. The avocado fries however were awesome. Sliced, battered &amp; fried avocado served with a yummy sauce. However they were served on top of the sauce &amp; I would prefer a ramekin of sauce on the side. 

Drinks were very good. Their house tequila &amp; whiskey were both good and their house cola was good too. 

I was shocked to see so many children here. I would not consider this a place to take kids.",Excellent! My husband said the pulled pork sandwich was the best he has never tasted before anywhere else!  Loss of one star since the zucchini &quot;frites&quot; with my Jamaican Jerk Chicken were actually grilled strips  (not what I was expecting). The pulled pork tacos my daughter and I shared were amazing. The view of the lake is spectacular and the open space of the restaurant beautifully done. Nice job Shelter!,"The natural lighting is probably the most attractive feature of Shelter. Food is good, drinks are good, service is good, etc. I got the vibe that the menu is pretty &quot;set&quot; so if you are someone who needs quite a few substitutions, maybe phone first. For example, I asked for the breaded tacos to be grilled and that was unfortunately not an option. The atmosphere is great if you are looking for something more modern. When I have been in, there is more of a young adult crowd. They have some fun seating toward the green lake-side of the restaurant, making it fun for a party of three or four to lounge and enjoy your company.","I&apos;ve been to this shelter and the one in Ballard a few times! We came here after an afternoon paddle boarding on greenlake (would also recommend). It just so happened to be happy hour (which is daily from 4-6 pm) so I got a glass of white wine for $5! It was perfect, since it was so warm out that day! 

I ordered the heirloom tomatoes and burrata, because I wanted something light and tasty. Let me tell ya, it was perfect! The tomatoes were sweet and the cheese was nice and creamy! I would definitely recommend this app if you&apos;re looking for a light snack. I&apos;ve been to this place a handful of times, and haven&apos;t always had the best experiences, so keep that in mind. My experience this last time was good!","Stopped by Shelter on a beautiful afternoon for happy hour drinks and apps and it was perfect. This place is HUGE and very nicely decorated with a ton of open air seating since the windows roll up. Plus, you simply cannot get a better view of Greenlake on a sunny Seattle day!

Service was friendly, food came out fast, and the drinks were all delicious. I&apos;ve read other Yelpers have had bad brunch experiences here but for a mid-week happy hour this place is a solid choice.","I&apos;m so sad about writing this review because Shelter has always been a favorite of mine and my husband. We live in the area and would definitely say we come to Shelter more often than not, but recently I went with some friends of mine and to my surprise they completely changed their menu. Which I am so sad about! And with what seems like no warning (I was there the week before and there was certainly no warning). 

My friends and I were all sad, but decided to try it out. I had the burger, which wasn&apos;t horrible but the old one was definitely better. One of my friends had the burrata, which was beautifully plated I will say. But way fancier than what we&apos;re used to. She said it was alright. And my other friend got the baby kale salad. I was interested in that also, with the old menu you were allowed to sub the kale for romaine so I asked if that would be possible and the server told us that is not something they will accommodate anymore. However, when her salad came out it was almost entirely romaine. We were very confused. 

Anyways, I&apos;m writing this in hopes that the menu will change. I, along with many others, miss so many of the old items. I&apos;ll be dreaming of those wonton tacos until they return!! Lol","I came here in a group of 3 on a Sunday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised with the happy hour. We had just spent an hour outside at green lake and were super parched and needed a little pick me up. Shelter was a great option. We got pina coladas, house white wine, chips and guac, the pork belly, and the burrata and greens. Everything was great, light and not heavy and more or less affordable. Service was good as wel","I wouldn&apos;t go inside at night. I&apos;ve driven through many times and had some questionable people approach my car.

The food, service, and everything else is fine. They&apos;re open late and have every snack you could want. And for that... I will always love them.",I think the picture says it all.  This was supposed to be a Chicken Cluck sandwich.  Small spot of sauce in the middle.  1 regular and 2 small pickles...in the middle.  Dried out chicken to go with no moisture on the bun = garbage.  District manager &apos;Elvis&apos; could care less as his generic emailed  response to my complaint shows he never even read it.  He did offer a free meal but why would I want another bag of garbage.  Pars Group LLC runs Jack in cities between Seattle and Kent and I have had problems with either the food or customer service in most of them.  Just avoid all Jack in the Box locations and you will have a better chance of receiving quality food.,"Don&apos;t order through door dash. Every single order was messed up.  I tried them a number of different times and the order was always missing something.  Never had a problem with drive through.

I think they are messing up door dash orders on purpose for some reason. Otherwise they would have gotten one order right by accident.","I know it&apos;s fast food, but this JITB is in bad condition, even for low standards. I pull up and there is a homeless woman pooping behind a bush near the drive through. Aurora is always classy! I get in line and order chicken strips and fries. There is only one car in front of me, but that order takes about 5 minutes. Maybe he had a big order? Surely my small order will be ready when I I get to the window! Nope. It&apos;s my turn at the window and I am told the food is still being prepared. Ok whatever, maybe they are just extra careful to make sure you are getting the top notch JITB experience. 

Another 5 minutes later and my chicken and fries are finally handed over. I excitedly pull over and chomp on some fries. Nope again. Fries tasted like old stale cardboard with grease. The fry was also hard, which is not the texture you expect! I literally spit out the one fry I had and lost my appetite for fries. To get the bad taste of stale fries out of my mouth I bit into one of my chicken strips. That was a mistake. It was boiling hot and literally exploded grease right into my mouth and scorched my tongue. 

With no tastebuds left, and defeat in the air, I decided to try my luck at Taco Bell Instead.","I was stuck at the hairdressers for longer than anticipated due to a little mishap with the coloring (I asked for cherry cola color--but she gave me AUBURN), so I didn&apos;t have any time to cook something for my hubby, and I offered to go to Jack In The Box. 

Our problems started looking over the drive thru menu. It was confusing to read. My husband was Frustrated because he couldn&apos;t figure out what he wanted. So we decided to take the opinion of the employee to figure out what he wanted. The employee just said &quot;I don&apos;t know, what do you feel like?&quot;. This naturally left my husband BEYOND FRUSTRATED because he wouldn&apos;t have asked if he didn&apos;t know what he felt like!!! And then I asked what kind of options there were for people with thyroid problems. Then the employee said he didn&apos;t know. 

Who hires such CORN COBS????? Does this company even care to educate their employees on dietary needs?!?? At this point we were super angry. So we lost our apprentices and only wanted two meals each(and a 20 pc nuggets to share of course) 

We were so shaken from this awful experience that we didn&apos;t feel like watching the new episode of our favorite show when we got back home, 90 day fians√® (my husband loves Paul, I&apos;m more of a Darcy fan myself!) 

I hope the next time we&apos;re here there will be someone who&apos;s more understanding of my thyroid problem and knows what&apos;s the hot item here. Get your act straight, Jack!!","Wow, do not go here. I walked up and there was food all over the ground outside. I walked in and there was trash on the floor inside too. There was no one inside and it took a few minutes to get greeted, the lady kept repeating my order but I couldn&apos;t understand what she was saying, then took almost 10 minutes for a small fry and burger.

The employee packed my food Togo and had to ask for a tray so I could eat it inside. That took a while and once I got the tray I realized every single table was gross and had food product on it. I sat at a dirty table anyway because I was just hungry. 

I wanted to use the bathroom but there was a homeless guy in there from the beginning and others kept going in and out from outside. Then I realized that there was a lock on the door and had to wait to get the attention of employees to open it. The bathroom was gross, toilet paper all over the floor, the mirror was broke off, and smelled.

By the time I started eating my burger was cold, tasted old, and the fries were stale. There was even a piece of bacon in my burger that I didn&apos;t order and it tasted disgusting as if it wasn&apos;t even bacon or has been sitting there for all day.

This place seems like it&apos;s having severe management and employee issues with all of these things going wrong.",I love jack in the box even though I live in Florida Jack in the box is my favorite fast food restaurant  every time I go on vacation and there&apos;s a jack in the box that&apos;s my top place would totally recommend also PLS PLS open a jack in the box in Florida I always crave this I would recommend to everyone I know to go to Jack in the box their the best even though they can work on the fries it&apos;s way better than McDonald&apos;s Wendy&apos;s and Burger King combined jack in the box I love you open in Florida pls,they offer better pricing than places like mcdonalds. they also have a more diverse type of menu with their asian food and all. they also have often times more affordable deals as well. i especially like their deluxe fish sandwich meal. it&apos;s appetizing and fills me up.,"Not a particularly clean or welcoming restaurant location... but perfectly acceptable when it comes to providing food -- especially given that we were searching for supper upon our arrival in Seattle on Christmas Day, so our options in the nearby area were limited. The straw for my milkshake was frustratingly narrow and cut up my mouth (the beverage was rather difficult to drink, though it was rather delicious). My sandwich was good however: no complaints there!

The dining area was a bit dirty/messy seeming, and it looked like the restaurant had some issues with unruly customers in the past as they had very restrictive bathroom policies for example, but overall our visit wasn&apos;t bad, just a bit unsettling and the difficulty in getting good plastic utensils and napkins to go with our meal was a bit frustrating.","The service at this jacking the box is highly inaccurate, and extremely slow. When I have a 20min layover for the D-line and try to get simply just a coffee, I still miss my bus. When nobody is in line in front of me. 

They put their emphasis of service in the drive thru, or so I thought until today. I ordered a sausage biscuit combo with a coffee, one of the most generic basic things to order. They gave me bacon instead of sausage, even after ordering twice at the speaker box, then again at the window where I expected to pay. I should&apos;ve checked my sandwich before driving away, however there were people behind me waiting to get there food because somehow my order took so long. I ordered multiple times, at the speaker box and personally at the window and they still got my order wrong. 

I also think it&apos;s ridiculous that they don&apos;t put cream and sugar in your coffee for you when your obviously driving, when in the drive thru. 

Another complaint I have is that they open their door late most mornings, sometimes 10mins after the intentional opening time, even though their drive thru is open. Very unorganized, inaccurate, and often a big waste of time to try to go. I wish it wasn&apos;t the most convenient fast food spot for me to go to. It&apos;s treat for me to go, when I do go, so it sucks that there&apos;s always a problem whenever I try to go.","This place is gross. As I walked in no one greeted me, the two employees were just chatting away for 3 minutes. As I was about to leave they finally noticed me. My order was a jumbo jack with cheese and shredded lettuce, what I got was a fingerprinted burger, tasted okay I guess. 
The worst part of my experience was the bathrooms, gross pee and poop on the floor, cigarette buts and wet door handle. I will never be back here.","Wow. Just stopped here for fries and an egg roll on the way to a friends house. When I got to the drive thru, there was a car in front of me and the driver was screaming at the person in the window. Before long, they&apos;re both screaming curse words at each other. The driver takes off and I pull up. It&apos;s the manager (at least I think she was, since she had a different shirt on than everyone else) that was yelling at the customer. I hear her calling her a crackhead and that she needs to go f*ck herself. 

As for me, my order never got entered, so she tells me that she doesn&apos;t have anything on the screen. Ok, fine. I tell her what I ordered. She takes my money and throws a bag at me, while she&apos;s still telling other people how pissed she is. I say thank you and she doesn&apos;t even look at me. 

Check my order and I&apos;ve got fries and a potato cake. No egg roll. So I park, go inside and tell the person at the counter that my order is wrong. She takes the potato cake out of my bag and PUTS IT BACK UNDER THE HEAT LAMP. Seriously? What if I had licked it or something? Not that I did, but still. Then she puts an egg roll in the bag and tosses it across the counter. 

If I could give this place zero stars, I would. Oh, and when I went back to my car, the manager was outside on her cell phone telling someone else that they needed to f*ck off. OMG.","Good Lord, what is wrong with this place? I usually go to the drive-through because the dining room is filled with drug dealers, but the service time is uniformly awful and they have a 100% success rate of messing up my order.","If i could give it zero stars i would. Since my mom works near there we stopped at the drive through a few times at 9 pm. Both times for 2 meals we waited over 25 minutes. One time there was 1 car ahead of us who got 1 bag and the other tine 2 cars were ahead of us with 1 bag each. Maybe 1 person does everything there because fast food, well, should be fast . I could have ate at red robin and been done and paid about the same amount. Remember those 1 min 30 sec. Timers at the window. You need those and higher expectations. I get that minimum wage sucks but if thats the job you chose, do it. Hurry up while your at it please. No other jnb is like this one so its sad we have to miss out due to the time it takes to get the &quot;fast &quot; food. #makefastfoodfastagain","Very slow service. Several minutes with the window down waiting for them even to take my order, in the pouring rain.   No napkins. No conversation.","Don&apos;t usually write reviews but I made an exception on this one occasion. While ordering food I asked for a cup of water the guy at the drive thru said okay.... as soon as a pulled up he forgot my order including my order. He also forgot my water when he gave me order, this person didn&apos;t bother looking at what&apos;s in the cup it looked like they got the water from Flint Michigan water crisis. And I was the only person in line but he made it like he was so busy running around not knowing what to do... oh well this the jack in the box on aurora","I&apos;ve seen some pretty gross fast food places before, and this has to be in the top 2. I came in to grab a soda, snack, and to use the restroom while I was waiting for my bus...big mistake. For some reason half the restaurant and the entire bathroom floor was coated in a slippery, nasty slime. My boots, which are made for hiking, were slipping and sliding like it had been greased in lard. The bathroom itself had water and blood--and a half-eaten burger--all over the floor. I was too afraid to order food or drink my soda after seeing all this so I just paid and left without drinking it. Big wtf.","I literally have NEVER had a more abrupt or rushed service at a drive thru menu as we pulled up I asked about a menu item and she explained quickly then was like OK (like she added it to the order even though I&apos;d only asked about it) when I ordered a chicken sandwich. She quickly asked if I wanted a convo I though for a sec and before I could respond &quot;DO YOU WANT A COMBO&quot; before I could think she&apos;d reappeared herself about 3 times! Then when I got up to the window she didn&apos;t even remember what I had ordered?! The GROSSEST part I saw TWO RATS just in the short time we sat in the drive thru, on the way there I kid you not the police were covering a body up in the street... Generally just not a nice neighborhood","After a long day, i went to the drive thru at 2 am. i was politely ordering my food and his African American male employee was giving me attitude. Treated me like shit. i question my return here in future. No Customer Service skills what so ever.  Never had a problem before and the food is good. 
If a manager is reading this, please have a talk with this employee.",Can whoever the manager that runs and trains these people make up their mind on what their policy is on the mail in Jack in Box offers? I&apos;ve gone 4x and everytime they tell me something different. Poor management and poor training.,"I have had this place on my list for a decade now..i&apos;ll admit it was only because they are one of the only places in town that serve toasted raviolis. I finally ordered takeout from them last week and was pleased with the food. The helping of toasted ravioli was enough to satiate my years long craving for them. My only complaint was there wasn&apos;t enough marinara to dunk all the ravioli. Maybe I did that wrong and should have poured the sauce over the pasta..but I enjoy toasted ravioli as finger food. Anyway, I digress! I would order these over and over again - they were everything I could have hoped for. You know what they say, &quot;distance makes the heart grow fonder&quot;- definitely the case for me and toasted ravioli. 

And then there was a greek pizza. This was pretty standard, albeit a bit pricey for all cheese and veggies. I probably would skip this next time and just double up on the toasted ravioli. Did I mention you should probably have the toasted ravioli?","If we could give this place negative stars, I promise you we would. The customer service here is nonexistent. The woman who we spoke with was curt, aggressive and overtly unpleasant. It was as if she felt it was her job to alienate customers... and we had tipped her.

I would write a review about the food we paid for.. but we simply abandoned it. That is how absolutely impressive this experience was for us. We didn&apos;t even want to eat the pizza we paid for... the positive reviews are either for a different location or are fluke occurrences. 

Suffice it to say.. we refuse to be treated like this by anyone. 

Eat at this location at your on peril. We won&apos;t be going anywhere near this place and their unsanitary, careless and demoralizing staff.

I would say more but I just can&apos;t bring myself to waste anymore time, energy or money on these people. A little bit of kindness goes a long way in a pandemic. It&apos;s the negative interactions that will stick with us forever.","The reviews of this place aren&apos;t very good. I really like this place. it&apos;s pretty small with a bar and an area for seating. I&apos;ve been 3 times now. Usually it&apos;s steady busy but you can always fine a place to sit.

The thing I really like about this place is the chicken wings. In general I hate wings, but for some reason I love these. They have taste and aren&apos;t extremely greasy. You can get an order for $9 which I usually share. 

The pizza is fine. Not the best, which they should work on a bit since it is in there name.

Drinks are good and not too expensive.

One complaint might be that since they usually have only one bartender at a usually crowded bar it can take a moment to get the bartenders&apos; attention because they are so busy.

This bar has a more adult vibe. You will see what looks like college-aged students at tables having food and drinks with friends but there are a lot of people in there 40s and 50s. It&apos;s not too loud and crazy but it&apos;s a fun place to chill and have a drink and chicken wings with Friends.","I live right next door and the employees ALWAYS stand right outside smoking cigarettes, with no mask on, during a pandemic, blocking the whole sidewalk and making everything reek like cigarettes, being rude to locals. Plus the pizza and service at the restaurant is bad.","I love eating here! The pizza is tasty and seems well made for being so inexpensive. The small 2 topping pizza for $9 is unbeatable and shareable between 2 light eaters. For less than $20, my gf and I get the small to share and a pint of the day a piece. The vibe is right - chill red lighting and some pop art. The last couple times, I&apos;ve had the same bartender and he&apos;s quite polite and accommodating! Recommend for a cheap date, catching up with friends or chowing down solo.","Check your order before they walk away because these thieves will charge you for items you never received and will keep your money. 

I have ordered from this restaurant through Grub Hub many times and they consistently forget items in my order. Usually it&apos;s the sodas. If I order 2 sodas I receive one. If I order 3 sodas I receive one. 

I&apos;m pretty patient and forgiving but this was becoming a regular thing. So the last time it happened I called the restaurant immediately and asked for a refund for the items not received. They apologized and agreed but never did it. 

I called GrubHub to complain and they called the restaurant. The restaurant refused to give me a refund. They&apos;re just going to keep my money I guess. GrubHub was kind enough to offer a refund themselves and said they&apos;d keep a watch on the restaurant.",Perfect late-night snack for a great price and very convenient.  The pesto cheese sticks are oh so gooey and oh so good.  Mix that with their hot pressed sandwiches.  Feeds many and leaves all satisfied.  I&apos;ve found a secret gem hidden on The Ave and I will be coming back quite often.,"DO NOT ORDER FOOD HERE.. The lady preparing the food has horrible hygiene complete with dirt under her fingernails. No gloves either. I went to pick up my order and she was passed out, no shoes with her gross feet kicked up on a chair in the kitchen. I threw the food away and went to subway.","Pizza is unremarkable, the employees are rude as hell. They are always standing right in front of the building (if not the entrance to apartment buildings!!!) smoking cigarettes, masks off, blocking the sidewalk. It&apos;s beyond rude and unfair to people just trying to walk by or access their building. I&apos;ve worked in the service 10 years and smoke. You can go out back, just like every other restaurant employee does, y&apos;all ain&apos;t special. Unfortunate they care so little about their neighbors who are immune compromised or disabled (or just any of us, honestly).0/10 SUCKY employees.","Wow unimpressed,pizza tastes like a bad dominoes pizza,crust sucks,nothing special about it whatsoever,probably should have gotten a frozen pizza and saved 20 bucks.The wings,alot of skin,no fried outside,fatty,nothing special about the wings either.wont be going here again.good is shit!","Ordered the Pesto Sauce pizza late at night (well done). The pizza was cooked to PERFECTION! Cheese to sauce proportion was A+. The pesto sauce was flavorful and full bodied, but not overwhelming like pesto can sometimes be. Would order again!","I&apos;m really impressed. The bartender was extremely friendly and engaging. You just can&apos;t teach the class this guy had. He also had a great presence about him and a voice good for radio or voice over. 

I had the Godfather calzone, and it was fantastic. Seasoning was great and so was the breading. Food came out hot and quick. My only real complaint was the marinara was fridge cold but, I&apos;m willing to say it was a minor mistake. Over all, good food at reasonable price. I will be going back to this place for sure! They sure had anything you wanted to drink.",I called in about a question for my to go order and the woman on the phone was incredibly rude and unhelpful. I will definitely be giving my business elsewhere.,"I&apos;ve only got pizza from here on postmates, but I really like this place! They are consistently good &amp; open late, what more could you want !","Weak drinks, slow and rude service, no cell phone reception. We went inside to escape the cold and the place was just as cold as outside.","I ordered a slice of veggie pizza which was essentially, served at room temperature, meaning it was cold. And hence, it was more like eating a slice of any other cold pizza. 
So, obviously, you do not want to come here for pizza after 9pm.
However, the joint has a few tv screens, games and music for entertainment and of course, it is a great hang out for drinkers.","These guys are really operating on top of their game. Running a good bar &amp; dishing out quality food at the same time. One of the best pizza spots in town.

Always active, their staff knows what needs to be done and they Do it. To the customer, that translates into an overall good experience.","After 3 hours (2+ hours past the expected delivery time) our 1 pizza + 1 soda was never delivered. By this time, we were running so late I called to cancel, but they could not issue a refund &apos;due to policy&apos;. After talking with a manager they agreed to a refund. That refund never showed up. I called back 2 weeks later. Again, they agreed to refund, and again that refund never came through. 

Shady people.","Cool digs...food MEH

Came in here after exploring the farmers market looking for a quick bite to eat. Luckily they have $3 slices and a full bar with decent beers on tap. 
I ordered a veggie slice and it was just so-so. Would probably fare better by ordering a &quot;fresh&quot; pizza or perhaps one of their other array of menu items. It was just lacking flavor and who knows how long it&apos;s been sitting out. 

I enjoyed the atmosphere...a little divey and a Metallica pin ball machine. Nice. 
Service can tend to be a bit slow. 
Happy hour starts at 2PM which is awesome and they have specials every day of the week. Worth another shot - they have 1/2 off pizzas on Sundays I believe!",Pizza sucked.   Waited 1 hour and got burnt pizza. Cheese was burned and crust was soggy,"Having just finished up a fun visit to the Water Lantern Festival at Green Lake, #seattledude and I were hungry and feeling underwhelmed by the food truck options at the festival. (Plus, there was no beer!) So we hopped on Yelp and found the 74th Street Ale House just up the hill in Phinney Ridge. It was pretty crowded on a Saturday evening, but we found a table in the back and quickly ordered a couple of pints. I had one of my faves, a Mac &apos;n Jacks, which is almost impossible to find on tap closer to home. He had a stout. Good autumn beers for sure!

We also split an oyster po&apos; boy sandwich and a goat cheese salad. They even split them for us, at no extra charge, which was super sweet. The food was fresh and delicious, though I felt the goat cheese portion on the (split) salads were pretty small. The po&apos; boys were tasty, and the oysters were fresh and perfectly fried. It was a good meal to top off a cool fall day in the big city.

The service was great, too - our waitress was friendly and helpful, not to mention patient as we were pretty indecisive about what to order from their extensive menu.",I wouldn&apos;t have expected a neighborhood ale house to have many salad selections but was excited to find a few really good ones here! I was in the neighborhood around dinner and decided to grab a mixed green salad to go. I ordered at the bar and waited only about ten minutes before my order was up. The restaurant was very busy when I was there at 6:30 on a Monday night - a good sign for a small neighborhood restaurant! I will definitely come back for a full meal in the future. The bartender who took my order was super friendly and helpful and I look forward to coming back soon!,"Meh, this was not great.

The positives of this were the staff mostly. They Are professional, and exceptionally attentive and friendly. The space was also nice, clean and homey and was able to accommodate the large group I came with.

But the food was bad. I had a Cesar Salad with blackened chicken. The salad was very skimpy and bland and the chicken was a bit too spicy. 

My friends both had the $17 bowl of pasta and were very disappointed. They said it was bland and greasy and just smothered in cheese, something they wow have expected at a Midwestern diner.

I also ordered the garlic cheese bread and that was the most disappointing thing of all. It&apos;s just shredded white and yellow cheese and microwaved on garlic bread???? Seriously? it was like something I would&apos;ve made for myself at home after coming back from a night of drinking my early 20s. 


The beer selection was also not what we&apos;d have expected from an ale house.","This little pub proves that you don&apos;t need a deep fryer to have great pub food.  I&apos;ve been here something like a bajillion times, but I never wrote a review. 

Always get me a cold beer and curried cashews to start.  Then I decide between the best tuna melt ever or a big salad with soup. Satisfying fare and friendly neighborhood vibe with real regulars are found here. I love this place.

God Bless the 74th Street.","A good little spot to grab a drink in the neighborhood.

Pros?
Tasty garlic bread
Big glasses of wine 
Friendly service 
Lots of seating 
Outdoor seating too
Full bar 

Cons?
Inside smelled a bit odd and we couldn&apos;t place our finger on why","Review from a person with celiac disease:

This is one of my all-time favorite Seattle restaurants and I&apos;m so, so glad that they have a gluten free menu. 

I get their Reuben sandwich every time. It&apos;s the most delicious Reuben I&apos;ve ever had, and from what my friends have told me, the gluten free bread is even better than the regular!

For such a small kitchen, it&apos;s amazing how they can make safe gluten free food. It&apos;s all about cleanliness, I guess!

There&apos;s always a gluten free soup option (these have always been tasty!) and they have cider if you&apos;re avoiding beer. 

I love how cozy it feels inside: the atmosphere is probably my favorite thing after the Reuben. It&apos;s so cozy like an English pub, with signs up and carpeting. It feels like I&apos;m in someone&apos;s house. 

Thank you for the excellent food and special service!!!","Love this place, still crazy after all these years...
Excellent staff, even better food (if that&apos;s possible)
Interesting clientele (that&apos;s good!)","This is going to be the rare case of someone giving a five star review for a place where I didn&apos;t like the featured food, but that&apos;s what&apos;s going to happen.

I came here for a lunch on a nice sunny day in Seattle. I wanted to walk around a bit, and treat myself to a good meal. Hence: finally trying what has been recommended as the best Reuben sandwich in the city. Verdict? It&apos;s not. That honor goes to Market House Meats downtown. In truth, the sandwich wasn&apos;t that great, but I plan on going back and getting their flame-broiled burger to see how I like it. 

(I will say that I think Reubens may be a matter of taste.) 

What was worth my rating? The service. The nice interior. The pesto pasta salad. The fact that my waitress didn&apos;t seem to mind that I&apos;m very shy. I repeat: the pesto pasta salad. I didn&apos;t know what to expect, but they managed to take a very simple concept and make it extraordinary. That is the part of the my meal that was stellar, so if you&apos;re uncertain about what to add with your sandwich, you&apos;ve got the recommendation from right here! 

Anyway - definitely planning on returning. I&apos;ll drink next time. This time, I had a nice iced tea with my meal, and it was fantastic.","This was my first time to this ale house. I feel sure I will not return. I ordered a Cesar salad as my dinner. I assumed I&apos;d get a dinner sized salad. What I got was a tiny plate of lettuce, croutons and a bit of shredded cheese. I would have expected this as a starter plate. When I asked the waitress about the tiny salad she confirmed this was indeed their dinner size. Ridiculous. I ended up ordering another item to make it a meal. I ordered the artichoke hummus pita plate, tiny dish of humus that wasn&apos;t very good, tasteless red pepper slices, some Greek olives and bread. Boo. Terribly disappointing. 
You get one star because the waitress was nice. 
The good news is that there are a zillion other restaurants options in this area. Skip this place.","Try the tuna melt will make you a believer. Great beers tap and the service is the best on Phinney Ridge, always the best :)","Neighborhood joint with solid service &amp; a great beer selection. They are always patient with me when I ask details about the rotating IPAs.
Everything I&apos;ve eaten here (except the Caesar salad) has been delicious!  Especially try the salmon sandwich and their Reuben...the best in town.","Down low is this ....
Tried the special stroganoff it was good...not great not worth the $$ my girl had the chicken sandwich she said it was tasty but a bit messy liked the  atmosphere of the restaurant we got more service from another waiter not our own that was disappointing she didnt even drop off the meal or come by after we got it to see how we liked it.. We will go again hope its a bit better next time for service","This is the worst experience I think I&apos;ve ever had at any establishment. The staff was irate from the beginning and made my boyfriend and I feel very unwelcome. We were yelled at after expressing our dissatisfaction with their service and the waiter ended up getting into my boyfriend&apos;s face making a scene in front of everyone. So we decided to just cut our losses, pay and leave. We will never come back here again.","Service was good. Chicken sandwich which is &quot;famous&quot; or &quot;award winning&quot; was very disappointing. Portion of chicken was small* for the price. The side of pasta salad barely made up for it. 

* Edited to add- small = imagine 3 chicken nuggets (if it was squished into one piece) on toast. 

Dinner was not worth the price. 

But, if you want a cozy warm mostly quiet pub, this is your place. Just don&apos;t order the chicken.",I stopped in for lunch hoping that they would have gluten free options for sandwiches and they had many!  Also several kinds of GF beer.  Great find for us GF folks!,"This is a nice English pub type of place.  The food really makes it standout.  They have 3 weekly specials, and delicious soups.  Off their regular menu the standouts include a Rueben sandwich, grilled chicken breast sandwich, and excellent spicy gumbo.  Good service and lots of beers on tap.","The way I understood it, this place is pretty much like a classic staple of the neighborhood. Well if that&apos;s correct, I think it could use to up its game a little bit as the competition around it increases. I stopped in for a couple of beers and considered food. I changed my mind once I saw other people get their food. It didn&apos;t look disgusting, but it seemed like I could walk a block down the street and find better food for equal (or maybe less?) money.

The beers were fine- it&apos;s just beer. I didn&apos;t notice that their HH specials were overly stellar or anything. Meh...","See three posted photos from 2/27/16: Asian pear cider ($10), hummus platter ($10), and the bowl of gumbo ($11). Crowded neighborhood locale this Saturday evening keeping the pub and kitchen staff hopping!","Friendly service with a decent selection of beers.  I ordered the Reuben, which I get every time because it has pickled red onion instead of sauerkraut, which I hate.  The taste was good, but the bread was incredibly greasy.  The fillings actually started to break through the sodden bread.  It was like they had fried the sandwich in oil.","The chicken sandwich is good as are the burgers and salads. The servings aren&apos;t huge, but adequate. 

Our server was helpful and attentive. 

There is some outside seating, which is nice in the summer.","I have been so excited to try this place because the diner experience is something that is really missing from Seattle. The thing is, you don&apos;t get that same feel if you take it to-go, and who wants to do that with eggs anyways? Making my own breakfast since before quarantine started has been a disaster. Your boy eats oatmeal every single day. What a sad life. 

As soon as the latest round of restrictions were lifted, I called up Varsity Inn to see if they would seat us. The angelic voice on the phone told me they were ecstatic to announce they would be allowing visitors. I told them that I will be right there in my pajamas. 

I felt right at home when I arrived. They are so welcoming that you feel like a part of the family. The entire vibe here gives me the feeling like I&apos;m back at an old school east coast diner. The waiter was swinging by every five minutes to make sure that I was fully zooted on my coffee. I was bouncing off the walls with excitement while eating my breakfast. 

I went for the classic eggs-sausage-pancakes combo, and was even feeling a little crazy and threw some blueberries in there. These pancakes were top notch. Maybe it&apos;s because I used the entire serving of butter and syrup, but this flavor explosion was intense. 

Truly a great breakfast experience. And you can walk down to the Burke Gilman to walk off the cals after if that&apos;s your thing. Varsity Inn is a must stop.","My office recently ordered takeout from Varsity Inn and I came to yelp to rave about how amazing the experience was. From the moment I called, the service was spectacular. The woman on the phone (really wish I knew her name) was so so so sweet, kind and patient. I want her to be my aunty lol. Everyone at the office got something different as they have a pretty wide selection of things to eat. I personally built my own omelette, you get 5 fillings for $10 and the omelette is HUGE. You also get hash browns and toast on the side. You are guaranteed to have a satisfying meal and a full tummy. You could definitely split one of their omelette meals with another person! If you&apos;re looking for a cute, easy, local breakfast/brunch spot please check out Varsity Inn! I really encourage everyone to take out from here during these trying times. They were so grateful for our business and I am so grateful for their hospitality. I will be back to eat there once this all dies down but until then I&apos;ll be taking out.","I have ate here numerous times and loved everything!  The staff is wonderful, friendly and the atmosphere very welcoming.  I usually eat breakfast - the hash browns are great.  But lunch is also good from sandwiches, great burgers and salads.  I can&apos;t say enough good about this place so if you are looking for somewhere new, consider Varsity Inn.  They are doing take out during the Covid-19 outbreak.","This is our families favorite breakfast spot!

If we go for breakfast we love getting pancakes, french toast, bacon and hash browns. All the classic breakfast your heart can desire! But the also have their specials, and there you&apos;ll find their delicious carnitas! 

Their lunch starts at 11 on weekdays and 12 on weekends and holidays! 

When we make it for lunch, the Chuck Wagon is a family favorite!

Always great and friendly service!","We are lucky enough to live across the street from this lovely diner. I cannot speak highly enough of how positive our experience is every single time we eat here. I love their extensive breakfast menu and have tried almost everything: waffles, pancakes, french toast, corn beef, omelette, grilled cheese sandwich, eggs florentine, hash browns.. and EVERYTHING is exceptional. The lovely family who runs it is so so friendly and attentive. We feel to pampered every single time. 
portion sizes are HUGE so come hungry!","Only went once, but that was enough.  I couldn&apos;t believe that a Seattle diner called the Varsity Inn wouldn&apos;t be excellent.  But it was not.  Everything was just a little off -- the Pork Chop and Eggs had thin, crummy pork chops, with underdone hash browns.  The coffee was bad too.  Sorry, Varsity, but you&apos;re a &quot;pass&quot; from now on.","The classic diner breakfast I&apos;ve been looking for! Go for the classic 2 eggs, bacon, toast, hashbrowns, and pancakes!",Honestly the  nicest people work here! No matter what they always have a smile and are so welcoming. The omelette are plentiful and super delicious .,"Love this place. Always friendly, fast and good. Old school greasy spoon. There is parking behind the restaurant and usually there is street parking.","Good food , nice people ! The service alone willl keep you coming back to this place !","Seattle is constantly growing and looks different year after year. The beautiful thing of Varsity Inn is that it&apos;s the classic diner spot IN the city.. it&apos;s hard to find something as homey as this anymore. The food is great - exactly the classic breakfast you want. Great portions, too. The staff and team are amazing and so friendly. Don&apos;t forget to call ahead to ask for daily specials!","This place is my favorite Seattle breakfast place. Not only is the food delicious and satisfying, but the staff are very attentive and kind. Their pricing is reasonable, especially compared to their portions. Highly recommend!","Service was terrible. Spoke with our waiter once. Meanwhile everyone else in the restaurant was helping so we never got a consistent face.
Food was the worst. I had bacon, eggs, and hash browns. Didn&apos;t know you could mess them up but apparently it is very possible.
The hash browns tasted like lighter fluid and were a strange consistency. 
Never going back
Avoid if you like good food and service!","Very consistent diner. I won&apos;t say it&apos;s the best in Seattle but I&apos;ve been coming here for years and the food is always hot and fresh, coffee is always tasty and refilled regularly, and service is friendly. What more can
You ask for in a diner?  Most recently I came on a Wednesday around 10 a.m. and it was completely empty. I decided to splurge so I ordered the blueberry pancake combo which comes with two huge, plate-sized pancakes, two eggs and two pieces of sausage(or bacon). I also ordered a side of hash browns because I&apos;m very picky about them and am on a mission to find some that are cooked correctly. Pancakes were amazing and loaded with fresh blueberries. Sausage was yummy and eggs were cooked precisely how I ordered them. Sadly I did not like the hash browns. They were brown and crispy on the outside(yummy) but raw and uncooked inside. This is how they are served at almost every diner I frequent. Am I overly picky?  Is this how they are supposed to be served?  Maybe I just don&apos;t like hash browns. Despite the hash browns this is a very delicious little diner. Parking can be tricky but they do have designated spots right out front. They do fill up quickly though. Gas works park is within walking distance if you need to burn off some of those carbs you just ingested.",Great breakfast! Friendly and prompt. Clean and safe- we are visiting from Texas- we will be back,"I love a good diner brunch! Came here Sunday for brunch with some friends. We came around noon so we could order off breakfast or lunch. 

We ordered:
- chicken fried steak
- corned beef hash
- chicken sandwich 
- Western Beef
- side of fries

I had the corned beef hash, typical corned beef. I enjoyed my food. Looked like everyone else enjoyed their meals as well! 

This place has a small parking lot, but if you don&apos;t find a spot in there, there&apos;s plenty of street parking around the area.","I&apos;m 30 and I&apos;ve been coming here since I was in 6th grade. Best pancakes in town and I don&apos;t care about those hipster places on the Cap Hill and Ballard (yeah, I&apos;ve been to plenty of those). 

Coffee is standard, eggs always done right, and any breakfast special involving Mexican food is spot on!","As a veteran eater of ham and cheese omelettes, I can attest that the BACON and CHEESE three-egg omelette is totally outstanding.  The staff was almost too happy.......really great service.  5-star fo sho","Been coming here for years-- mostly for breakfast!  Their omelettes are fabulous, so are the hash browns.. great selection of breakfast dishes.  One problem is that I am disabled, and walking is difficult for me.  The on-street parking surrounding the restaurant is uneven, gravel, mud, etc. and a little harder for me to traverse. But worth it for the great egg dishes. Cheerful service.","Our experience at Varsity Inn was great! We came in for breakfast around 10am on a Monday and were placed at a sunny table by the window. The interior is very comfy and sweet, with old school booths, plants hanging about and cute decorations. It definitely feels like a place old friends meet up at for their weekly catch-up to grumble about how everything is changing and gossip about their neighbors. And to enjoy the food.
Their breakfast selection is pretty decent - good prices, and from what we ordered, good portions. I stuck with a cinnamon roll and bowl of fruit and was really happy with that. I&apos;m not sure if the roll was fresh or made in-house, but it was still warm, fluffy and flavorful. The fruit was also all fresh and good-quality. Those at our table also had a corned beef hash and breakfast burrito and were surprised by how much food they were given! They had enough to take for lunch. We had some food sensitivities in our group, and the waitress was really helpful in suggesting how to order what they were interested in so as to accommodate those needs. And, the kitchen didn&apos;t just take out the parts that were requested to be left out - they actually substituted them with more of other ingredients (ex. a burrito with chorizo but no eggs became a burrito overflowing with chorizo) instead of leaving them some sad half of a dish. We were really happy with the service and the kindness of the whole staff. 
Tl;dr - Good old-fashioned diner food in a cozy environment with sweet service. If I lived closer, I&apos;d definitely come back here often, and I&apos;ll probably find some excuse to make the trip again soon!","My fiance and I stumbled upon this food truck at the Magnuson Thursday Market. My fiance LOVES shrimp &amp; grits, along with anything pork belly related. He immediately stopped and suggested we get something although we had already been to 3 other food trucks/eaten/was in the middle of eating some shaved ice.

We decided on getting the pork belly and grits over the shrimp and grits because my future husband&apos;s love for pork belly might be more then his love for shrimp and grits. We added an over easy egg for $1 more. The food came out fairly quickly. We were going to try to wait till we got to the car where we could drop off some of our leftovers before digging in, but it smelled too good. The grits with the pork belly flavor and melted fat mixed in was AMAZING. There was a good amount of pork belly as well. The collard greens were really good and flavorful as well. It was literally one of those movie moments where you just take a bite of something with no expectations, your eyes widen as you realize how good something is and you just can&apos;t stop shoveling in food. My fiance tried it and ended up eating it the rest of the way home. 

The lady at the counter was super nice, although she made a face when she saw me eating my shaved ice, asking what it was. Let me enjoy my sugar water without judgement lady! The food did come out super quick, and I can&apos;t wait to come back to try the shrimp and grits.","Found this food truck driving around West Seattle enjoying the sunny weather. Masked up and ordered the shrimp and grits. OH MY! Amazing! The shrimp was cooked perfectly! The grits were creamy and the mushroom, bacon, topping added another level to the already well seasoned grits.  A good size serving with a generous amount of shrimp. If you want to add more butter it comes with a pat you can add but it doesn&apos;t really need any. Started following them on Facebook so we can track where they are. This may be a new Saturday thing for us! Thank you!","Grits could use a little more flavor/love &amp; portions could get a little bit bigger (or lower the price for the current portion)

*dear yelp, we don&apos;t have time for long reviews, we just want to know if we&apos;ll get food poisoning or not.","Probably the best shrimp and grits I&apos;ve ever had! I was walking around the Fremont Sunday market just to get some sun, saw this truck and decided to try it out. I&apos;m happy I decided on the shrimp and grits and got an egg on top as well. The pieces of bacon and the slices of mushroom added to the savoriness of the dish. The grits tasted good on their own, but all the components put together made it extra delicious.","I&apos;m a fan of grits. I&apos;ve never made them but I eat them a lot. By far, my favorite dish on the truck is the shrimp and grits. My shrimp has been perfectly cooked every single time I&apos;ve ordered it. I do not like over- or underdone shrimp. The consistency here has blown me away every time. The key to the dish is getting a bite of everything - shrimp, bacon, mushrooms, and grits. The saltiness of the bacon, the earthiness of the mushrooms, the punch of the garlic, and the texture of the grits combined with the tender shrimp is enough to keep me coming back for more! 

When I&apos;m not in the mood for shrimp (which is almost never), I get the pork belly served adobo style with collard greens. It has good balance and the collards have a hearty texture. The pickled onions add an unexpected twist to the dish. 

Recently, the truck switched to Adluh grits. They are very fluffy and pleasant to eat. Overall, service is always friendly and the food comes out faster than I would expect. I tend to see the truck at special events but they have a regular route during the week.","Forget all those other places who attempt to grits or say they do them well. They are quite frankly all bullshit. The chef of KMG is from the south and knows REAL grits. I ordered two meals: one for lunch, one for dinner. 

Lunch: I opted to try the pork belly w/grits and collards because cold grits, reheated just aren&apos;t the best. I dove in while sitting in the parking lot. The pork belly was perfectly seasoned. The pickled onions were a nice acidic accent. And those grits...Francine...those grits were just right. Creamy but not runny. Smooth not hard. Seasoned but not salty or sugary (because apparently some people think you add sugar to grits). The only think I like better than a good bowl of grits is cheese grits but I can understand how the cheese would&apos;ve taken away from everything else lol. My only regret: I didn&apos;t put some hot sauce on it before I drove off lol.

Dinner: I had my other meal, the Return of the Mac. Once again, mac done RIGHT and not Seattle style. Normally I am not a fan of any Mac that&apos;s not thoroughly baked to the point of a cheese crust on top but you could tell this sauce was at least made from a good roux as only southerners would do it lol. The pulled pork and bbq sauce on top wasn&apos;t over powering although there was a little more pork than I would&apos;ve liked (that&apos;s a personal thing). However, it was still tender and flavorful.

I will definitely be looking out for them again. Probably to try the shrimp and grits - a southern classic!","Cracking tasty! Give them your cash! She&apos;s extremely amiable, and he&apos;s extremely kind. Their sustenance is high caliber at a reasonable cost!","Loved the shrimp and grits. Creamy, buttery grits with a good number of shrimp saut√©ed with garlic, bacon and mushrooms. The portion was big enough to share.","The first time I visited this truck, I liked it.  It was during the annual Taco Truck challenge in Volunteer Park and though they weren&apos;t selling anything but tacos for the competition, the staff was kind and the shrimp &amp; lime tacos were awesome.  

But, this past Sunday this truck was at the Mercer Island Farmer&apos;s Market.  I ordered the Adobo with grits and collard greens, which I was so excited to finally try since learning about it during my first visit to Kiss My Grits.  But when I was paying for it, the cashier already added tip and asked me to sign for it.  Okay, I didn&apos;t realize you can read my mind and tip for yourself...  So that was pretty lame.  And when I got my food, the adobo was not nearly enough for the portion of grits they give you.  It was also dry, so not very tasty.  The collard greens were good - but like the adobo, the portion wasn&apos;t much.  The grits I found meh.  They weren&apos;t exceptional -- definitely not ordering this meal again.  Especially because I&apos;m still so offended that they would tip for themselves.","I got the pork belly grits. I had grits that I really liked in SF and that was the last time. I had it about a year ago.

I was at the food truck rodeo at the Fremont market. I didn&apos;t see anything else that sounded good to me, so I decided to get the pork belly grits. 

Overall I really enjoyed it, especially the pickled purple onions. They gave an okay amount of pork belly, but I feel like the price was kinda expensive for the size of the meal ($10 but I added an egg for $1).","Shrimp and grits were slow to serve, mushy and flavorless. They were out of egg which I ordered. If this is the dish they base the truck on it was total miss.","Omg! Had them for the first time today and they are so amazing.

We have the food truck here at our offices and i needed this fix. i love the combinations and the flavor is right on point. 

The seasoning is on point and the flavors work so well together. i will definitely be back.","I had the Pork Belly and grits y&apos;day with a fried egg. As good a grits as I&apos;ve had outside of my own kitchen. It all blends together into a tasty bite depending on which side you eat off of. A bite of collards here (once again, as good as I&apos;ve had outside of my own collards with salt pork), pickled onions there and so on...

Thanks Mike for a fine meal! I look forwards to trying all of your creations!","Inedible food. I ordered the shrimp and grits and ended up throwing it out and buying a new lunch. The shrimp was undercooked and flavorless. The grits had a terrible texture and were not cooked properly. The dish was also incredibly greasy -- the few bites I took just tasted like eating straight grease. I also had an upset stomach later that day which I&apos;m pretty sure was from the undercooked shrimp. I&apos;m not sure if i just hit the truck when they had a substitute cook or something, since most of the reviews are pretty good, but I won&apos;t be back to find out. Terrible experience!","Would give this 0 stars if I could. Grits have a weird taste to it. Doesn&apos;t seem legit/authenticate from shrimp and grits that I&apos;ve had. Do not, and I repeat, do NOT get their Funky Chicken. Absolutely disgusting. This is supposed be Mac n cheese but it&apos;s not. It&apos;s like a dry pasta.","Tried the shrimp and grits with a fried egg for $11. There were 6 pieces of shrimp, lots of grits, and a few bacon pieces. It was pretty filling but of course, it&apos;s grits. Most of flavor comes from the bacon, which is good, but I wish there was more going on. It was a-ok but not good enough that I would order it again. It was worth a try.","5 minutes after 12noon for a lunch truck and out of Shrimp and Grits...

Nuff, said...","No, just no. I don&apos;t like to come down too hard on a place after one try, but the Mac &amp; Cheese I just bought at their truck in Magnuson Park is terrible! Mush with zero flavor, wow is this bad.","First of all, the grits had the texture of and more-or-less tasted like rice. I&apos;m not from the south, nor have I had grits super often, but I&apos;ve still had much better. 

After we&apos;d eaten, some friends ordered some food from elsewhere, so my girlfriend briefly borrowed their hot sauce so they could use it. Almost immediately after she&apos;d brought it back to the table, the owner (?) came up to us and demanded his hot sauce back. This was his right, but it felt very rude and when combined with the mediocre food, it led up to a bad experience. I will actively avoid ordering from them in the future.","Such good food that they&apos;re catering my wedding even though I worked there and so have had the food over and over again. Mike is the best. 

Update:
They catered my wedding in June of 2016 and worked well with my coordinator and vendor and were a huge hit with my family. Mike is accommodating, professional and a ton of fun! I would recommend him for anyone to cater or just for lunch.",Gosh I miss this spot.  My favorite go to for breakfast or lunch. They make the best Reuben in town. I miss the awesome customer service.  Always greeted my Marquis who remembers us each visit and we tease back and forth. Take out is not the same as enjoying our meal there. Freshest ingredients always and they are always willing to accommodate and rational requests.  Looking forward to them opening up again. My weekend mornings just aren&apos;t the same. Miss you guys.,"Oh Julia&apos;s! Such a classic in this neighborhood where new restaurants are popping up all the time. When we were recently looking for brunch I was happy to see they&apos;re still around!

It was a Sunday morning so the wait was a few minutes - but not bad and, soon enough, we were seated and enjoying super friendly service and (of course) mimosas while we waited for our food. I got the spinach benny and, nomnomnom, it was so good. The hollandaise definitely tastes house-made and the side of potatoes were soooo good I was disappointed I couldn&apos;t finish it all. They also have mimosas by the pitcher and (rumor has it) will be serving up real bloody Mary&apos;s soon too. Alas, we had things to do and a pitcher of mimosas sounded more like a nap than the start to a productive day.

Great to see Julia&apos;s is still carrying on the tradition of great brunch food in Wallingford!","I&apos;m vegan and personally didn&apos;t like the food here but my parents are not vegan and they enjoyed their meals. I also used a groupon. They charge a 20% tip automatically if you use a groupon, which if you do the math on it, only works out to a $6 savings ($30 groupon for $18. 20% of $30 is $6, so you spend $24 for $30 of food). I personally do not think this is a great deal, but again I don&apos;t really like the place, so to each their own.

I called ahead to make a reservation as per the groupon instructions and that went smoothly. Day of, we were seated promptly and the staff was very friendly and helpful, although some of the staff were a bit scatter brained.

Their website says they have vegan options but they aren&apos;t labeled on the menu so I asked the waiter what vegan options they had. He said basically just the scrambles and they could substitute tofu for eggs. The scramble comes with toast and potatoes, so I asked if the toast was vegan, he went back and asked and said none of the bread options were vegan. I then asked about the potatoes and he went back again to ask and said they were vegan. He then asked if I&apos;d like to substitute fruit for the toast but failed to mention it would cost extra (although in retrospect it was on their menu).

I ordered a scramble with OLIVES and mushrooms and received a scramble with ONIONS and mushrooms. I did not tell the waiter of the error because it would have been a waste if food that I was able to eat, but it was definitely not what I ordered. It was incredibly bland and I was dousing it with hot sauce every bite. 

My parents enjoyed the meals they ordered and their orders came out correctly.","Bf loved his chicken fried steak. He said it was made right in the southern way which is rare in Seattle. I am vegan so I had tofu scramble which was mediocre. 

Yelp deal or Groupon deal is great though. I may come back if I happen to be in the neighborhood. But I wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to come here.","I know that Julia&apos;s has wonderful food, and I&apos;ve been delighted to eat there in the past.  But today, my partner and I called in advance around noon to make a reservation for a party of two.  The woman on the phone said that they don&apos;t ordinarily take reservations for parties of two, but that if we showed up in about 15 or 20 minutes, we should be fine.  We arrived starving, with one party of two (no reservations), waiting ahead of us.  We were told we would be seated next.

Then three other parties arrived who did have reservations (one party was even early).  And one of them was a party of two!  The host was apologetic, but said they had to be seated because they had reservations.  Had I known any of this, I would have *made* reservations--but I was told they wouldn&apos;t take them and we wouldn&apos;t need them.

After about ten minutes of waiting and watching at least four other parties get seated, we left and went elsewhere.  I&apos;m saddened and disappointed, because I like Julia&apos;s.  But something was tickling at the back of my brain about why I don&apos;t eat there habitually.  This kind of thing may have been the reason.","Love coming to Julia&apos;s!  We used to live in the area and would come all the time, but since we moved to Shoreline  our visits have been rare.  We were in the area and decided a Julia&apos;s brunch was a must.

We got a mimosa pitcher for $16, and it was a nice sized pitcher too!  For food we got the chicken fried steak with sour dough toast, two eggs over medium, and oatmeal buckwheat pancakes.  The eggs were cooked perfectly!  The pancakes were a little dry, probably due to the oatmeal.  I usually get just buckwheat pancakes, but decided to try the oatmeal buckwheat ones.  Next time I think I&apos;ll go back to the plain buckwheat ones.


The staff were friendly and checked in frequently.  Nothing negative to say, but also nothing spectacular to rave about.","Was looking forward to the place after a friends recommendation and would totally come back! Had the chicken and waffles and the biscuit and gravy - both were delicious paired with a weekend brunch hour mimosa deal with a pitcher for only $16! I would say, even with just two entrees it felt like only a little bit of food and I didn&apos;t leave &quot;stuffed&quot;, so I&apos;d say ordering some sides or some toast on the side is a fair bet! Otherwise, everything was awesome!","2 weeks ago I was here w/ 2 r
Friends for brunch. Our server was Lauren. When she brought the menu, I playfully touched her hand. She brought the ticket when we were finished &amp; told me I was no longer welcome there. Tnen the me came over &amp; asked us to leave even though there were several empty tables. I&apos;m asking all my friends to no longer eat @ Julia&apos;s",This is a pretty cool little breakfast place I like Wallingford it&apos;s more of a family the place then Fremont so this is more for family I guess laid back Little Hippie but the food was good but I ordered the berry French toast which is pretty good nice flavored like the spices as little crispy some best French toast I&apos;ve had I think actually our server was nice and friendly she&apos;s the one that suggested the French toast with a server that brought our food was very rude and nasty ask her for some syrup she gave me a dirty look and said something under her breath not sure what her deal was but I would definitely go back,"I&apos;ve been here before and it&apos;s always fine--not great, but fine! But this time was absurd. We waited for a while to get in, no problem. We waited for our food for a while, also no problem! It was busy, we totally understood.

But then every group who came in after us started getting their food. Ours never came and we got no explanation. Eventually, every single group after ours had been served. We asked and were told it was almost up, repeatedly. 

We tried to stick it out, but almost two hours after we&apos;d arrived, we had to leave to find food elsewhere. This sucked a lot and it felt like our food had gotten lost but no one was looking out for us. I recommend you steer clear.","We went to Juila&apos;s in the morining for Sunday brunch. This was our second visitis but this seems to be the last. The food was ok, the eggs in our benedict was over cooked and not runny at all. The potatoes were cold so was the coffee. But my main issue is the sneaky billing prctices, the bill came with an automatically gratualtiy of 18% on the total amount and then there was suggested tip section also. The usual practice is if there is an auto gratuity applied then there is no obouis suggestion for tipping.","I have gone to this restaurant here and there over the last 15 years.  It has always been a really hit and miss place.  Most of the time, the things I order are mediocre - not terrible but leaving you wishing you has tried somewhere else.  But every once in a while, something will be really amazing and I keep giving them another shot when I need a bite in the area.",The food is great here but the service is horrible and made the server made you felt unwelcome for the whole time while dining. They need to really work on improving their service from the server.,"They made us wait for 30 minutes despite having a reservation.
My cappuccino only had foam and espresso and I asked why there was no steamed milk. I was rudely instructed saying--&quot;that&apos;s how cappuccino was supposed to be&quot;
We ordered Huevos Rancheros and they were nothing like how they are supposed to be.

The two stars are for the California eggs Benedict, which was delicious. 

Definitely avoiding this place in the future.","Being a big fan of Julia&apos;s on Broadway,  I was looking forward to a yummy breakfast yesterday at Julia&apos;s in Wallingford.  The whole experience was a big let down.

We were seated and eventually a server took our orders.  The food arrived about 12-15 minutes later, and that was the last contact we had with a server unless we left the table to get what we needed ourselves.  There was no sugar or any other condiment on the table nor were any offered to us.  Beverages, even water, were not refreshed or refilled.  We tried to signal the staff for assistance but were ignored.  At best, the food was mediocre with overcooked eggs and barely warm potatoes.  By the way, the restaurant was not in the least busy.

We did not make a fuss or send back any food.  Possibly because we couldn&apos;t get anyone&apos;s attention.  However, almost full plates were left on the table and no staff inquired if there was a problem.  We couldn&apos;t even get a thank you when the bill was paid.

We won&apos;t be returning to Julia&apos;s in Wallingford...ever.","Came on Memorial Day for brunch (the menu given to us was only breakfast). The restaurant is in a great location right off of 45th in Wallingford. We were seated immediately and Kyle was our server for the morning. Mimosas were good and decent size for $6.50. We ordered 3 plates to share between the two of us and our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs. The French Toast could have been in the batter for a little bit longer, and the orange is very subtle. The hash browns were a little soft for my preference but still good. Nothing was overly salty or too sweet and it all hit the spot. They have this strawberry topping on the table and it reminded me of something my mom used to make, very good. Kyle was personable and helpful. Will come back if in the area for breakfast.

We used the $20 for $35 deal from the Yelp app and had no problems.","Ok.... I may not be politically correct here, but this place is effing amazeballs! My gf and just arrived last night and went to breakfast this morning. We scouted the menu online and then headed right over. We had discussed, well maybe not, I guess just decided right as we were sitting down that we would like the waitress to order our food for us. Thanks Laura, we really arent illiterate, just wanted you to get us whatever you thought was amazing! She picked our breakfast staples NOT EVEN KNOWING US! Her service was great and the food, well let&apos;s just say Tucson has a hard time matching this! Hand down if you are in the Seattle area this is a must stop! Portions are large! Coffee was amazing as well! I cant stop raving about this place!!!!!!!","Best brunch in Wallingford if not all of Seattle!!! The menu is so extensive - it&apos;s tough to decide! Luckily they are quick to refill your coffee while you ponder. I decided on the California Benedict with homemade hollandaise on the side and fruit instead of hash browns. The fruit is so fresh!!! The eggs were beautiful poached, the tomato cooked to perfection, the avocado at ideal ripeness and the English muffin nicely toasted. I highly recommend this spot!","Came here with my mom, ordered the salmons eggs Benedict and she got the California. The portions are pretty large and it was quite tasty! The people were super friendly, we got in pretty quickly even tho there was a little wait. The food was pretty average, so I probably wouldn&apos;t come back but it was good.","Seasonal Fresh Berries French Toast - I just want to say that this French toast is bomb-dot-com. The waiter said it was going to be &quot;stupid good&quot;, and she wasn&apos;t lying; I can tell you that much. I&apos;d highly recommend if you like a sweeter breakfast that&apos;s balanced with the tartiness of berries. 10/10.","After getting delivery from here twice, this is now my favorite wing place. This is the first wing place I&apos;ve been to ever that actually makes your wings extra wet when you ask for them extra wet. My wings were practically drowning in all of that triple garlic and 5 alarm goodness. I wish the Buffalo came in varying degrees of heat but that&apos;s just splitting hairs.","Always a great restaurant, with amazing food. With Covid there are definitely complications but they remain the best wing joint in Seattle, giving watching sports with my family the same feeling as any sports bar.","Got takeout from Wing Dome and it was really fresh and tasty! My partner and I love to get the 18-piece traditional wings. Our favorite sauces are honey habanero, 3-alarm spice, and thai sweet chili (you can get a new sauce for every 6 wings). We also ordered tots and fries on the side! Tots were great - would get again and maybe swap the fries for another of our favorites... the fried pickles!","Yum my second order!! 12 peace wings 4 alarm and Honey Habanero dry rub... The wings range from small to medium but totally hit the spot tonight !! 

Really love the 4 star (listed in my last review incorrectly as 5 star )","These wings were as dry as the Sahara desert. Each bite felt like biting into a chewy rubber chicken. To top it off, the sauces (we got 3, bbq, and Thai chili) were horribly bland. The Thai chili was the only palatable one - the 3 had no flavor - and bbq tasted like it was from bottle of generic bbq sauce from Walmart.

The waffle fries were good, but this is a wings restaurant made to satisfy wings cravings so it gets 1 star.","The wings were great, but they were a bit small compared to most other places. Buffalo, 3Alarm, and Jerk were all delicious.",First timer here and I was disappointed. The wings were smaller and much drier than expected. None of my wings were juicy and unfortunately I&apos;d rather eat at wing stop or bww than this :(. Only good thing was the cheese sauce.,"The quality of the wings were no where&apos;s near worth the price we were charged for them. We were looking forward to eating some big meaty wings and excited to try some new flavors and were sadly disappointed in the whole experience. The food was dropped off and then we were never checked on and no, the restaurant wasn&apos;t overly busy, not with the amount of staff on at the time. Definitely expected more from any place on the waterfront in Seattle.",I was never much of a wing person until I tried them here.  I am working my way through trying everything on the menu and so far everything has been delicious. My favorites are the Frank&apos;s Buffo and the cheese wings.  The dip sticks and the waffle fries with hot sauce and blue cheese are pretty good too!,"This review is for Grubhub delivery.

The wings were run of the mill and the loaded waffle fries were tasty. 

The restaurant forgot to include my ranch dressing, which is a huge pet peeve of mine.

If you are looking for an easy guilty pleasure dinner, worth trying but know that the delivery wasn&apos;t flawless.","Came in here with a friend and had the cheese curds, fried pickles and triple garlic wings.  The cheese curds were great, but the pickles were somewhat bland and soggy.  The serving size was large.  The wings had great flavor and crispness.  They were small to medium in size.The service was prompt, friendly and accurate.  I would come back if craving wings and in the area.","There&apos;s nothing more American than this. The wings, the atmosphere, and the music they play. We came here for an appetizer-ish meal before the actual dinner to warm up our tummies, and it did the job well. 

We got the loaded waffle fries, 6 piece wing with 4 alarm spice, and an IPA. They did an outstanding job with the waffle fries. (I would come back for this if I happen to be in the area again). though the wing was a little bit over-cooked.( This could just be an objectively personal preference.) Overall, it was very reasonably priced; the staff was fairly friendly; food was solid. Go give them a try if you&apos;re ever craving for some American wings &amp; fries.","GOING WILD FOR WING WEDNESDAY&apos;S!!!

I&apos;ve been here three times, all on Wednesday&apos;s for unlimited wings (or as I call it: training for the 7 Alarm Challenge)! The service here is understandably slow on WW, so be patient and order more wings before you finish your current portion. They&apos;re served 12 at first and then 6 at a time; the staff does a good job to reminding you to order before you finish. My little tip is to order really spicy wings and very mild wings so you can give your taste buds some respite... helps you pack more in! Also, if you want a side - check out the waffle fries.

I recommend:
- the 5 Alarm
- the 6 Alarm (it&apos;s much spicier than 5... makes me nervous between the difference of the 6 and 7!)
- Chipotle
- Honey Mustard

My only complaint is that $17.99 for unlimited wings is misleading since you MUST purchase a drink to get this deal. I like the unlimited refills on the Arnold Palmer I get, but I&apos;d prefer to just drink water and keep my bill under $20+tip like we&apos;re lead to believe! Overall, decent place with good food and friendly staff whether you&apos;re paying $18 or $22.","This was our absolute favorite place which we used to order once every week and the taste continues to be good but the wing size has gone downhill with barely any meat on the pieces, it&apos;s like they source left over chicken. This happened a couple of years back but we have tried them multiple times after and things haven&apos;t changed. I don&apos;t think we look forward to ordering from here. 2 star for the flavor!",I ordered via Uber eats and they forgot to sauce my wings. I ordered 4 alarm wings and received 6 wings with nothing on them. Total waste of money.,"Wings were small, dry, tasted horrible and wrong sauces were included with the order.  Cheese triangles were overspiced and underheated and dry. This within a half hour of their opening, and picked up not delivered.  Never again.","As a long-time fan of Wing Dome, I was disappointed this week to see that they were not enforcing mask-wearing rules. There were people waiting to be seated inside the entry - without masks, and several people going to and from the restrooms - without masks. Since it is State Law that masks be worn inside businesses, I would expect wing Dome management to require that their patrons comply. I don&apos;t want to be forced to eliminate Wing Dome from our short list of safe / compliant inside dining options during Covid-19.","DO NOT go to Wing Dome in Greenwood!  I placed the order to go and spent $60 plus tip.  Their wings where nasty.  The were dry rubbery, tasteless with the bland sauce, the skin was rubbery plus they where extremely small.  My boss who ate his wing order right away at the restaurant even said they were dry.  When I called Wing Dome the servers response was laughable.  She implied that I was at fault for the dry wings because I called 4 hours later. When I asked to speak to the manager she told me to call back in the morning. Save your money.","Was here last night food was good, service was not bad and the staff were very friendly. I enjoyed my time here with the co workers and really had a good time. I would definitely come over again with wife and friends.",I love Wing Dome it&apos;s probably one of the better wing places in Seattle good flavors they make the wings crispy the service is pretty good a good selection of beers and there super hot wing is pretty good I think my favorite was the 4 alarm good enough to spice but not too hot can&apos;t stand it their garlic fries were amazing the garlic cheese bread was okay the marinara disgusting has spit it out tasted spoiled overall pretty good place,"Wonderful heated outdoor seating and delicious food. We went here on a somewhat drizzly day, but stayed cozy thanks to the heaters near each table. 
They are using online ordering for dine-in, and there is a self-serve drinking water station, handwashing station, takeout boxes, and utensils. There is a very small amount of direct contact.
Food was delicious. We also tried the fries which were so perfectly crispy. 
We didn&apos;t visit the banana window or get any of their cocktails, but surely will be back.","We were looking for a place with outdoor seating, that was convenient for the 3 of us meeting and found this place. They have outdoor seating with heaters, the tables with lot of space between them, contactless ordering and payment( they have an app or a QRcode to start the ordering process).

I got the Aperol Sprtiz and Crab Spaghetti. I enjoyed my drink and loved the crab spaghetti, lots of crab in an amazing sauce. The portion was the right size for me. 

Now that I have discovered this place, I&apos;ll be back.","Loved the frozen alcoholic beverages here. I got one with jalape√±os in it and boy did it have a kick. These were a bit small in size for the price but I felt like I was supporting a local business amidst the pandemic, so I didn&apos;t mind. My friend posted a pic of their POG, and I&apos;m not gonna lie... that&apos;s what I was really craving. A refreshing treat on a warm day... plus it&apos;s a banana stand... how can you not?","A very cozy place for a Sunday brunch :)
The vibe was so cozy and warm (the heaters helped). The place has a very homey vibe.
We ordered the chicken waffle, the french toast, and the croque madame. The chicken waffle was a classic, solid option. The french toast was ideal since it wasn&apos;t too sweet, but probably not the best one I&apos;ve had. The croque madame had a delicious bechamel sauce, but not the best I&apos;ve had. However, all the meals we ordered were pleasant enough :)
Overall, I would go back for a Sunday brunch someday to try out their other options, as well as their drinks!","Steak burrito is more like a steak wrap - light on beans heavy on steak and eggs (this is a good thing.)

Staff is VERY friendly.","Worth the trip to Maple Leaf! Fish Fry is exceptional. Beautiful thick cuts of cod, seasoned perfectly - fries are crispy and cut and seasoned just right, not too thick or thin; not soggy or over-seasoned. Absolutely memorable sauces, seasonings, dressings made by someone who knows exactly what they&apos;re doing in the kitchen. Fried Chicken sandwich is unforgettable with an un-replicatable seasoning and topped by, yes, deliciously unique giarinara carrots and pickle chips (Potato chip size!). The banana stand pick up  window is perfect for take out. They serve walking cocktails, too from the window and the Maple Leaf track and park is just across the street for picnicking or walking it all off. Perfect place to watch the sun set over the city with friends or family. Plus the best, most helpful Ace hardware store in town is right across the street. Math N Stuff game and toy shop is right there too. Really great little jaunt and so far everything on the menu has been made with love, care and talent (quite a mean burger, too). Staff and service has been outstanding. Street parking is easy to navigate and there is a pick up lane for take out. Heated outdoor beer garden is super sweet.  Thank you, Maple! :) ~ Tina","We happened upon The Maple on NYE.  Perfect outdoor set up--completely open, but covered.  Most powerful outdoor heater at our table--even took hat and coat off briefly!  There is also an outdoor handwashing station.  Super impressed with all the precautions they&apos;ve taken.

Steak frites with truffle salt were delish.  That blue cheese butter--I mean really!  My date appreciated the fried chicken sandwich so much--I didn&apos;t even get a bite.

Celery gin and tonic is a winner.  Tonic and bitter celery were the perfect match.  

Cute, inviting space with great service and tunes.","Such a creative cocktail selection! I had the Little Kicks (house infused jalapeno tequila?- yes please!) as well as a beetroot margarita. YUM! Super tasty, strong, and different than you can get anywhere else. We also got the fish and chips. These were ok- bread crumbs rather than beer batter but the fish was still fresh which is the most important thing for me!",We love The Maple! My housemates and I live close by and have loved coming here during COVID because of the outdoor heated seating. Great to grab dinner and cocktails or just a beer and French fries.,"I&apos;ve been coming to The Maple over the last 3 years occasionally. I&apos;ve always loved this place,  but recently I have started to love it even more. This restaurant is in a cute little neighborhood in North Seattle (conveniently right next to my work) and they offer a good selection of food and drinks. They have a nice outdoor patio seating as well as indoor.
During the covid pandemic it has been pretty hard to find restaurants that offer a good selection nd fast and efficient service. However The Maple offers both of those things! Their new food ordering system is one of the best I have seen yet. They are quick nd super easy. You can get yourself a meal and drinks and be out within 30 minutes if needed!
I&apos;ve had just about everything on their menu and its all delicious.
I always recommend thi place to my friends and family and will continue to do so!","What a cool restaurant in the heart of the cute Maple Leaf neighborhood! I have driven by here so many times and thought it was someone&apos;s house. It feels super cozy inside with lots of natural light and seating by the windows. The accoustics can be a little jarring when there&apos;s a loud group near the entrance, but I chose to sit far away from them and wasn&apos;t bothered by it in the opposite corner of the front room.

The server was a sweet guy with a bright and fun personality, creating a good vibe for the brunch environment on a rainy weekend. I had the cauliflower and asparagus with poached eggs - perfectly poached eggs are so decadent on anything and this dish was a dream for this ova-lacta-pescatarian! I requested no bacon and that was no issue. My friend ordered the avocado toast and loved it as well. The coffee was good and the drink menu was inventive. My friend had a fun purple one that packed a punch! I&apos;ll have to try out some of the others in the future.","Always have great service and the food is always amazing. I love this place, it&apos;s so great for brunch! Especially on a sunny day, it&apos;s perfect.","Takeout- ordered the brussel sprouts, risotto, and fries. All were delish and generous portions. When I arrived, order was ready all the employees were wearing their masks. We def be back!","I wanted to try a new brunch spot, and noticed this place was super close to home. My friend and I came in at around 12:30 on a Sunday so given, there was a tiny wait. But they cleared a table and we were able to sit down pretty quickly.

I had ordered a pint of mimosa which was only $7. If you live in Seattle, that&apos;s good. Normally that&apos;s a price for a flute, so the prices for drinks were definitely affordable. 

Our food came and the presentation was great. The only reason I&apos;m docking one star is because both my friend and I felt like our food was a little under-seasoned, and even my dish was a little cold upon arrival. I like food to be super hot before I start eating, so this just may be a biased opinion.

Overall, it&apos;s a super comforting and cozy vibe. The staff was very friendly and checked in frequently. And I&apos;m eager to try their dinner/happy hour menu.",I&apos;d give The Maple a 3.5! I have been here several times for brunch and happy hour. I like how their menu is simple and seasonal. Food and service are pretty good as well with reasonable prices. It is a smaller space but still can accommodate groups. Most recently I came here for brunch and ordered the two egg breakfast. The sausage wasn&apos;t that great and the toast didn&apos;t come with butter or jam. I also got tazo earl grey tea for $3.5. I liked the roasted potatoes though! My friend got the breakfast burrito which looked good and I have ordered in the past. When the weather is nice there is also an outside seating area. It is a solid neighborhood spot that I recommend. There is nothing in particular that makes it stand out in a spectacular way. Worth stopping by if you&apos;re ever in the Maple Leaf neighborhood.,"Great brunch, I felt extremely covid safe and the server was awesome to help me when I was technologically challenged!",Socially distanced tables outside and great food! Had an amazing time on the patio. The fish and chips was AMAZING. I&apos;d recommend for lunch or dinner.,Got takeout from this place yesterday and I brought it home just put it on 300 in the oven for about 5 minutes so that it&apos;s nice and warm :). They had it ready for me within 20 minutes and it was absolutely delicious!! Wish i could go in and get mimosas!,"Maybe a little too cool for school, but their Avacado toast was delicious, and the Bloody Mary was great. Lots of outdoor space, would go back","I&apos;ve been to The Maple about a dozen times since they&apos;ve opened and am always happy with my visit. Last night, we ordered take out (as we all are nowadays) via their website. I had the sheperd&apos;s pie which game with green beans and tomatoes. It was seasoned perfectly and the mash on top was thick, smooth and complemented the meat and veggies underneath. It was topped by a delicious crusty croquette. My wife had the fried chicken sandwich (which she devoured so quickly I barely got to sample) and the truffle fries. Both were packed well for takeout (even the sheperd&apos;s pie!). While we didn&apos;t get drinks this time, I highly recommend their house-made cocktails, as they&apos;ve never disappointed. The tap list is also excellent, and when dine-in reopens I&apos;m looking forward to returning for dinner and drinks again.","During quarantine, we&apos;ve been ordering family combo (pizza, salad and wings) and the burgers. We love McGilvra&apos;s burger as it has all our favorites, avocado, bacon, pickle and cheese. My husband also just chimed in and said it is fatty and juicy.","the food was ok but we ordered two beers they were hot we asked the waitress to change them and I ended up taking two more just as hot. it was like drinking hot coffee, the weather was 92.  She also seemed angry and answered rudely","Ehhh....food is ok.  The waitress was good. I had a scramble which was very watery.  The others liked their corned beef hash and fish and chips.  Mimosas were nice.  I didn&apos;t want toast with my breakfast and the waitress said I could get extra fruit instead.  She later came back and said the manager said fruit was more expensive than toast so she would have to charge for extra fruit. It felt a little petty.  The manager should have told the waitress in the future we have to charge extra.
I live in the neighborhood and probably won&apos;t go back.",I was having lunch and a man asked the hostess to sit outside and she snapped very aggressively at him. She was so rude I asked to cash out and I left. I don&apos;t like seeing patrons treated disrespectfully,"The 3/5 star rating of &quot;A-OK&quot; fits the bill for McGilvra&apos;s. Not bad..Not great. We had the cheeseburger which was fine. I think the worst part was our beer was warm :( 
On the day we came in, they seemed pretty understaffed. I&apos;d give them another shot but will not be my first choice in the Madison Park area.","On July 7, 2019
 I was dining at Mcgilvra&apos;s Bar and Restaurant when I found a fly in the drink they had served me; before I had even taken a sip. When I asked the woman in charge that evening for a replacement her only reply was &quot;That&apos;s what happens when you eat outside&quot;.   They would not take my drink away as if I were expected to drink it. 
Their outside dining area had a couple of spots where flys had bunched up because of their unsanitary practices.  I would like to file a civil complaint on Mcgilvra&apos;s for endangering the public due to their conduct. Please send me the proper forms to initiate a civil suit in district court where I can also be allowed punitive damages if the court sees fit.

This was embarrassing to me that Mcgilvra&apos;s would shift the blame to me in this situation and endanger my health over something so small as a drink because of the cleanliness of their eating area. I will never eat there or anywhere near that area again. Their conduct is abhorrent and dangerous to the public in my opinion.

Nothing crazy to write home about, but that doesn&apos;t mean anything was poor or bad. Maybe just lacks a certain &quot;x&quot; factor, but that&apos;s not really the reason why you&apos;d go to a place like McGilvra&apos;s in the first place. 
The two bar staff were more pleasant  than I&apos;ve experienced in the past, and were very accommodating to my friend who doesn&apos;t drink by providing her with 2 different types of mocktails. Certainly not overbearing, and were defiantly attentive.","As a local who lives in walking distance I only go to Mcgilvra&apos;s when: Cactus is too busy, I have my kid with me (you can&apos;t bring kids to the Attic), because Bing&apos;s is gone, and I&apos;m looking to watch sports (The Independent Pizzeria doesn&apos;t have TV&apos;s).","I would&apos;ve given this place one star had the server not been so sweet; therefore, the additional star is for the friendly service.  She was awesome, especially on a crazy night like St. Patty&apos;s.  My friend and I came here for the green festivity, and we ordered green beers which were Pabst (so better than Bud).  The bar scene, as expected, was loud, lively, but fun.  I just wish there was more room because the bar area is really small, and there is only one stall per bathroom for both sexes.

The food though was horrible.  My friend ordered Irish Nachos, saying how much she loved them, but was so disappointed once they came out.  It really looked like dog food with a dollop of sour cream.  The chicken was too thinly shredded and was dry.  Also, we thought the Irish Nachos would be potato wedges, which they weren&apos;t.  They instead were potato chips.  I ordered the Reuben Sandwich with Cole Slaw, and again, it was disappointing.  The corned beef seemed to be cooked unevenly, as parts of it were crispy/burnt and parts of it were soft.  Also, it was thinly stacked, so there was not enough of anything, like the corned beef or sauerkraut or russian dressing.  I was also surprised that it was served on whole wheat bread instead of marbled rye.  I don&apos;t recommend eating here.  Just come for the draanks.","I like jumping over chairs to get to my part of the table. 

Came here on a Sunday afternoon  with a group of friends. The place was deserted, and we asked to be sat on the patio since we had a large group of 7 to enjoy the view, but instead of sitting us  the main part of the patio they stuck us in the corner of the entry way after putting together 3 tables awkwardly in the corner where the chairs barely fit leading us all to climb over each chair to get to our spots. The reasoning &quot;we have a dinner rush, so we need that seating to be open&quot;. Odd. Wouldn&apos;t you want to take care of the customers you actually have there at that moment? While we were there not 1 person had actually come to the place...Shocking. 

I mean it&apos;s just an irish bar, so why hold it to regular standards? Well, every glass we got had lipstick or lips stains on them, the server didnt come out for about 20 minutes to take our simple order which went from a lets eat and drink everything, to this place sucks lets just get a bottle of wine, so instead of spending a few hundred dollars on liquour and food we had a $21 bottle of wine and I had some soup n salad. To their benefit the cesar salad was pretty good! The whisky crab bisque soup was ok a bit bland, but they had real crab in there, so i appreciated that. 

Overall though from a business standpoint it was just weird. You have a large group of young professionals looking to spend a good amount of cash at your establishment for drinks and food, but instead you make questionable decisions to negate that. 

They got a good view though! 1 Star!","So far I love this place. It&apos;s not my first visit there,  we went there at summer time at first. They have tables outside, nice view! We keep comming back every time we are around, it&apos;s a good place to come with friends and listen to live music ( they usually have it on Saturdays) .
Beer and Irish beef nachos are favorite starters!","The staff here isn&apos;t the smartest, or polite. Don&apos;t expect the staff to be able to answer questions you might have about the menu or daily special&apos;s. Apparently,  the element of caring about the customer&apos;s experience is not a priority. Also, if it&apos;s a Saturday night, gameday or another event, expect even worse service. On the last visit to this location, our table was asked to move 3 times because they wanted to clear the area for live music. Planning for such an event should take place long before the customers are seated and eating. If you are sitting at the bar for food or drinks, you&apos;ll want the WiFi password, so you&apos;ll have something to do while waiting. You are likely to have little interaction with the staff, or they will totally ignore you,  like the employee pictured. WiFI password: shamrock","Shared the wings (BBQ and Hot). The BBQ wings were awesome - the Hot I would pass on. Additionally, ordered a Chicken Caesar.  The dressing was a tad tangy - not my favorite dressing but the portion was generous.  The chicken was grilled and a bit chewy but perhaps I ordered wrong considering McGilvra&apos;s is an Irish Pub / sports bar.  The food around us looked pretty good.  Next time I would order a burger / stick with the BBQ wings.  

Great service though and fun spot to watch sports.  Nice patio in the summer time, too.","Absolutely fantastic!! 

Went here on a sunny Monday afternoon around lunch. We were immediately greeted by a very friendly waitress. We later found out she was also the bartender, food runner, and busser! 

When tables started filling up, this amazing woman wasn&apos;t phased in the least! It was impressive to watch her work so diligently. I would have given this place five starts even if the food wasn&apos;t. 

Oh, but it was!!! I had the chicken Caesar salad and almost licked the plate, and my partner had the fish and chips.....which I happily finished for him on account he was full. 

I most definitely will be back!!!","Had happy hour in their patio which has a ok view of Lake Washington.  It was a nice day so my cousin and I sat outside.  Their happy hour includes well drinks, beer and a limited choice of wines.  The appetizers were $5 which was a good deal.  We had the buffalo wings which were really spicy.  Mostly tasted the hot sauce.  The calamari was pretty good as well as the coconut shrimp.  I really liked the Irish nachos, which basically were like house made potato chips with nacho toppings and your choice of meat.  I read some reviews stating that the food was really salty, which kind of worried me, but our food wasn&apos;t.  

Service was good as we were always made sure if we needed anything.  This pub is kid friendly as they allow families to sit out in the patio section, unlike some other establishments.  Not a bad place for happy hour.  I will be back.","Very busy day as it&apos;s the last of the summer sun before fall weather begins to set in. Under staffed, so long wait but foods delicious! Recommended",All day happy hour on Sunday! I absolutely love the outdoor patio and the fact that it&apos;s just a short walk from the beach. They have your typical Irish pub food and do it well. The potato skins were delish :) one of my go-to summer happy hour spots! Dogs also welcome for all the dog lovers out there.,"Poor service, wish I could give it a zero. My friend and I waited forever for the food to arrive. The staff was less than attentive. The girl who dropped the food off was rude. Ruben was greasy and soggy. Fries were cold. We will never be back. This place really doesn&apos;t fit in well with the neighborhood.","Outdoor seating, bottles of PBR and Rainier, Guinness on tap, and tons of TVs for sports...how can you go wrong?! McGilvra&apos;s is the perfect place to have a beer with friends. Its casual, but not quite as &quot;dive bar&quot; as some of the neighboring establishments.  Try the taco salad or the whiskey crab soup in a sourdough bread bowl and leave a happy camper! 

Pros
$3.50 bottles of PBR
Nice outdoor options for the occasional sunny day
Parking is pretty easy

Cons
The menu is large...don&apos;t stray too far from their known dishes.","This is a great spot for delicious take out chinese food. It&apos;s extremely tasty without being too oily and sugary. Great service and a good selection of vegetarian options, including dim sum. 
I will be ordering here regularly.","What a freaking gem! I had no idea they had such an extensive dim sum menu, and it bums me out to think I&apos;ve been driving past it for years. BF and I ordered the following for takeout on the 4th of July--ha gow, siu mai, shrimp &amp; chive dumplings, sticky rice, and eggplant stuffed w/ shrimp. 

They were out of the eggplant stuffed w/ shrimp, but offered a substitute called garlic eggplant. This dish was SUCH a pleasant surprise! The sauce was perfection and super unique--I had never tasted anything like it. The dim sum dishes were fantastic as well, and are definitely on par with those from the ID.

BF &amp; I were both extremely happy with our meal, and are super happy to have a great dim sum option nearby. We&apos;re also planning on a return visit to try their regular menu--their menu is enormous!","They have pivoted to takeout and are taking care to keep us all safe. The food was made to order and delicious.  Green onion pancakes... Yum! I can&apos;t wait until they are able to have sit down since their Dim Sum is really good as well.  Very good food and they are generous with portions, we will have left overs for later.","My favorite little dim sum place in Seattle near Green Lake for lunch Monday thru Friday. Staff are friendly and helpful. Dim sum is made to order, so fresh. 

Families and friends enjoy the weekends with servers circulating the carts filled with many choices.","I live a couple blocks away from this place and have been meaning to try it for over a year now, but only got around to it last night. I really hoped it would be amazing because it would be great to have a local spot to frequent when I&apos;m in the mood for chinese food.  The food was prepared super quickly and was still piping hot long after I brought it home, so that was a big plus! However, I wasn&apos;t super impressed with the food itself.  I ordered the garlic eggplant and the beef chow fun, two of my regular dishes when I get chinese food.  Both were extremely oily, especially the eggplant.  The oil was so excessive that it had spilled out of the container and leaked through the bag, leaving a pool of oil on all of the surfaces it touched.  I did like the flavor, but the amount of oil made it hard to eat a lot of.  The chow fun wasn&apos;t swimming in quite as much oil as the eggplant, but still left a slimy feeling in my mouth.  On top of that, it didn&apos;t really have any flavor.  It wasn&apos;t bad, but was definitely underwhelming.  It did come with a lot of beef though!  The portions that they give are huge, which is really nice, but as it&apos;s hard to get more than a small portion down without feeling weird from all the oil, I&apos;ll probably be eating leftovers for the rest of the week.  I haven&apos;t written this place off completely yet.  I&apos;m still willing to try their dim sum, but I don&apos;t think I would order the things I ordered again.","Oct. 7 , 2019

Ambience. C
Service. A
Food. A
Price. B

Found on edge of green lake. Own property and standalone Bldg. Been here for years. Free lot parking. Or street. 
Overly bright and large dining. Run down and needs a little tlc.  Booths are worn out. Dirty bathrooms. Ugh. 

Service was very friendly and helpful. 
Food is delicious.  My favorite is the Bean curd Rolls. 
Had dim sum and is available all day.  Cooked to order. 
Comes out nice and hot. 

Surprised the pea vines were $15!  But, very tender and delicious. 
Two of us with tip. $52!  That&apos;s a lot for dim sum. Just saying. 

I would only come back if in neighborhood but I&apos;d rather go to chinatown.","One of the best dim sum places and actually a bit cheaper than usual too. 

The Á≥ØÁ±≥È∏° is really moist and sticky. It is one of those dishes where a lot of places don&apos;t cook so well but here is really good. ÂèâÁÉßÈÖ• is surprisingly good. It tastes a bit like ËÇâÊùæ. Not a quite common dish in other Dimsum places as well. 

The service is actually quite amazing. When we walked in, the lady asked me if I want ËÇ†Á≤â, but I asked if they have the shrimp one which they don&apos;t have. Later on, she remembered and actually took it to our table for us. 

Would come back!","My friends and I stopped here between 1 and 2pm on a Saturday. The restaurant is quite spacious, but there was only one or two other parties inside. As a result, there were only two dimsum carts going around. We got chicken feet, pork spare ribs, shu mai, and char-siu buns off the carts and ordered the pea vines and xiao long bao off the menu. 

Overall, we thought the food was very mediocre. The pea vines were good but very, very oily. The shu mai was by far the best the dim sum plate. Plenty of filling and good flavor. The pork spare ribs were a little goopy -- maybe too much cornstarch -- rather than tender. The chicken feet were fine, neither particularly good nor offensive. 

The xiao long bao (soup dumplings) were a little sub par. We each had at least one dumpling which had no soup inside, and that&apos;s 50% of the point of the dumplings. 

I might come back if I have a crazy craving for dim sum purely because of its proximity to my apartment and my extreme laziness, but otherwise, I&apos;d seek out a better alternative for dim sum.","Disappointing, the food was slimy and overcooked. I ordered a bunch to have as left orders but had to toss it :/","Yay, I&apos;m glad to see that others recognize the value of this nieghborhood gem. No, I don&apos;t know either why it has not been held up alongside Judy Fu&apos;s Snappy Dragon, etc. The portions are always large and delicious, more than generous for the price point. Covid caused prices to raise with all restaurants ... I noted that even with the dollar raise Bamboo Village still comes out slightly below average in cost. I order takeout a handful of times a yr, Family Style Plan B with extra cashew chicken or substituting ma po tofu for mu shu pork (which I just never grew to like, at any restaurant, despite trying valiantly) God, the portions and sides for these family style dinners .... so many food items.. Easily enough food for 3 people, perhaps 4. Or leftovers. Their ma po tofu is delicious. I have tried their sesame balls and steamed pork dumplings too, and everything, again, is delicious. Not too greasy or salty. Not too sweet. Lots of extra sauces to choose from. I plan on trying more items in the future, but I will say this restaurant turned me onto cashew chicken. Yum! I will add that the items i&apos;ve tried are mostly americanized chinese food. They do offer more traditional chinese items. Thank you to the owners for being sweet and letting me substitute or add on without fuss. I know that&apos;s a pain but your kindness is noted.",Fantastic Chinese food!! Such great value for the price! The green onion pancake is to die for!!,"We have been neighbors and regulars at Bamboo Village for many years. Early this year the management and kitchen turned over. We are pleased to report that the quality of the food continues to be first rate, even as take-out. 
We send Crystal and her chef our best wishes for success in this time that can be so difficult for family businesses. It makes us happy that whenever we pick up our orders, we see other folks there too. Great! Eat well and keep BV alive!","Decent chinese american fair at a great price! I got one of the combos and it was enough food to last two days.

Spring rolls were particularly yummy.

A great option for a weekend cheat meal!",Surprised that green lake had one Chinese restaurant. It serves dim sum during the morning but after 1 you stop seeing the carts and have to order from the menu. They don&apos;t have duck or much of what you see downtown. So if you are looking for an American style dim sum this may be the place. It&apos;s clean and they do speak english. Parking is free with enough room. The inside is spacious! Big tables with enough room for the carts to go by. With a few things on the menu that really say Chinese dim sum it not all that special.,"Loved this dim sum place. We found it on goop and decided to give it a try. It is a little far, but it&apos;s worth the drive. Their shrimp dumplings were absolutely delicious. The staff was very friendly and the place itself was very quaint with lots of bamboo outside the windows.","We have come here for dinner and lunch on many many occasions. Most of these occasions have all been around weekends or some sort of holiday. Overall the restaurant atmosphere has always been very slow. Usually that is not a good sign, but the food is actually pretty decent. We have tried many of their dishes from dim sum to roasted meats to the claypots and they have all been decent. Their menu is good for those who like Americanized Chinese food and also more traditional food. 

The service has also been pretty decent during outlet visits. They have been accommodating to special requests and have been good and serving larger crowds.","We went in on an empty day,  our table and the tables around us had ants all over on the table and floor, food was only okay. Service was friendly. Will not be returning..","We stopped into the village on a Sunday for brunch following a trip to the zoo. While we didn&apos;t directly correlate seeing a bunch of animals with a desire for dim sum, i&apos;m sure that in the subconscious there was something going on!

The spot is located on Sandpoint Way just down from Green Lake. It&apos;s on a corner and there&apos;s parking for maybe 10 cars in the lot. There&apos;s plenty of street parking however. Getting in can be a bit tricky if you&apos;re coming from the Green Lake side, so just make sure you&apos;re familiar with the best way to call directly in. Google maps is excellent for such information!

Now to the food. These guys serve dim sum every day, and for those of usI don&apos;t have access to dim some of the time, it was glorious! The place has seating for roughly 50 or 60 people and has tons of round tables with Lazy Susan&apos;s in the middle. We&apos;d forgotten how exciting one of these can be to kiddos until our three and five-year-olds found them. The cart ladies descendent quickly and had just about anything we could want. It definitely was not the most impressive dim sum spread but truthfully, there was nothing that we wished was there. We also asked for some fried taro and they went back and made it for us as it wasn&apos;t immediately available.

All in all, a solid spot with good options. Not the fanciest place, but not the jankiest either. They&apos;ll likely have what you&apos;re looking for and the folks working here are lovely! Worth the trip if you&apos;ve got the hankering for dim sum and you&apos;re in the area.",Omg dim sum is amazing.  Odd that no one is here.  Server was nice enough to heat up my dim sum because they were slow but I was in awe with my dim sum.  Thank you!,"We did takeout tonight--and enjoyed very tasty, traditional dishes. The potstickers were very flavorful and deliciously crispy. The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was PERFECTLY cooked, and we appreciated that the sauce was packaged separately so we could add as much or as little as we liked. The generous order of pork fried rice was good, as were the steamed pork buns and General Tsao&apos;s Chicken. Our order was ready when promised (only 20 minutes) and the services was friendly and efficient. We found all portions to be generous, and very reasonably priced.  Wholeheartedly recommend Bamboo Village! Give them your support--they are a wonderful asset to our community!","Super friendly staff. Attentiveness filled with kindness!
Delicious food! Try the stew!!! Try the turkey melt! Go a bunch of times and try it ALL!
Great decor! And so much more! Really good peeps! My brother recommended this place and boy was he right!!!
Love the onion rings!!!!","For some reason we skip over this bar when deciding where to go out but we have been here a few times lately. 

For one, their happy hour is 4-8 everyday and all day on Sunday. Well that&apos;s a great window for happy hour. All their food is half off with a purchase of a beverage. They have PBR for $3, other beers for $5 and my fav is $5 for wine. 

It&apos;s definitely on the divey side but not dirty. It actually kind of takes me back in time to a bar you might see in a movie. They also have been playing oldies the few times we have been in, which I love!

This is a great place to watch sports! They have a few tv&apos;s and also a large projector screen. We were in for the Sounders playoff game and World Series and they were packed with fans. It was pretty fun to hear cheers all around the bar randomly. 

Service is top notch! It&apos;s usually two guys taking orders, making drinks, running food and cashing people out. Super friendly and on top of it! 

This will probably be one of our go to spots this fall/winter b/c it&apos;s close, well priced and super chill/friendly.","Having been to this place a handful of times, I cant say I&apos;ve had a bad experience for a greatly located place like Kate&apos;s! 

For me, the big draw is Trivia on Monday nights! It&apos;s always such a fun and welcoming atmosphere. Teams fill the tables from the very front of the bar to the back wall. Bartenders seem to handle the giant, various crowds pretty well. 

Pool, darts, board games, and sports. Makes a great time for just about any occassion! With the only gripes I&apos;ve experienced being: the beer selection isn&apos;t as wide or tasty as my personal liking. And on one of the random weekday nights my boyfriend and I went, we had to move because of the leaks in the ceiling dripping. I didn&apos;t let it effect my service experince, or make a big deal over-all. I just let the bartender know and continued playing Trivia Pursuit. Just feels like a very fixable and obvious maintenance fundamental of owning a building in Seattle! Lol

Would absolutely recommend all in all, and you can always catch me and my boyfriend playing trivia on trivia night or not!","One of my favorite neighborhood haunts. Everything from the Divey atmosphere, tons of sports playing on multiple screens, the awesome staff, and good food and drinks makes this place a go to stop. 
Can&apos;t beat their happy hour it&apos;s one of the best for sure. From 4 to 8 PM everything on the menu is half off along with drink specials. Also happy hour runs all day Sundays.
Another fun thing about this place is all the boardgames they have in house. Come to watch a game or come to play a game either way you&apos;ll have a good time.
The food is pretty on par here and can&apos;t go wrong with just about anything on the menu. The Philly cheesesteak is probably one of my favorites along with their burgers. Big portions and of course great prices. Definitely recommend stopping by.","Even though dives aren&apos;t normally my thing. I had a fun time chatting with friends and enjoyed the super cheap drinks!

The smallish space was pretty quiet on a Tuesday around 9:30 but some more people trickled in throughout the evening. They have a pool table and darts, plus half-off Tuesdays! 3 vodka sodas came to around $12 after tax and tip. Yes only $12 for 3 drinks! Each drink included a lemon and a lime wedge too which was much appreciated. Everyone working there that I interacted with was friendly and helpful. I tried a few french fries which were decent. Overall the experience was pleasant and I&apos;d come back with zero complaints.","I have literally never left a bad review in my life, but the woman who served us last night was straight awful. I&apos;ve been a server ten years, I know what it&apos;s like to be busy and stressed out, but she was so rude it was almost comical. I still tipped her 20% because I&apos;m NOT rude, but damn. 

The pub itself was cool.",I love Kate&apos;s. Living around the corner has always been a pleasure to be able to walk there with friends and enjoy a great atmosphere.,"I&apos;ve been coming here for 2+ years now. I love the staff that works here. They&apos;re like a second family and always greet us with kindness. They have the best happy hour from 4-8 and we never miss a Monday trivia night! There&apos;s a free shit round in the middle--which is the only thing we&apos;ve ever won  Taylor, Grant, Grace and Kate make this local hang out feel like a second home!!! 11/10 recommend this place. Any night of the week, this place is the move.","I&apos;ve been coming to Kate&apos;s almost every week for a few years now. The staff are friendly, the beer selection is fantastic, and their happy hour prices are unbeatable -- 1/2 off food! Check out Kate&apos;s for a relaxed atmosphere, staff who will remember you after a couple of visits, good beer, and delicious jello shots (when you&apos;re feeling a bit more adventurous). Kate&apos;s is my favorite bar in the neighborhood!","Great pub fare! My friend and I went to get pedicures across the street and then wanted dinner that was nearby and wouldn&apos;t cause us to ruin our pedis by walking. Kate&apos;s Pub has happy hour until super late - 8! I can&apos;t remember the last time I had such a great late happy hour dinner! We have officially decided to make it our monthly pedis and pub girls night location for dinner! Great customer service, TVs, and very good food - what could be better?! See you next month!","Great, friendly place. Good drinks, yummy food and service with big smiles. You feel good coming to Kates Pub.","The happy hour here is LEGIT.

Great beer selection as well as a full bar. The ambiance is fantastic and they have a lot of events (often late night) like live music, karoake, etc.

Half off food is great. The food menu is normal prices so half off is a great deal. We got burgers and enjoyed that we could put whatever we want on it. Additionally, a friend got fish &amp; chips - so big that 2 people couldn&apos;t finish it.

Service was so friendly and helpful.. The whole experience was great. Can&apos;t wait to return.","Real pub, with darts, pool, sports, great drinks, food, and atmosphere. Hospitality from Kate and her staff is always above excellent when my group arrive after soccer on sundays. 

You really don&apos;t need anywhere else.","Best neighborhood bar and happy hour in Seattle. Great owner and staff, good food, and did I mention the best happy hour in Seattle?","Making a handful of friends who are Wallingford locals, they kept raving about this spot and wanting to take me there. Well Saturday, we ended up at Kate&apos;s and it was awesome!

We were driving back from Snoqualmie Falls around 5 pm, and swung by here for a bite to eat. THEIR HAPPY HOUR IS 7 DAYS A WEEK AND GOES FROM 4-8, meaning buy a drink and 1/2 off the menu. Pretty awesome deal if you ask me. 

We ordered:
- pulled pork sandwich with onion rings
- pulled pork mac and cheese
- build your own burger
- cheese fries

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and loved it! I also had a bite of the mac and cheese and that was delicious as well. I am a huge ketchup fan, and they actually carry a line of gourmet ketchup, one free sauce per meal. 

Seems like this bar has a lot to offer, pool tables in back, great food, karaoke nights, great happy hour... the list goes on and on haha.","The happy hour is the GREATEST in the WORLD.  Reduced beverage and food prices.  An atmosphere that&apos;s a mixture of Cheers (TV Show) and the best neighborhood bar that you have ever been to.  Yeah the food isn&apos;t a Michelin Star winner but it&apos;s a Damn Bar.  Bar food should be fried and dripping with grease.  Kate&apos;s doesn&apos;t let you down with your expectations of bar food.  Chip, the owner is one cool guy.  I can&apos;t wait to get back to Seattle and spend all of my money at Kate&apos;s.","I still maintain that Kate&apos;s has the greatest happy hour in the U-district. Can&apos;t beat the $5 well drinks to get food items at half off. The food isn&apos;t the greatest but coming in at around $4-$7 a plate during happy hour, it shouldn&apos;t have to be outstanding. The nachos and the quesadilla are always pretty good and the fish and chips is a great deal for the price. I have enjoyed coming here on a regular basis until recently, which is why I&apos;m updating my review and knocking Kate&apos;s down to 2 stars.

The last couple of times I&apos;ve been to Happy Hour on Tuesday (and Tuesday nights are also half-priced nights!), and the server working (always wears shorts, a bandanna and has long gray hair) has been downright rude and borderline racist. The first time my group and I thought it was a fluke deal (we&apos;re in school and all work service jobs to get by so understand the particular challenges that come with dealing with the public) but the second time it was obvious that this guy thinks he&apos;s better than everyone and is totally demeaning towards anyone who is not a regular, or who does not know what they want to drink the second they walk in the door (because that&apos;s how long he gives you to make a choice), or who is of a different race/ethnicity.

Love the bar, the vibe and the happy hour pricing, but will definitely not be back any time this particular server is working. I have had nothing but great interactions with all other staff, and have never encountered a female bartender/server as mentioned in some of the other reviews.","We stopped in on a whim and had a great time.  Excellent prices, friendly staff, fun place!","Great food, best happy hour in town. Can get pretty busy but it&apos;s a popular spot so it&apos;s no surprise.","Kati and her crew always treat us amazingly! There&apos;s no other place in the city I&apos;d rather watch Timbers games at, and the beer selection is always great.","I really don&apos;t know how the bartender does it all.
Extremely warm and inviting atmosphere with amazing attendance and attention from the staff. We felt like we were always looked after when the whole place was pretty full. I don&apos;t know how he does it all?! 

The drinks were fun and made well with some bar food options such as burgers and sides. They place the extras of the meal on the side so you can pick and choose what you want in them. 

The layout of the establishment was well done; roomy and easy to be served and attended to. 
I came here as a newbie worried about what I&apos;d find. I couldn&apos;t be more happy and easily comforted as the bartender filled the air with his energy and amazing service. Thank you!","We absolutely love this bar. It&apos;s such a gem nestled in the greenlake neighborhood. It kind of feels like the &quot;Cheers&quot; concept where everybody loves you and everybody knows your name. No one is a stranger in this bar as everyone is so friendly. The drinks are always rotating and the food is phenomenal. We had the wings with blue cheese dipping sauce (WOW, i hate wings and loved these). I had the mushroom Swiss burger with a side salad. Both were fresh and delicious. Highly recommend coming here to watch a sports game or just unwind after a long day of work. You have to be fun loving and in a good mood - everyone here is trying to have a good time.",Typical bar food. Not the most amazing thing but pretty satisfying. They are definitely a sports bar with a lot of tvs and great beer selection. Allez Liverpool,"Went here to watch the Seahawks game and was super excited to have such a chill bar to do so. That being said, throughout my stay there- I felt incredibly unsafe in terms of Covid19. There was no enforcement of mask wearing, and even the bartenders were sometimes not wearing them. There was no enforcement of social distancing, tables were close together, and people were getting very close to one another seemingly un-phased. Under normal circumstances this would sound like a ridiculous complaint, but during a pandemic... I&apos;d say that is a huge safety concern. I hope that changes can be made to make this bar safer, but until that happens I would not recommend anyone go here.","Great place to come and watch the Florida Gators play!! Nice selection of draft beers, good bar food and friendly service. The wings are amazing and so are the burgers!","This is a very nice neighborhood bar. The bartenders are friendly and fairly efficient and the food is good. More importantly, even though I was there for the first time and it was clear that many of the patrons were regulars, I didn&apos;t feel like stranger.

There&apos;s plenty of room (they even have an annex space for private parties) and except on a game day or special event, the bar and dining area is relatively quiet and very comfortable.

I ordered the fish-n-chips with a pint from the rotating tap and my companion enjoyed a salmon sandwich. They didn&apos;t have a cider option, so my companion ordered a club soda.

It&apos;s also worth noting that the bar features a wide variety of premium whiskey and single malt scotch favorites.","I live just a few blocks away and really wanted to make this my local pub but I have been in a few times now and the service has been terrible each time. The first time we (group of 4) waited 10 minutes for a server(there were other people there but if wasn&apos;t what I&apos;d call busy). When we finally got one it took 10 more minutes to get our drinks. We ordered food and a half hour later it hadn&apos;t come. We flagged someone down and turns out they forgot to put in our food order (?). Ok. Not a great first trip but things happen right? 
A month later we come in again and the same thing with the server. Waited 10 minutes for someone to greet us and give us menus. Asked for a Scotch list and they didn&apos;t have one (!!!?). This place bills itself as a great place for Scotch. Asked for a recommendation and the server said he wasn&apos;t a Scotch guy. Again wtf, you&apos;re a Scotch bar. They didn&apos;t forget to put in our food order this time but each time we needed fresh drinks we had to flag someone down and had to flag someone down for the check. Food is fine and standard bar fare but the service here downright sucks. Wanted to love this place and come in often. Now I won&apos;t be back.","This is my new favorite Greenlake bar! The perfect vibe, cozy and warm, airy and chill. I had one of the best old fashioneds here I&apos;ve ever tasted (well, I had two of them.) Their tartar sauce really is off the charts, and the steak salad was surprisingly substantial and way more tasty than I thought it would be. Basic bar food it is not - it was well balanced and well dressed and just delicious. Average prices for the area, but above average for everything else. Can&apos;t wait to go back and try the wings!","Gotta love the Sounder fans leaving reviews who want to take up table space, order waters and split a basket of fries. I&apos;ve seen it, and here they complain for having to pay up front for a meal, and drink, at a discount like the rest of us. This bar is great! Inexpensive wide selections of beers on tap, full bar that pours great drinks and the best wings around. The pastrami sandwich is my favorite and I drive back to the old neighborhood to have one and see the friendly staff regularly. Great food, service, and beverages-they hit the trifecta!","We were really excited to watch a Sounders match Sunday night, as we&apos;ve enjoyed watching many matches here in the past. The bartender had no mask on, but we thought that would change once we sat down. Nope. Upon ordering a couple of beers and reviewing the menu, we noticed that the cook wasn&apos;t wearing a mask either! To make matters worse, he had no gloves on and we saw him play on his phone more than once while he cook a few curbside orders. We quickly headed out and watched the match at home. This experience has made us concerned about their overall hygiene...even after the pandemic is over. Too bad since there aren&apos;t many great soccer bars around...","Stopped in here for booze and a burger.  Definitely worth checking out for its extensive scotch collection.  

Pros:
-Good selection of draft beers and especially scotch
-Solid food at reasonable prices ($11 for a good burger in my case)
-Friendly and attentive service

Cons:
-No happy hour, which is almost unbelievable to me given that it is a bar and pretty much all other nearby bars have some sort of early and/or late happy hour
-Really uncomfortable ambiance.  I came on a weekday, and the place clearly had its regulars since I was the only person at the bar throughout my time there who did not know everyone else.  That was not a problem, but the conversations on either side of me were really loud (like some of the loudest I have ever heard in a bar) and were chock-full of expletives (specifically f-bombs, which occurred at least every ten seconds), which went unaddressed by the staff (who also knew everyone but me).  It was quite unpleasant.  The restaurant can obviously decide who its intended customers are, but it was clear that I was not one of them (which is fine).","Another terrible bar for the area. I lived in the north end of greenlake and decided to try this place after shopping at pcc. I ordered a shot of Jameson with a coke back and 5 years ago, sugary drinks weren&apos;t taxed as they are now. I was charged for a soda not even full or with ice with my meager shot for $10.","I live down the street from this spot and always figured it was your standard sports bar so hadn&apos;t ventured in. However, Frank &amp; I have been trying to check out new (to us) local spots and decided to check them out for happy hour on a Friday evening. We arrived just past 5pm, it was pretty quiet (started picking up considerably around 7 when more games started). I surprised myself with how much I liked this place! It&apos;s actually quite nice inside, lots of warm finished wood accents and just a generally chill and welcoming atmosphere. We split the hummus plate and had cider (me) and beer (Frank) and really enjoyed all of it. Looking forward to coming back and trying more food next time, but I think this is our new go-to local bar for a low-key night!

One thing to note: they don&apos;t offer any happy hour specials, but everything is affordable so it doesn&apos;t matter too much.","Good beers, good food! 

I liked this place. The beers were excellent, they had some great Scottish and English beers on tap which you don&apos;t find super often. 

I had the pastrami on rye. It was really good. The sandwich had a lot of pastrami on the sandwich. It came with fries which were really good as well. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food. 

This is also a great spot to watch sports as well with multiple TVs with different sports on. 

I would recommend a stop by!","Im a transplant from Colorado. And this is a Denver Broncos bar. We have a separate room that we meet in for All Broncos games. The beers are reasonable and they have a suitable list. And the Cheesesteaks on the menu are delicious. The Service is great and they have a nice outside area. Parking is limited and do not park in the Whole Foods lot, you will get towed. Parking in the Neighborhood has never been a problem.","This is a soccer bar. It&apos;s where you go to watch soccer. While you&apos;re here, enjoy the Guinness, which is    carbonated with nitrogen and served at a proper temperature. Also, enjoy barbacoa tacos that rival any first rate taco truck. Or a burger that is cooked to perfection and served with a friend egg so precisely cooked you&apos;ll take pitty on the line cook being over managed by the kitchen manager 

The service is great, the food is way above expectations for a typical sports pub, and the beer is proper. Enjoy the match!",THE BEST BRONCO BAR! Moved to Seattle from Denver and this is the place to be. The owners are so so friendly. The food is great and comes out quick. We always feel so welcomed and part of the community here :),"This place is a gem. The perfect place to relax on a summer evening. Great beer, great food, friendly staff, and a great patio. Will definitely keep coming back.","Scotch lovers would love this place.  They have a separate menu with all of their scotches listed.  My friends loved their scotch selection.

I had their Scottish bbq sandwich, which was salty and sweet with decent beef brisket slices, but it wasn&apos;t any different from other bbq places I&apos;ve been to.  They offered and good amount of fries with it as well.

Decent food, excellent selection of scotch.  Nuff said.","Love the verde nachos, the wings and fries. Great food, beer and drink selections. Best part is the outside patio dedicated to sports fan. Good place to chill, have a few drinks and food.","WOW I AM IMPRESSED! This place is such a hidden treasure! How have I never been here?  

SO the Mountaineering Club is located on the top floor of &quot;The Graduate&quot; hotel in the University District.  I will also be reviewing the hotel separately.  

The restaurant is located on the top floor of the building and offers a rooftop terrace as well as indoor dining.  The entire atmosphere is super cozy and quaint which follows the boutique theme for the hotel.  At first glance the food menu seemed a little basic however that&apos;s because they name the items in a &quot;mountaineer&quot; theme.  Confused? Let me explain. For example, I ordered the &quot;Mountain Bacon Sandwich&quot; which I initially envisioned as a BLT...boy was I wrong.  The sandwich is piled high with THICK and I mean THICK pieces of smoky bacon which is basically a smoked Pork sandwich, however to follow the theme you get Bacon sandwich. Follow me?  Anyway I digress, the morale of the story is the food is BOMB and the Drinks, OH MAN the drinks are equally as delicious. The service was great and the ambiance was very warm and inviting.  You are in for a treat.  ENJOY!  

Oh and TIP.  They always &quot;require&quot; reservations but on weekdays you can basically walk in and they&apos;ll be cool with that.  However on weekends you are out of luck. You will almost ALWAYS need a reservation.

Cheers","I was originally salty because I had booked a reservation while the restaurant was closed (unannounced on the website) when I complained about it someone from the restaurant immediately reached out to apologize and explain the circumstances along with giving me a hefty gift card. Upon them re-opening I made a reservation to use the gift card and was blown away. 10 out of 10 ambience, staff incredibly friendly, cocktails brilliantly crafted and executed (unlike anything we had ever had before). Low and behold we spent the gift card and then some. Would like to personally shout out Steven the food and beverage director for us wanting to give the place a second try as it did not disappoint. We will come back for sure !","This one is a tricky spot to rate because on the one hand, the view and ambiance is SO incredible!! 360¬∫ views of the Seattle area including Rainier, the Space Needle, downtown, the UW campus, and mountains to the east and west. The decor is also very cool and has a sort of Wes Anderson vibe which I loved. We sat outside with a prime corner spot facing where Rainier would have been (she was hiding in clouds that particular day), and they even had an overhead heater which was great since the wind was strong and cold up there - we came prepared with warm coats too, knowing we&apos;d be outside. We learned if you want an outdoor fireplace spot, you have to request it in your reservation comments (tip for next time) but we were still really happy with our spot. They have big doors along the indoor space that are open, at least when we were there, making it feel safe from a COVID perspective both inside and out.

The staff was friendly and accommodating, especially the host. However, my expectations were super high from all of the above (and even having seen pictures of the cocktails) but I&apos;m sad to report the cocktails were sub-par. They were very beautiful and fun to look at but it felt like a &quot;learn the rules before you break them&quot; type of moment in terms of the flavors. They were either interesting but not tasty, or just downright bad IMO. I am usually pretty easy to please when it comes to cocktails and I didn&apos;t even want to drink mine once I tasted it. We got 4 different snacks to share, and the food was pricey for what felt like stuff I could have thrown together at home (store bought crackers, sliced cucumbers and the hummus looked like it had already been half eaten when it arrived due to the amount we received and how it was presented.) Taste of the food at least was good, but nothing impressive, again, considering the price. One other small gripe was there was no hook in the toilet stalls to hang your coat or purse, which was a bit icky.

The biggest thing for me was that the food and drinks were disappointing, which is a shame because everything else about this place is so amazing. I&apos;d come back more as a local if they improved their food and beverage game; but for now, I plan to bring out-of-towners when I have guests visiting for the experience/views and a single cocktail, but that&apos;s about it, and I&apos;ll definitely be ordering a classic cocktail, not something off of their menu.","If you are staying at the Graduate Hotel, you will likely end up at the Mountaineering Club by default. There is a dedicated elevator to access the rooftop establishment at the lobby level, supervised by a staff member who will check your ID and who may be amusingly nonplussed by your presence, but no matter, this is not Studio 54. Upon arriving in the rather tiny and darkly-lit bar/dining area, we were asked if we had made reservations, which for a hotel bar seemed a bit odd, but we still found seats right away at a high top table.

Service involved a bit of a chase--requiring us to physically track down our person to order, and then again for the bill. The cocktails themselves have been creatively designed and named by the resident mixologist. I tried the &quot;Not Coming Home Tonight&quot; ($13), a sweet tall drink with gin, lemon, bitters, and raspberry lambic (a new and happy discovery for me, with its intense berry brightness). I loved the crushed ice that held it all together, but the addition of the candied fennel seeds poured on top was too gimmicky and made for a texturally strange and overly sweet experience. 

I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d go out of my way to visit this spot, but as a spontaneous place to grab a drink while staying at the Graduate, it served its purpose.","I came for a nice evening with my friend after she told me about the views! I definitely was impressed with the ambience and environment, but the drinks and food were not my favorite.

Golden Hot Cocoa 2/5: I was expecting hot chocolate with a taste of alcohol, and it was presented in a very cute mug but I only tasted the alcohol and some chalky chocolate? taste. I had a little under half of it, and really couldn&apos;t finish it because it wasn&apos;t great. I think I would have just preferred regular hot chocolate.

Truffle Mac n Cheese 3.5/5: This was definitely better than the drink, and it wasn&apos;t too expensive. It just wasn&apos;t my favorite Mac n cheese; the flavors were good and I liked the crunchy topping, it just lacked sauce and cheesiness. 

Also, I wasn&apos;t a fan of the auto 20% tip they placed on the bill. I definitely thought the service was good, but wish they would have left it up to me. Maybe I&apos;ll come back for the view... I&apos;ll just order another food item and no drink.","Came here on Sunday Nov 1st for my bday celebration. The view is amazing, ill give that a star. I requested a special spot indoor but since we wanted to go see the view more they were nice to put us where we wanted. Another star for that. Drinks are okay but a little pricey. And what disappointed me was our food. We waited for a while,  then our food came cold and raw!! Instead of giving us new and cook food, they offered us smores for dessert. I wish I took a picture of our receipts. Two of my friends split the bill and they also took the tip automatically which was $35 each. So the tip was over $60. I was planning to come here with my husband on our 3 years anniversary, but not anymore.","Is it just me, or is The Mountaineering Club not as talked about as I thought? 

We went on a weekday, and still... This place was bustling! I&apos;m guessing most of them were hotel guests because it was earlier in the day. I&apos;m just surprised they don&apos;t have hundreds of reviews yet. ;) 

My fiance and I stopped by Mountaineering Club to meet a friend for a drink. Prices were fair during happy hour with Rainiers being $4. For this sort of establishment, that&apos;s pretty cheap! 

The views are phenomenal. You get borderline 360 views and I&apos;m sure on nice days, this place is poppin&apos;! Right as we sat down outside, it started sprinkling so we moved in. 

The inside is casual but super cool, so we were perfectly comfortable to sit and talk in there.

100% I recommend for the views. I would come back JUST for a sunset photo. Come for a drink just to treat yourself to that!","The views and ambiance/decor were really what made this place nice. The food was not good, especially for the price. We ordered a shrimp cocktail and it didn&apos;t come with the traditional cocktail sauce. Instead, it was some Mayo-based sauce which was not a good pairing at all for the shrimp. They also didn&apos;t have quite a few menu offerings available because they &quot;ran out.&quot; Including on some of their signature cocktails. When I asked if they could make a cocktail omitting the ingredient they were out of, they said they couldn&apos;t because all the cocktails were pre-made. Probably won&apos;t be coming back as a local, but the views were nice.","Beautiful views of the Space Needle and downtown Seattle, Mountaineering Club sunsets are not to be missed, but sadly cocktails are underwhelming despite a promising, if ambitious list of house cocktails. While cocktails were presented beautifully, they were overly sweet, lacked balance and limited in format - nearly half were highballs. Few of the cocktails were available up, possibly due to limited barware. Bar staff was hit-or-miss, some with major attitude. Luckily we ended with a nice server who salvaged an otherwise B experience. Passed on the wagyu hot dog and opted for the Tims Chip Pie, which was served in a potato chip bag - cute but no cigar.",Really chill and cozy although if you want a table you will definitely need to reserve in advance (at least on a weekend). Drinks are fine (and unique) and the staff are all super nice + helpful. View is great although it&apos;s super cold when neither the fireplace nor the outside heater is on. S&apos;mores were fun and hopefully I can come back and try the food!,"Love this place! I&apos;ve stayed at Hotel Deca before but never would I have assumed the views from the rooftop patio. It&apos;s absolutely breathtaking and a must see. 

They serve drinks and light bites. I haven&apos;t tried any of the food since I came after the Bite of Seattle but the drinks are great- service is amazing here. I recommend the Orange Snack drink and if you like licorice, the Not Coming Home drink as well. Libations are really reasonably priced. 

There&apos;s outdoor and indoor bar seating. You can make reservations ahead of time for a group seating but otherwise tables/benches outside are first come first serve around the perimeter.

Will definitely come back on another beautiful sunny day in Seattle.","Who knew that there was such a gem in the U-District? Located just a block off The Ave, I dare say The Mountaineering Club has THE BEST VIEWS of the mountains and city. 

This new rooftop bar opened just a couple of weeks ago on the top floor of Graduate Hotel. I definitely recommend checking it out before it becomes more well-known -- it was already quite crowded! Luckily we arrived right after it opened at 3 PM and there was still some seating available. (Reservations are accepted for indoor seats; outdoor seats are first-come first-served.) 

When you arrive, you&apos;ll need to show your ID (21+ only) to a staff member who will buzz you up the elevator. We were greeted immediately after exiting the elevator. The bar has a swanky-yet-casual feeling, aided by the somewhat rustic/eclectic interior design.

By 4 PM, the bar was very crowded and lively. The staff was all very cordial and friendly. However, service at our table outside was extremely slow, since the poor servers were totally slammed. Even the outside tables have servers, which is nice but lead to very late drinks. The biggest issue we had was trying to check out -- we asked for the bill at 4:30 PM, and despite asking multiple times, we weren&apos;t able to pay and leave until 5:30 PM! A whole hour of just trying to pay and leave. 

However, the view is absolutely stunning. When we went on an unusually warm March Tuesday, we were able to see the Space Needle, Mt. Rainier, and all the way to Mt. Baker.","Came here in the summer a couple times- the view is beautiful.

The drinks are pretty expensive and there&apos;s usually little seating because it gets pretty busy. It&apos;s nice to just go grab a drink but not the best place to go with a group.","This is always my first and best stop anytime I visit the city. The atmosphere is incredibly welcoming, they have an entire wrap-around deck with views of the whole city, and the service is second to none. 

Maya has been my server both times I&apos;ve been in and has made my experience here unrivaled by any bar/lounge in Seattle. She&apos;s friendly, personable, and accommodating! I look forward to anytime I get to sit in her section!","The view from this rooftop bar is truly spectacular.  It is an especially nice place to watch the sun setting, with downtown Seattle, the Space Needle, and Mount Rainier silhouetted in the background.  The scene is a little too tres chic to take seriously.  You are required to have reservations if you want to be seated inside.  If you don&apos;t have reservations, you can try to snag a seat at the small bar area or you will need to sit outside.  So, consider the weather and dress accordingly.  Even though I felt the reservation thing was an attempt to make this place seem cooler than it actually is, overall it was a nice place to enjoy a drink with a view.  I didn&apos;t try the food, but it seemed overpriced.  The drinks were reasonably priced.","The decor, ambiance, and the view gave me high expectations that this place was a unique cocktail bar. The drinks are below subpar; my white wine that I ordered had stuff sitting at the bottom of the glass (what the heck is that?) and my friends who got the &quot;snow cone&quot; said that the drinks tasted terrible. One of my friend&apos;s snow cone had purple glitter in it. Though edible, that was so strange and looked like a little kid just decided to throw some glitter in a drink.

Service is attentive. I would recommend they up their drink game. I wouldn&apos;t come back.","So glad that there is an actually nice cocktail bar in this part of town now! The views from the patio are great. The patio is also extensive and almost wraps all the way around so you can look out in multiple directions. It would be nice to have some heat lamps or some fire pits outside, but for now they have provided blankets. 

The vibe is a bit reminiscent of the Nest (with the elevator and the dim atmosphere), but the food and drink menu is much more reasonable. 

We unfortunately did not like our drinks that much (Palouse is Loose, and a Manhattan), but I still look forward to coming back and trying the food and some of the other cocktails.

We decided to stop by Saturday later in the evening just to check it out. I noticed a couple of tables had &quot;reserved&quot; signs on them so they must do reservations. It was fairly busy, but had no trouble getting in or ordering drinks. The only thing is they were out of hot cocktails by the time we arrived.","Fun spot to meet for drinks with friends. However, seating/space is limited so recommend putting in a reservation - especially if you&apos;ve got a group with you in the winter. The view is incredible with almost a 360 degree view from the outside patio. The atmosphere is a fun play on the woods, nature, hiking, skiing, and pretty much everything flannel. The Club sits at the top of the Graduate Hotel, which also boasts some cool decor and music. The prices of the drinks/food are standard Seattle pricing, although, some of the meal/snack options are a little lack luster in flavor and serving size. But you&apos;re really not there for a meal, but more like a chic northwest themed cocktail that includes an ingredient called &quot;mountain essence&quot;. Its a cozy and posh bar with beanie adorned waitstaff and a hip DJ in the back corner pumping out vibes. TMC is one of the cooler rooftop bars in Seattle","This place had my hopes up. I&apos;m not going to lie. This very trendy, cool view bar is something neat to see. so I recommend give it a go. 

I don&apos;t love trying to get the elevator, the food is meh at best but the cocktails are pretty good.

Bottom line...if you get here early enough to get a seat AND you aren&apos;t hungry enjoy. The views are incredible. But if you are hungry... good luck!","My friend Jackson and I have had the best time at this place , the view is gorgeous and out bartender Maya has been the absolute best. It was a bust night so we thought service was gonna suck but maya was such a sweetheart. Having such a a great time!","Great beer, great service and some of the best damned meatballs I have ever eaten! Looking forward to a post COVID visit!","Just here to say I love this place and they&apos;re doing an amazing job handling COVID. Their outdoor dining setup is ideal. Most if not all tables are under cover, tables are well spaced out, and tents are open at two sides to allow for actual airflow. Our table had its own little space heater which kept us very comfortable. The beer and the pizza are always amazing and we loved the Detroit style squares. The broccolini side is a sleeper hit - my three new favorite words are &quot;smoked anchovy butter.&quot; All in all I felt like I could actually relax and enjoy being out of the house for a couple of hours. The setup is comfortable without sacrificing safety, and the service was amazing as always.","We broke our COVID-19 &quot;fast&quot; here -- walked by and saw that outdoor seating was available. (How strange! To eat! At an actual restaurant!). They had a limited menu available written on a blackboard, which worked just fine for us. We ordered the mushroom pizza which was very good (garlicy, thin crust, dollops of ricotta? Anyway, I really enjoyed it). Mike&apos;s only comment was that he wished there were more mushrooms on the pizza, but that&apos;s nitpicky. It was good pizza. I also ordered wine and he had a beer. Service was friendly and quick.","We came here for the outdoor seating which was under a tent and had heat lamps. It was a cool atmosphere with great service. 

We got the hot coppa pizza which was delicious. Crispy thin crust with a slight burnt tang, tasty onions and hot salami. Overall a great pizza. The selection is a bit limited with only a few pizzas on the menu. The focaccia side was good too, but tasted more like thick crispy bread. The pickled vegetables gave us something to munch on but were a bit bland. 

The pricing was pretty high for most things including the beers. A few of the beers on draft were served in wine glasses but still cost $8. Great beer selection though for cans/bottles. 

Overall we had a great time. I&apos;m curious to see how things change then they move seating to indoors.","I&apos;ve heard about the pizza being the best so I came  by to check it out.  It was pretty good and the highlight is they have some unique canned beers on their menu.   I ended up drinking 2-3 CZAF Czechoslovakia pilsner beers that I really enjoyed.  The service was top notch and I would definitely come by here for lunch or to meet some friends for beers.  They have a special price for beers if you get the bucket of beers. So, if you drink 2 or more beers definitely get the bucket.",I really enjoy this place. The food is great and their beer selection is fantastic. The only issue is that the price on everything i g is about 40% too high. I&apos;d love to come here more often but if I leave feeling full it&apos;s easily $100.,"This place is so good. You must get their meatballs, the sauce is to die for. I ordered the meatball pizza and it was delish. I used the left over sauce from the meatballs and put it on the pizza. Their service is great there is very limited parking. I also tried their pink slushie which has rose and other delicious ingredients. 

For dessert I tried their Mexican molten cake, it was amazing. I wish it had more cake than the chocolate filing. But i highly recommend it.

Their decor is also very pretty. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. When you come in you see a lot of tomato sauce cans on a shelf. I hope they are for sale and I hope it&apos;s the same sauce they use for their meatballs. They also have a great beer and alcohol selection.","THANK YOU MASONRY FOR ADDING VEGAN CHEESE.
I have always been a fan of both Queen Anne and Fremont Masonry locations. I don&apos;t do dairy so i typically go for the marinara pie (which is fantastic), but now the Fremont location has added the option of using one of the best vegan cheeses (Violife).  I recently tried the seasonal Harvest Pie with squash, Violife cheese, cranberriers, walnut, and sage. What a perfect winter pizza, and as always the wood fire oven bakes it to perfection. 
Beer selection is consistently on point.  Follow the instagram for updates, new releases, and tap take overs.",Go for the Detroit squares! Check out their Instagram every Sunday for the special Detroit square menu. So good! Like the best focaccia you&apos;ve ever had with thick cheese and great sauce.,"They have a really nice collection of eccentric and unusual craft beers: for a cost. The drafts will run you $7-10+ each with most of them being closer to the $10 side, and many of them being 6oz or 250ml (roughly 8oz) pours. That said, many of them are rare, unusual, or special releases, so if you have the money and you&apos;re into that kind of thing, it&apos;s probably worth it. They also have a nice collection of mostly 750ml (some 375) bottles, starting at $25ish and going up from there. I think if I wanted to come here more frequently, I would probably come with 1 or 2 other people and split a bottle for the least unaffordable and still very delicious option.

I did not try the food as looking at other people&apos;s tables, it looked rather mediocre, and looking at the menu, it looked even more overpriced than the beer (which was expensive but at least quasijustifiable based on interesting-ness). $20 for a small, sad-looking pizza; $25 for an okay-looking but not at all large charcuterie plate. No thanks.

Overall, work on the pricing and I&apos;d consider coming more often.","Fremont Brewery was packed, so we ended up here due to a large selection of beer and good looking appetizers and of course, seating. We sat outside on a beautiful sunny Seattle afternoon which was quite enjoyable.

I ordered a delightful but slightly funky Porter that I enjoyed and we relaxed with a group of friends. We also ordered some of the Focaccia Bread to share which I thought was excellent. We weren&apos;t too hungry so we didn&apos;t order entrees, but we definitely would have if we were hungrier. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the Masonry. They have a great selection of beers and food and I enjoyed the outdoor seating. Service was also very good.","This place was so disappointing- which is so unfortunate considering their location and good beer selection!

We started with a Caesar salad, which had pretty good flavor, but was really overdressed. The most disappointing part was the pizza though. We tried the mushroom and prosciutto with arugula and it was probably one of the worst pizzas I&apos;ve ever had. There were barely any mushrooms on it and the crust was super bland and dry with almost zero cheese. We asked for olive oil or something to dip it in due to the dryness and they even charged us for it. 

I will not be back!","Stopped in on a Friday night and it wasn&apos;t super busy which was nice. The menu calls out that items come out as ready and it was true which meant our pizza got cold while we were eating our salad. It was good but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was still fresh and hot. 

The beet salad was good! Plenty of beets and the cheese on it was really good. They also had a decent selection of lower priced bottles of wine which was nice. 

I&apos;d definitely eat there again but would just wait until  I was done with my salad to order the pizza.","This is an okay place to come learn about the fancy beers the world has to offer. On the other hand, it is an absolutely amazing place to come enjoy such beers if you already know quite a bit about them. 

Let me be clear: These people are super nice, and everything about the place is welcoming. There&apos;s nothing geeky about the vibe. You notice the geekiness when you go through the menu and see all the crazy selections you can get. Beers from all over! Usually lots of funky stuff; some very acidic beers, some spontaneously fermented, and so on. You can get refreshing IPAs and lagers, too. No problem there. But to get the maximum effect at The Masonry, you need to love beers from off the beaten path, and it helps if you love them before you walk in the door. 

That&apos;s what takes this from being a good place to a truly great place. 

There&apos;s a bit of parking, but this is Fremont. Maybe you should walk, or hail a ride. You can barhop. Go ahead--make a weekend of it. Make a week of it. Work won&apos;t care. 

There is a medium-sized dining room with big heavy picnic tables, some patio seating with more sturdy furniture, and some space in back behind the enormous bar. Plenty of stools at the enormous bar, too. Go sit. 

The menu is legit. Everything is good; it shows not only a solid foundation of culinary principles but real creativity, too. There are only so many items and they only change so much, but I&apos;ve loved every meatball, clam, pizza, gnocchi, and everything else I&apos;ve had from here. It&apos;s not all heavy pub grub, either--you can find light stuff for dining al fresco when the weather&apos;s nice. The pizza is fairly light; the crust is thin enough to be crackery but holds just a hint of chewiness. If you can imagine a cartoon where somebody&apos;s trying to finish talking but they can&apos;t because someone keeps handing them slices of pizza, it&apos;s probably Masonry pizza. You think you&apos;re done but then that slice is still open and chomp chomp chomp and oh that one chomp chomp chomp oh god. 

The beer, though. They drive all over the country cultivating relationships with the most interesting breweries. They pull a mobile pizza oven hundreds of miles to participate in festivals. They go visit just to hang out and drink beer, too. People remember them, and those people send them kegs and bottles no one else gets. Seattle beer geeks reap the benefits of the Masonry&apos;s hard work.

I like everything about this place, including the fact that some non-beer people seem to want to go elsewhere. If fewer people are ordering the weird beers I want, so much the better for me. I still want the kegs to sell, of course, but I hate seeing someone order an unusual and wonderful beer, only to dislike it and send it back to be poured out. They get the loveliest beers here, and every drop of all of those beers belongs in humans. Cheers.",This was AMAZING. Sue was the most awesome bartender/server. I highly recommend requesting her. Beer list was epic. Food was wonderful. Service was excellent. Really really enjoyed it. Thank you Sue!!!!!!!!,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. When I lived in Queen Anne, I would go almost weekly. Happy that they have expanded - one of the best beer selections, and some of the best pizza!","Fantastic pizza with perfectly cooked crust, super tasty Caesar salad and a far above average beer selection. Awesome for anyone in to craft beer. We&apos;ll be back sooner than later!","The pizza here is fantastic no doubt, but overall, the Masonry gets the best beer in Seattle.

1) they have a relationship with the Shelton Brothers. The Shelton Brothers are a really big deal (Cantillon).

2) pro - tip always be on the look out for their instagram. you will see events where they will have Cellarmaker, or other top breweries.","Glad to have the Masonry open in Fremont!  The space is absolutely beautiful with tall ceilings and bench style seating.  There is also outdoor patio seating and a fire bar top table.

We care in and tried the pizza, meatballs, and pickles.  The sausage pizza was a good size to split amongst 2 people and had a delicious crispy yet flaky crust, $17.  The half size portion meatballs came with 2 meatballs.  The meatballs were delicious if not a little pricey at $6.  The jar of pickles had a variety of veggies and was delicious.

There was a wide selection of beers including numerous sour beers.  

We plan on coming back soon!","Large beer and wine selection with a tight food menu is a recipe for a great meal.

I am pretty sure the owners conceived this place as a hipster bar that serves food. It&apos;s got a clean, simple feel with long wood tables for groups (plus some pinball and skellball in the back).

The draft beer was very long which is nice because the pretentious descriptions were turning me off all but one. (Seriously who wants a beer with a hint of Bubblegum? And even if it does taste like that, why is decribe it like that when &quot;hint&quot; means it has some other dominant flavor you can use to describe it?) If what is on draft doesn&apos;t sound good, they have can and bottle beers that take up another long column. Plus, a wide selection of wines and cocktails. The drinks take up 2 sides of some very long menus.

The food is much simpler and with a single small pages. They have pizzas, sandwiches, deserts and appetizers that have just a few choices for each category. The menu designs knows to keep it simple with really good dishes. The pizza was amazing. The clams were perfect. The ceasar salad was kind of art. The sandwichea looks amazing. They clearly know good food.","Pros: Good prices and decent bar food (recently stepped up in spring of 2020). Tons of TVs. Arguably the best location to watch a football game in Fremont. Lots of energy. Great, outdoor seating with TVs. 

Cons: Can be pretty busy. Food isn&apos;t amazing, but decent. Service is mediocre unless you&apos;re going straight up to the bar (which is now the only option with COVID, sooooo)...

Pro/Con: Lots of younguns. Early 30s, and I&apos;ve gotta get into the post-college headspace to hit this bar. Can be a plus or minus depending on your perspective.","Fun place! I came here to watch a football game and the vibe is fun and the building looks good. They are doing a good job of distancing people during Covid. The drinks I had were good but probably not out of the ordinary. 
The only con was that it was a little busy so service wasn&apos;t always as fast or attentive as it could be. Overall, a great spot.","Just came here with some friends to watch the fight on tv! Their patio is open, full bar, and their kitchen is open as well for folks to dine in. The bar food here is SOLID and so is their HH menu. The bartenders provide super quick service. Come here if you want some good vibes, sports, and great service first thing out of quarantine! I also feel safe dining here since the servers are all wearing masks and the tables are constantly wiped down.","Food was really great but our service was kind of spotty. I think they only had bar tenders taking orders at the tables so it moved slow but they had all the sports games on and gave our dog treats, which was awesome.","Jack 
Came through with beers and food at his fine establishment. The beers and food were nothing short of excellence. The atmosphere was glorious with plenty of games going . Nothing but top notch service from this place and all employees were very friendly. Please take the time for a cold one or even there great food .","Those of you who read my reviews know I RARELY hand out five stars. And, truthfully, I wish I could say 4 3/4 stars because I was disappointed by the Caesar Salad. BUT...so very minor...

One word: TOTCHOS!  Yes, it&apos;s a thing and LTD did a bang job of it.  Super crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Covered in cheese, green onions, sour cream, guac...the perfect blend of tots and nachos.

Hubby and I came for Thursday Night Football, and after looking at every Yelp review for anything remotely sports-bar-ish in our area, I picked LTD.  And, was NOT disappointed. There is something for everyone here. Plenty of screens, a great variety of seating, dog &amp; kid friendly zone (I even got some dog hugs in while we watched the game...bonus!)

We were served promptly with a smile and made to feel super welcome.  We ordered our first drink during Happy Hour and asked the waiter to put the order for the 2nd round in at 6:59pm.  He was super accommodating and our drinks ARRIVED at precisely one minute before the end of Happy Hour. The Totchos arrived, hot and ooey, gooey and then....there was the salad.  Just cut up Romaine, in pieces really too small to eat easily, with virtually no dressing and these weird chunks of dark crouton.  No.

It&apos;s so nice to be able to sit on couch-style seating in the patio and watch the game. It started to rain while we were there, but we stayed dry. They have heaters in the patio area, but we didn&apos;t need them.

Our tab was more than reasonable, the wine and beer choices worked, and the atmosphere was chill and fun. I could see where it could get pretty danged loud inside the bar area during a game, but the patio was just right.  Can&apos;t WAIT to go back....I have more things to try. But, not the Caesar.  Sorry, LTD.  You can do better with this one.",Service is ass. Would loved to have given them more money if they would have taken our order...,"This is a great bar in the Fremont area. I&apos;ve been several times, and admittedly some of the bartenders are better than others - no surprise there. The first few times the bartender was exceptional - very accommodating, great recommendations on food and drinks, and attentive. That&apos;s not always the case, though, but I also give this high ratings based on their food. 

Everything is cooked to order, and they don&apos;t seem to mind making small adjustments to the food order (for example, I order the Cesar salad wrap without the dressing, and they&apos;re happy to accommodate every time). I also get the shoestring fries, which are the best in the area IMHO.

Parking can be a bit challenging - like every place in the area - but the location is great. They have an open-air feeling, thanks to the many doors and windows that open, which is especially enjoyable on nice days. They also have games inside and outside (shuffleboard, Jenga, etc) which are good for hanging out.

It&apos;s also a great place to watch sports since they have many big screen TV&apos;s. It&apos;s also kid-friendly during the day, which is nice on the more mellow days.","Went here for the NBA Finals Game 6 (congratulations to the Toronto Raptors) and this bar was packed to the brim with every seat inside and outside filled. 

LTD may have been a bit understaffed with only 2 bartenders and a waitress making rounds by the tables, serving 80+ customers in the bar. Ordered a bodhizafa on tap, burger with sweet potato fries, and had 5 buffalo wings, leaving me with a price of about $25 after tip and tax (gotta love happy hours). Our burgers took nearly 50 minutes to come out, but they were relatively faster with the beer and wings. 

The burger was meh, very ordinary. A juicy thick patty, but no lettuce or tomatoes? The amount of raw onion inside made it slightly unbearable at the end - I was feeling the spice run through my nose. The wings are really good though - they&apos;re bigger than your average bar&apos;s wings, freshly fried and not too saucy. The bodhizafa was the beer with the highest alcohol content (6.9%) but still an enjoyable drink.

I highly recommend going to this place for their happy hour, Mon-Fri 4-7PM. The food is more like a 3 out of 5 but I gave the business a holistic review because the ambience was great and prices were very fair.","Pretty solid sports bar with a particular keen-ness to The Packers. My friend and I came with intentions of snagging some happy hour beers and junk food while watching the Seahawks. 

Obviously it&apos;s a sports bar and being that it was Sunday it was packed. At first, we were just standing with our beers due to lack of seats. But 15 minutes later we were able to seat ourselves right next to our friend. Everyone was very friendly and understanding of the high energy, ebbs &amp; flows of the excitement. Dogs are welcome and met one sitting at the bar. The bar food was mediocre, nothing to write home about and easy to spend a lot of money for a football game filled day. The atmosphere was loud and energetic. We were able to meet super nice people who did not care if you rooted for the other team - very important. Nothing is more frustrating than going to a sports bar and meeting some aggressive people that are die-hard fans. 

If I had to choose another spot to watch a game in Fremont, I would choose LTD. It encompasses the label sports bar completely.","Great place to watch the game! Really enjoy the atmosphere, food and cocktails. Definitely check it out if you&apos;re in the area.","A few friends and I stopped in to LTD to watch the Michigan State football game on a Friday afternoon. There were lots of people in green and white and the atmosphere was fun and loud, great for watching football. We got a table near the shuffleboard table and had a great view of several TVs. Our server was nice and kept up with our group even as the bar got pretty busy later on. They had a happy hour menu on the table, but when we asked, we were told they weren&apos;t doing any specials. Drink prices were lower than I was expecting which was great. We ended up getting a basket of fries and some wings to snack on while we watched the game -- both were good and I would order them again. Nothing super special, but the food was hot and cooked perfectly. I noticed some other Big Ten fans coming in later so I assume this is a great place for watching other games as well. The outdoor area looked really nice and I ended up wishing we sat out there! This bar seems to be dog friendly as there was a super cute dog inside the whole time we were there.",Love this bar! So good for watching football and totally making it work with covid regulations. Great spot to stop by in Fremont.,"This is my favorite bar to watch football. These days, there are limited spots to watch football that are covid compliant, but this place is great. The food and atmosphere are top notch. The heaters keep you warm while you&apos;re rooting for your team. If you&apos;re looking for a spot where you can be socially distant while rooting for your favorite team, there is no better place on the north side of Seattle.",My husband and I stop by once in a blue moon if his Eagles games aren&apos;t playing on T.V. Service is always good here - the bartenders are super nice. Food is typical bar food.,I love to come here with my fur kids. I often come here in Happy hour time and play some game.,"Came here when The Packer&apos;s bars downtown didn&apos;t have the pre-season games. They had the game on a Wisconsin channel so it was extra fun with midwestern commercials. Can&apos;t wait to come back. Way better for groups than Buckley&apos;s QA&apos;s Packer&apos;s room or Kessler&apos;s. Lots more room. Bonus points for being down the street from a Vikings bar. The food I had was perfect, I had trouble picking what I even wanted cause their were many things I wanted to try. LTD&apos;s tator tot game is on point! Other &quot;regular&quot; bar patrons seemed friendly and a mixed bag of different teams fans. Go Pack Go!","Waited an hour and twenty minutes for our food order. The only reason we didn&apos;t cancel it was because we were playing trivia. The owner David happened to pass by us, so we asked about our order (this was after 45 minutes of waiting). Instead of promising to find out about our order or apologizing for the delay, he spoke to us in a rude manner. &quot;Did I take your order?? Then I don&apos;t know!&quot; Of course he didn&apos;t take our order, as there was only one poor server. When the order finally arrived for our group, it was terrible. The wedge salad was just a chunk of a head of lettuce covered in a mayo-like dressing and the burger was burnt. Not what we wanted or expected after such a long wait.",This place is starting to become one of my favorites in Fremont. The drinks are great and service is even better. But my favorite thing here is absolutely the music! They play old school hip hop and R &amp; B from the 90&apos;s. Highly recommend make sure you take care your bartenders,"Came here for the Rockets/Jazz game and they were playing it on like 80% of the TVs, with a baseball game and movie on the other few which was a nice variety. They have a ton of food and drink options, and a huge open space. The patio is also really nice! I was cold so they turned on the outdoor heaters for us even though we went in April so I appreciated that. They also had giant jenga and we saw a group playing beer pong so you can come socialize in other ways too!","Got a Hawaiian calzone and onion rings for pickup, and it was really good! Other pizza places I looked at seemed to be around the $15-16 price point for calzones but this one was $12! And the onion rings were legit some of the best I&apos;ve had. You know it&apos;s good when the crust doesn&apos;t just fall off and you&apos;re left eating cooked onion. The calzone was stuffed full of cheese, ham, and pineapple. Keep your pineapple on pizza opinions to yourself because this was bomb :)","I walked in to get a pizza &quot;the special &quot;
... its  so delicious.
Plus they are clean, quick organized.

Definitely recommend it !

#perfect meal to go on a covid crisis &quot;&quot;","Me &amp; my fiance ate here last night for dinner. :)  We had an Entertainment book coupon so finally decided to use it, and we&apos;re glad we did so.  He had the Athenian Calzone, and I had a Greek Spaghetti (YUM!).  Before the main entree, the lovely waitress served us tasty salads with Italian dressing.  Also, I ordered a coke, and my fiance had a sprite.  Btw, IIRC we were the only ones dining inside, so we had a good time conversing while waiting for our main entrees, which took about 10 minutes or so.  During the interim, I used their easy to access bathroom, and when I returned everything arrived, lol. :D  Our entrees were HUGE, seriously!  In fact, I was only able to finish about 2/3rds of it (my fiance finished the rest).  And I honestly don&apos;t know how he was able to finish that  GIGANTIC calzone. 8^O  He&apos;s so slim, I don&apos;t know how he does it, lol.  We&apos;d love to return here again some day when in the neighborhood - two thumbs way up!!!","Last time I ordered here I rated it 3 stars and said I wouldn&apos;t order again. Decided to give them another chance and things are much worse now. I just dropped over 80 bucks via Uber eats on one mediocre supreme style pizza, one completely inedible bbq chicken pizza that does not match the description!!! It has ultra sweet bbq sauce all over the pizza instead of red sauce as in the description and is completely inedible and the chicken is just overcooked and dry (not bbq)!

Finally the chicken wings tasted like they were cooked this morning after sitting in a freezer for 3 months, and they gave us blue cheese dressing when we requested ranch...NOT EVERYONE likes blue cheese! 

COVID has been tough for restaurants and it has been tough on everyone else, but I can&apos;t recommend that anyone spend their money here.","I walked in to pick up
my order and the cook wasn&apos;t wearing a mask! I had already paid for my food but was afraid to eat it. The person that took my order was very friendly but really, no mask?",I originally had a negative post about this place but I was reached out to by the manager Reny. She invited me back in to remake my meal. They were very accommodating and made a customer happy. Food was excellent. I would come here again.,We&apos;ve gotten pizza from these guys a couple times and it has been really good.  We like that there is actually some cheese and toppings on the pizza (unlike many other joints).  Dough is good too.  Our current favorite in the area.,The pizza was just really greasy.. I was not a big fan of that. The customer service was good but just the facts that the pizza was that greasy did it for me. I ate one slice and couldn&apos;t eat more.,"Olympia is the best! Love this spot. I&apos;ve had pizza, calzones, and salad at this location. Friendly service and delicious food. The veggie pizza is my fave!","Don&apos;t know if food is okay as I didn&apos;t eat it.as I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed the guy making it was touching his face/picking out his ear with his bare hands then prepping my pizza without washing his hands or putting gloves on. I suppose I wouldn&apos;t have been as bothered several months ago, but now it sketches me out. Apparently the worldwide concern with hygiene hasn&apos;t hit this pizza place. 

Note I don&apos;t think I could have gotten Covid19 from this so much as food poisoning, but their lack of care does make me distrustful of their concern for their customers. I doubt I&apos;ll go back. Wish I had ordered delivery so I didn&apos;t see... as I was hopeful yo find as good greasy pizza/appetizer joint.","This is a neighborhood go-to when my kids want pasta and I&apos;m too tired to actually boil water.  I generally love their greek spaghetti (hello garlic, my old friend), and their italian sausage (it&apos;s an add-on for pasta) is really yummy with a nice snap to the casing.  My kids love the gnocchi and fettuccine, which aren&apos;t hard to screw up but it&apos;s nice that they&apos;re consistent.  The wait staff are very pleasant, the happy hour deals are pretty good, and the place is kid-friendly - so I give a star for each of those and 1 more for the italian sausage (really, it&apos;s delicious).

This restaurant is not far from 2 extremely well-known italian place (Bizarro Cafe and Perche No), so if you want the high cuisine then go to those restaurants.  But for an every day meal that hits the spot without hitting the wallet too hard, I recommend Olympia.",I just had some of the best gluten free pizza I&apos;ve ever had.  It was a thin crust- just the way I like it.  Both the Cobb salad and our pizza were incredibly flavorful.  Our service was friendly and attentive.  I loved the old school pizza house atmosphere.  I also love the Greek influence.  I highly recommend this forgotten gem.,"We came in on a whim craving gluten free pizza, thinking whatever, this will be fine ... and this blew our minds. Not only was the service incredibly friendly and warm (felt like being with family), but the food was PHENOMENAL. We split the village Greek salad and GF artichoke supreme pizza. The salad was phenomenal (as good as any we ate traveling in Greece last summer)- the feta was imported from Greece with care, totally perfect - the Gf crust was excellent - thin, crispy, an ideal vehicle for thoughtfully curated, fresh, and flavorful toppings and more excellent cheese. We also enjoyed mythos beer and a nice crisp Chardonnay. LGBTQ friendly. Would come again in a heartbeat. Shocked that our food arrived so quickly because it was clearly freshly prepared and made with love. Come or get takeout !!!!!","This place is one of those hidden gems no one ever seems to think of as a go-to, but it really deserves a better rap. What it lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in killer happy hour food and wine/beer. Plus, everything I&apos;ve had so far (I&apos;ve been here twice now) is yummy. There&apos;s no bar so it&apos;s very casual but there are lots of booths so it&apos;s a fun destination or pre-game locale for meeting up with friends.","Service in Seattle is not dead. The crew at Olympia Pizza and Spaghetti House 2 were amazing.  I called last minute for a post baseball game dinner and not only did they accommodate all twelve families, but made us feel like old friends. The two waitresses did a fantastic job of taking care of our many and complicated orders. The food was great, and the service was amazing.  You are truly missing out if you don&apos;t visit Olympia Pizza 2 when you are craving pizza in or around Seattle.",Great basic Italian food with some Greek specialities thrown in. I love the manicotti and gnocchi.,"Pizza came out curiously fast, yet was inexplicably cold and gross. It had obviously been cooked for someone else and then given to us after it cooled. We told the waitress but she still charged us full price. I called the owner just to tell him his employees might not be maintaining standards, but he wanted to argue about every detail. Tried to tell me we had not been at the restaurant. Then he tried to tell me I had not complained soon enough. Exhausting. 

This place was great when Dino owned it. Now it is not. Ironically, it was the &quot;Dino&apos;s Special&quot; that they screwed up.","I used to order from the Queen Anne Olympia all the time and am so happy to once again be able to get delivery from them! Hands down, the best pizza in town.",Pizza is okay. Crust was tasty.  I always go to Pagliacci&apos;s; but decided to give them a try. Good customer service and listened to my special ordering requests. Not sure if I would go back. Also their largest pizza isn&apos;t all that large.,"We have been going to this place since my daughter was little, and we love it! The people are very friendly, and the food is delicious.

We have tried lots of their food, and here are our favorites: 

Calzones: delicious, but big! May last you 2 meals. 

Salads: the salads are VERY big. They have fresh vegetables in them. I would consider getting a half salad if you don&apos;t want a huge salad. 

Manicotti: my sister tried this, and she said it was tasty! 

Spaghetti: the spaghetti is basic, sauce is delicious!

The place feels like a neighborhood family hangout. It&apos;s casual, and they have customers that are regulars(like us). One waitress we liked was Anita. She was sweet, friendly, and a good waitress. She always remembers us when we come in. It makes us feel special that they always remember us, even if we hadn&apos;t been there for a while. Another great waitress was Irene. She is also the owner, and is always happy to see us. 

Olympia Pizza is a great restaurant!","I have always loved Thai Tom, and over the years they are still consistent and awesome! Thai tom is very vegetarian friendly! And the peanut sauce is sooo good! 

Ordered take out during covid. It was ready for pickup in 15 mins. Good precautions to ensure minimal external contamination!","Used to be absolutely the best Thai anywhere.  Still 5 star, but Something has changed lately though not sure what.  Still VERY good after all these years.  Pad Thai is the standard.  Love the crunchy char on the noodle that comes from the super hot wok and al dente preparation.  

I used to love sitting inside at the counter.  One is no more than 3 ft from the fire, and it&apos;s amazing to watch and smell aromas as the chef prepares the food.  Now with Covid, we get take out, and the food is still good, just without the &quot;show.&quot;","Our go to no-frills thai food! Bean sprouts tofu, panang curry, and fried rice are favorites! Only downside being no delivery and only cash. Would order much more frequently if they did delivery!","I wish we had a better experience here, but unfortunately that was not the case. After seeing several reviews noting the steady decline from its heyday, we weren&apos;t as excited to try it out. However, we were in the area and said &quot;what the heck!&quot; and went for it.

With the current restrictions, customers are not allowed inside the restaurant and instead are to place their orders through the small window out front. I thought that was a great way to keep social distancing and facilitate orders as quickly and smoothly as possible. Given the location being on a busy foot traffic street, this would allow people to place their orders and stroll around the area as they wait.

Out came a lovely lady who was also giving take out orders to hungry customers. I have to say I was surprised that she came out the door rather than open the window. Seemed counterintuitive, but no biggie.

We went with their tofu pad thai, since that was one of the dishes that they&apos;re known for. Paid cash, and after 10 minutes, our order was ready..super fast! We jetted back to our car and headed home looking forward to chomping down some noodles.

At first glance, it didn&apos;t look anything like other pad thai dishes we&apos;ve had. That&apos;s okay..looks can be deceiving and everybody has their own way of making this street style dish. Took a bite and other than the spice level sending a surge up my nose (!), the flavor was completely off. There was no hint of tamarind, fish sauce or anything that is normally in pad thai. The noodles were burnt to a crisp which wouldn&apos;t be bad considering the char flavor enhances the tamarind/sugar/fish sauce base, but since it wasn&apos;t there, it just tasted burnt and crispy. There were vegetables in there that aren&apos;t traditionally there and they looked old and felt like an afterthought. Tofu was old as well. Portion was embarrassing even for 1 person, yet alone 2.

Overall, it just missed the mark. I will give them kudos on their choice of PP 5 plastic container for their food orders, which is better for the environment.

In any case, it&apos;s unfortunate this is how it came to be, and I know so many businesses are hurting right now, but food has gotta be better than this! I hope things improve for them, but we won&apos;t be back anytime soon.","I really wanted to like this place, but the way they served my curry take-out was simply mind-boggling. I really should have taken a picture of the set-up but generally, you know how Thai places separate the rice and curry into different containers for take out?

Thai Tom literally COMBINED the rice and curry into a large Styrofoam container, so the rice was completely soggy by the time I got home. Moreover, the rice:curry ratio was rather ridiculous, essentially a mountain of soggy rice, with a sad puddle of curry in the corner. Will not be returning.","Okay, this has been one of my favorite Thai spots for a while now in Seattle. Their menu is somewhat limited but every entree is the same price. They are a CASH ONLY restaurant. The last 2 times I picked up food there, I was a little disappointed. Last time I picked up some pad Thai and it just didn&apos;t have the wok hei (breath of the wok?) that it normally had and a lot of my noodles were clumped up AND the chili was not distributed evenly. The time before that, I ordered the panang curry (second time) and it wasn&apos;t good at all. Not sure if they changed cooks or quality control just went bad? I&apos;ll probably go back again, but if it&apos;s not good for the third time then I probably won&apos;t go back anymore.","I seriously love Thai Tom. If you&apos;ve never been here and you&apos;re in the U District, do yourself a favor and just stop by. 

I will say that the service isn&apos;t the best and it&apos;s cash only (no prices on the menu either lol) but it&apos;s all part of the experience. It&apos;s such a tiny place that they literally cook the food in front of you. I feel like it&apos;s a college version of Benihana. Haha! 

I come here a lot and here&apos;s what I&apos;ve tried:

- PAD THAI (10/10): this is probably the closest I&apos;ve tasted to street food in Thailand. I prefer it with chicken or just veggies. Be sure to ask for extra chili powder and the green chilies if you want some extra spice. 

- THAI CURRY FRIED RICE (8/10): it&apos;s pretty much what you&apos;d expect, it just lacks consistency for me. Otherwise great option if you like curry and fried rice. 

- THAI TEA (9/10): it&apos;s good, just sometimes a tad overly sweet 

- THAI COFFEE (6/10): it&apos;ll be honest - it&apos;s not my favorite drink I&apos;ve had. It was interesting, but I won&apos;t get it again. It tastes like they added coffee to Thai Tea, which is why I thought I&apos;d like it. 

I definitely stop here almost every time I&apos;m in the U District! If you like Thai, give it a go!","I have been coming here for 8 years now. My husband is a big fan. He came here since first year of college. The wait here to dine in always take forever, like about 30mins to 1 hour standing in the cold. But if you go by yourself or togo, its so much faster. 

I have tried almost everything on the menu. I love the Thai salad, its not on the menu. I also love fried tofu (mostly because of the peanut dipping sauce) pad thai and swimming rama. Their food are all flavorful, but more on the sweet side. Sometimes I think its not neccessary to be this sweet. There were two times my food came out very salty (2 stars spiciness), salty to the point that I felt sick after. Their food burned most of the time but I guess I like the burn flavor from the big fire. 

The restaurant is dirty, I dont think they clean often. The service here is terrible. They will rush you out for the next guests and also cash only. If the tip is not at least 10%, there will be a reminder from the server hahaha but I dont care cause its good.","So good!! I never understood the hype for Thai Tom so I never really went when I was here for college. I&apos;m used to seeking out the wok/charred smell of Thai/Asian food cooked in high heat(&quot;wok hey&quot; if you know the reference) and this place does satisfy it ! Portion-wise, it is relatively smaller than most places in Udistrict - but the taste does make up for it.

Pad Thai, Pad see ew and pad kee mao (Drunken noodles) are all solid choices!",Covid times review - they have shortened their menu (totally understandable) but they have drastically reduced the food quantity and also the veggies they would add in any of their meat dishes.. we have ordered multiple times and everytime our panang curry would come with very few brely 2-3 pieces of chicken and very few bell peppers (sometimes none).. this is not the Thai Tom i was willing to drive to enjoy amazing thai food.. its now a normal thai place (the food is still good the sauce is flavorful) but i wouldnt want to drive to eat such a mediocre meal.. I miss my old thai tom food!,"A friend recommended this place and some youtuber highlight this as a must visit place. I didn&apos;t even read the reviews anymore but I should&apos;ve. Was kinda disappointed, taste wise I can tell the cook wasn&apos;t paying much attention to how hot the wok is. Some can make burnt fried egg into art and tasty but this is not the case. 
Probably The time I came, it was already a different chef therefore the taste wasn&apos;t as people would raved before.

Local seems to be okay with the taste. I see lots of regulars. Friendly service and thoughtful price.
Curry fried rice tasted more of like a burnt egg with little curry flavor. I asked very spicy, but it is not spicy at all.
Thai fried rice - tasted ok, could&apos;ve use a little more soy sauce... again, fried egg -burnt.
Pad see yew - this probably taste more decent than the first 2.

Thai ice coffee is great, enough to keep me up driving to our next stop. 
Thank you Thai Tom! 
I appreciate you for being open during my visit.","I would wish I could give Thai Tom 4 stars but the quality isn&apos;t quite there anymore. I&apos;ve been eating Thai Tom for over five years now and it used to be my favorite Thai restaurant in the greater Seattle area.

The positives:
* The chefs are always working hard and efficiently so the food is prepared fast for how busy it gets (usually 10-15 minute wait time before it&apos;s ready)
* It&apos;s a neat experience--you get to watch the chefs cook your dish in action if you get seated at the raised table on the right
* Plenty of options to choose from (including vegetarian food)
* Flavorful and spicy level is customizable (but be careful, it tends to be on the spicier side)

The negatives:
* The value has gone down over the years. The food still tastes great but with the price increase they actually give you a smaller portion compared to what it used to be.
* There&apos;s limited protein options: chicken, tofu, and shrimp (extra $1). There used to be beef and pork but looks like they put it off the menu.
* The wait can be long (average is 15-45 minutes before you&apos;re seated) 

Although Thai Tom has changed a bit, I still enjoy coming here whenever I&apos;m on the ave.","Located in UDistrict, this place has been a hot topic amongst my friends. Personally, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience of the chef cooking right in front us in a tightly spaced restaurant. It felt cozy and &quot;interactive&quot; in a way - we sat elbow to elbow. 

Quick note: it&apos;s cash only. We luckily sat next to a nice person who gave us cash for Venmo. There is an ATM nearby I believe. 

We got two different curries: panang with tofu and thai curry fried rice. We shared them, and they were both delicious! I&apos;d definitely come back to try their other dishes.","(cash only)
Thai Tom is a small restaurant on the Ave that is known to sometimes have a line - and for good reason! It is a really good shop! The interior is kinda small so I&apos;d recommend only if you have a small group of 2 if you want to dine in. A lot of people like getting takeout so that&apos;s an option too! 

Their curries have always been solid in my experience! I recently enjoyed the Kung Fu w/ chicken (#8 on menu), which was a bean sprout stir fry over rice. 

Definitely going to keep coming back here!","This restaurant epitomizes &apos;hole in the wall&apos; - seats 15-20 people with the food being cooked on a blazing wok right near you.

Food: (5/5) Excellent! I eat here about a dozen times a year, and while I do end up ordering the same stuff, I have consistently loved all the food at Thai Tom, to the point where I crave it! Highly recommend the Pad Thai (I get it with chicken *and* veggies) - it is not the usual sweet stuff other American-Thai restaurants serve, so expect a bit of a kick. Also recommend the curries and the cashew chicken. *Vegetarians* - everything can be done with tofu/veggies; if you don&apos;t like or are allergic to fish sauce, call it out very explicitly because they tend to rush through taking and cooking the order.

Ambience: (3/5) On the fence. It&apos;s weird rating a place like this for it&apos;s ambience because that isn&apos;t their intended USP. It is supposed to be a tiny, authentic no-frills place and not always the cleanest. Recommend going with a max of 2-3 people if you want a seat in less than an hour. Late afternoons on weekends are better than peak lunch time.

Service: (2/5) Meh. This is an area where they could do so much better. While the service is super fast and mostly able to handle crowds flocking outside the restaurant, the servers are not pleasant and sometimes even rude. That being said, know that I will be going again and again and again for that 5/5 food :)

Note: Thai Tom is cash-only; with 2 entrees and 2 thai iced teas, it usually ends up being $35.","The Thai Tom of January 2020 through (at least) May 2020 is not the same Thai Tom as before--what happened?

Perhaps ownership change, management change, or a philosophy change? Who knows, as I won&apos;t continue to speculate. What is known is that Thai Tom&apos;s food quality and service (already a low bar) has deteriorated to notably lower levels.

To start, phone orders is the only way to place an order here during the pandemic. You will often be put on hold for more than 10 minutes (up to 20 minutes on one occasion). If you&apos;re lucky to get an order in, the wait at peak times is communicated as one hour. OK--acceptable. What is not acceptable is when you arrive the restaurant one hour later and rudely get told you have to wait an unknown amount of time longer for the food to be ready. 

Great--you now have your food. The food these days is dry, sometimes burnt to a crisp on noodle edges, and varying levels of flavoring (sometimes too salty, sometimes very bland). This was never the way Thai Tom of 2019 and before was. That is too bad. 

For those of you who haven&apos;t been to Thai Tom in 2020, please lower your expectations and be cautious. The food is still acceptable; it&apos;s just not the same as it was before.","Overall Thai Tom is okay. Their food tastes really good, but the service, communication, and overall experience are poor. Lemme explain...

First off, I hate writing negative reviews. If you look through my reviews here and on my YouTube series Seattle Eats (by channel Sub7 Fitness) you&apos;ll see that this is my very first one below 3 or 4 stars. So yenno when I write one you know it&apos;s serious.

The wait for my order was 24.5 minutes. That sounds reasonable... typically when you order in or call ahead most places would say 20-25 minutes. But let me preface this:

Thai Tom is an Ave favorite. On The Ave most restaurants will have your order ready within 10 minutes, especially if you order less than 3 things. I ordered two.

In addition to this, 4 parties that placed orders after us were served before us. Including parties that ordered the exact same two dishes as us. Each time that someone who ordered after us was served before us made me a little more angry.

There was no communication. 

Literally, they could&apos;ve just said it&apos;ll be 20-25 minutes, and that would be problem solved. But they didn&apos;t. They never gave an estimated time and with no one else in line ahead of us I thought this would be typical ave wait time.

In addition to this I ordered two items at $10.75 each and was charged $25. So I believe they included tax and tip when they gave me the price. With no receipt, I couldn&apos;t tell you how something that should&apos;ve been $21.50 became $25 before tip.

My dish (drunken noodles) was delicious. My fianc√©&apos;s dish (pad see ew) was not so good. It wasn&apos;t necessarily bad, but there is much better pad see ew out there (including two blocks away at Noodle Nation). 

All-in-all it was unfortunately a bad experience.","Extremely rude customer service when ordering over phone,  when they said cash only I went to check my wallet and he asked if I&apos;d been there before and I said yes but many years ago and he said what like ten years ago? I didn&apos;t understand how that was helpful to anyone and came off as rude. Thai food was good but not the best, def not good enough to go back.","DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE! The servings are tiny so it&apos;s honestly a rip off. Most of my garlic chicken was rice. There were about 3 small pieces of thin, dry chicken in the whole dish, and maybe 2 pieces of uncooked broccoli. The noodles have a horrible, mushy texture and taste like sweet cardboard. The fried rice, and frankly everything else, had barely any flavor. I read the 3.5 star reviews before deciding to order Thai Tom, thinking it had to be mostly good ratings considering there were 2,200 of them. I was such a fool! They also only accept cash which they didn&apos;t notify me of before I gave them my order. I&apos;ve never had such bad and disappointing Thai food.",I get dreams about the Thai curry fried rice I ate here. Best fried rice I ever ate. The food is so good that I&apos;m okay with wait times and the &apos;Only cash&apos; policy.,Wonderful shrimp tempura roll! Nice and crispy shrimp. Also yummy spicy salmon poke bowl. Avocado was sliced right ripeness. Beautiful presentation. Petite portion sizes with high quality fresh and decadent ingredients. Takeout was easy and ready in 30 mins. Nicely packaged with access to condiments and utensils. Would visit again.,"This is the sweetest Japanese restaurant. My daughter and I were starving after going to the zoo and playing in the park for hours. We happened upon Modern Japanese and decided to eat here. When we first arrived the only two tables in the front of the restaurant were taken, so we briefly sat at the sushi bar until one table cleared. 

I ordered chicken karaage for my daughter, salmon nigiri and another roll, which I can&apos;t remember now, but in that moment, it was good hehe. Everything we got was delicious. Simply, but tasty. The karaage was soft, portion was small, so my daughter ate it all. Salmon nigiri was good piece of salmon. Overall, I was happy with our meal. 

Our server was friendly. People were in and out with orders, but otherwise it was just our table and another table for the duration of our lunch. The space was nice and clean, including the restroom. I believe there is outdoor seating for when it&apos;s warm out. I&apos;m rarely in this area, especially now that our zoo membership is expired, but if in the area, would love to visit again.","Ordered the chicken teriyaki bento via UberEats and it was delicious! The chicken oddly reminded me of filipino chicken adobo with whatever the way they marinated it and seasoned it. It even looked like chicken adobo just cubed and minus the sabaw (soup). 

Portions were good for one person! The only con was the edamame got cold when it got to me which is expected with delivery.","They failed to put any utensils with my order or soy sauce.
Very frustrating!!!!!!! Expensive delivery and 2nd time this has happened!!!","Stopped by to picked up dessert for a friend&apos;s birthday. Ended up picking up the tiramisu and matcha dessert cheesecake for her and the mochi&apos;s for me. The mochi&apos;s I have to say were AMAZING...the texture and right amount of sweetness just melted in my mouth and I can see going back to pick up more. Will have to ask my friend what she thought of her desserts. I have tried the tiramisu before when a friend brought over and remembered it as pretty darn delicious.

The gentlemen who greeted me at the store was warm &amp; welcoming &amp; helpful. He gave me great suggestions on desserts and also informed me of their patio availability and happy hour info. He definitely encompassed what great customer service and care means, and was a great representative for the shop in my opinion.

I look forward to stopping by in the future to try their food menus as well as pick up more mochis",These are fucking Oscar Meyer hot dogs NOT &quot;Japanese pork sausage&quot;.  If your business is suffering that bad from COVID just take it off the damn menu. Shame on whoever was working today for the bait and switch. 1st and last time I will ever eat here. Sushi was stale too....,"This place is kind of small, have a nice backside for couples of tables maybe 2-3.. I was recommend by family in Seattle to come to try this place, we ordered a few rolls and a rainbow poke to try.  The sushi rolls were just ok, nothing very memorable ( I just remember how I didn&apos;t like the lion king, the cooked salmon in it was very fishy and combined with the shiso leaves gave me a weird taste)

Their rainbow Pok√© was ok, I felt their fish were a little slimmy and fishy tho.","After reading some raves on the Ballard Facebook groups we checked this place out this week. It was so delicious!!!! We ordered via the phone and get were super nice and we picked our food up ourselves. Everything we ordered was fresh and so yummy. I got the salmon bento box, it was so cute and good. We got sushi too and it was really great. We will definitely go back!","I tried take out from Modern a few weeks ago while i was in the area. Seemed a bit pricey for the small portions I received, but im wiling to try again in the future with different menu items. It was hard to resist the dessert options!","I was really disappointed in our meal. The portions were exceptionally small. We were shocked when we opened up the tiny containers. For $85, I expected to be able to feed a family of 4 especially given that two of us are younger children. Everyone was still hungry after all the food was gone. And it wasn&apos;t even good. The udon was bland as was the sushi itself. The kara-age fried chicken was lukewarm and doughy, not crispy. We&apos;ve had kara-age in Oakland, CA before that was amazing. This felt like kara-age from McDonalds in comparison. What a bummer. Will not be back.","Honestly, I&apos;m hard-pressed to find good Japanese food near me, but this place is phenomenal! I had the Dragon roll and it was SO good. We also ordered the Unagi bowl and the eel was amazing and melted in my mouth and just overall was so yummy. The desserts were equally great. We ordered the matcha cake roll, baked cheesecake and tiramisu cup. The matcha cake roll was fluffy, the cheesecake dense and creamy, and the tiramisu sweet and flavorful. Bonus: super cute decor :) 10/10 would recommend!","I didn&apos;t have a good experience at this restaurant despite  the other people high ratings. The server seem like he wasn&apos;t experience in the F&amp;B industry and the food was lacking,especially my tempura udon. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because the price is reasonable, the staff was pleasant, and it was a cute looking restaurant.","We could place an order after noon is too late as a busy office lunch order. The Uber Eats website does not accept any order in until restaurant&apos;s  open time.  We have ordered our office lunch today with my co-workers&apos; recommendation. Since restaurant&apos;s opening time is so late, my lunch time ended up with after 3 PM. I can not use your restaurant again next time. It is too late to open for our businesses lunch time.  2nd, my order was quite different from my expectation. I ordered a Chicken Katsudon and a Hijiki Salad. Katsudon was not with chicken Katsu. It was a small chicken nugget bowl. Katsu supposed be covered with bread crumbs for the extra texture and crispiness. If you want to keep this menu ,you should change the name to more proper name. Then you can avoid any confusion with real Japanese food lovers. Hijiki salad, your web menu description says &quot; Hijiki Salad: Black seaweed cooked with carrot, fried tofu, and edamame in our original dashi.
But what I got as a Hijiki Salad does not have any carrot, fried tofu. Edamame was 3-4 pieces on the top of the Hijiki as a garnishment only. I ordered for my better nutrition.   So, it was a big disappointment for me without any other vegetables. also, only Hijiki is a little tough to eat,(the nature of the Hijiki, I feel it is so dry. Hard to enjoy only Hijiki its self) even if I am a native Japanese. Thank you for reading this for me and your time.","A very cute restaurant right next to Woodland park zoo. This place is stingy. We ordered a chicken karaage curry. It came with a whopping 3 piece of chicken of a size of a pinky lol. I kid you not. I am dead serious. And it&apos;s $14!  Also the karaage was burnt so after I removed the burnt portion I had probably 1 and half piece left lol. The price is OK but come on....I expect better portion? the taste is ok nothing exceptional. We also order the spicy poke bowl. It&apos;s not good. The vinegar is too overpowering and again very stingy on the fish and it was $16!? I could probably get better poke cheaper and tastier in a lot of other places.

Maybe I was in a bad mood with my main course, I found the dessert mediocre...  

In general they have decent tasting food but super stingy on portion with. The environment is very nice with natural breeze and soft jazz. I would definitely come again if they change owner. 

I honestly don&apos;t know how this place got such a a high rating.","Really good - had rolls and the sashimi salad and been getting takeout quite a bit since Covid. Really great, wish they opened at 11:30am...I hate to wait until noon to order lunch!","My friend recommended this Japanese bistro near Green Lake to me and we had brunch here on Sunday. It was raining so we sat inside. I guess it would be really lovely to sit outside when it&apos;s sunny. We had sashimi salad, teriyaki salmon and curry. There four different kinds of fishes in the salad, all of which were fresh and tasted great. It was my first time seeing salmon going together with teriyaki sauce, and it turned out to be yummy. The set also included sushi rolls. The curry was authentic and we added karaage in it, which were juicy and tender. We had matcha shake and matcha latte for drink, and both of them were awesome. Good service and nice vibe. We really enjoyed the time here.","I have been wanting to try out this place for awhile because I used to follow Setsuko&apos;s recipes on local Japanese community paper. I was... disappointed. It&apos;s not because of the taste of sweets, but by the atmosphere. 
I rode my bike there. I got sweaty because I had a climb to Phinney Ave from Green Lake. When I walked in with a helmet on, I probably saw 4 employees and a customer, but none said &quot;hi.&quot; Then I heard &quot;well, an interesting getup person just came in&quot; in Japanese by the customer. After that, silence. No greeting whatsoever. I should have made sure to look at their face when I spoke and ordered what I wanted in Japanese (or just scolded them and walked out). 
The only saving grace was a Ballard HS student who works there because he is taking a Japanese class. He was polite unlike the rest of the adult employees. Shame on you, adults. I hope your snobby attitude isn&apos;t rubbing off on him.",This place was amazing! Such a cool little vibe. When you first walk in it&apos;s almost like a cafe because there&apos;s tea and a pastry case full of all kinds of goodies. But then there&apos;s also a sushi bar. Very fresh and flavorful. The poke bowl was amazing. I highly recommend the seared salmon nigiri as well as the caterpillar roll! Their miso was just what I needed on this rainy seattle day.,"Ever since I ordered a cake from them for my wedding, I&apos;ve been wanting to try their food. I finally made it in and ordered their curry, tempura udon, happy hour edamame and sashimi. I really wanted to like them because their menu items are uniquely Japanese but alas, the entire experience was very underwhelming.

1. Japanese portions with Seattle prices. In other words, portions are tiny compared to what you pay.

2. Execution needs improvement: The edamame needed more salt and was over cooked. The tempura came out soggy. 

3. Service: Our waitress was nice and attentive, but she was not familiar with the menu. 

The curry was definitely the best dish, however it was standard curry that I could make a home. I would not pay $15 bucks again.

Their desserts are great. Stick to the desserts.","Cute little restaurant in phinney ridge. It&apos;s nice to have a Japanese place in this neighborhood. I came in 10 minutes before closing for lunch.

$14.99 for a lunch special sashimi salad. It definitely wasn&apos;t what I was expecting. I too had high expectations for this restaurant. They gave me a box filled with bagged greens, 7 pieces of fish, and a tiny 1/4 filled sauce cup. Really?!

No wasabi and just a little sauce for this salad? I wasn&apos;t happy at all. I couldn&apos;t even go in to complain. 

Please be more generous with your salad dressing next time.","We ordered take-out (Caviar) for the 2nd time. We had the Eggs Florentine Benedict, the breakfast quesadilla, carrot cake (we may or may not have each got a piece...), and mimosas (both may or may not have been just for me... *wink*).  
The food is great!   My only disappointment is that I&apos;d included special instructions to please cook hash browns dark/well done/crispy, and that didn&apos;t happen at all. However- they were still good!!   There will definitely be a 3rd order placed - likely in the near future!  
Thank you, 14 Carrot Cafe, for keeping us nourished during the pandemic!",Their chicken salad is the best! And the carrot cake is sooo good. They have take out and we&apos;re seating a few customers a week or so ago. Worth a try.,"I ordered their signature carrot cake pancake through Caviar delivery. Warm food, tasty and fast.","DO NOT GET FOOD HERE!!!
I have never been so disappointed ordering food from somewhere. I literally have to finish cooking this before I can eat it. Like is it even safe to eat? And at this price?? Like I understand that things happen, but I&apos;d rather my food take longer than receive a pile of raw potato and soggy bread. Not to mention this quesadilla is mostly tortilla?
Whoever made this has brought shame upon the food industry.
How can you make hash browns that aren&apos;t even brown.
Get  it  together","While I do try to be understanding and have compassion for businesses that are struggling during covid, there were just too many things wrong here. We ordered take out and I got toast and hash browns with my order and they were almost completely uncooked. As in my &quot;toast&quot; was still white and soft and the hash browns were barely brown in a couple of places and looked like a big soggy mess. My boyfriend got coffee cake with his order that was so hard he needed a knife to cut through it and it basically ended up being inedible, which is a shame since it costs extra to add it on. My omelet was very tasty, but that was about the only thing that went right. What is most alarming to me is that my boyfriend went to pick it up and said that the indoor dining was completely packed and definitely not at the 25% capacity that we are currently allowed. I understand how difficult it is for businesses right now, but in the restaurant industry when you are dealing with patrons that are unmasked for long periods of time, it puts everyone at risk, particularly the staff, and that is completely unacceptable to me. Everyone is doing their best, but putting profits over safety will never be okay in my book.",For the carrot cake! This was a hefty cake full of incredible flavor. Holy delicious Batman!,"This review is long overdue. My husband and I have gone here for brunch every Saturday for the last month, which speaks volume to how GOOD this place is. 

Their carrot cake pancakes are UH-mazing (huge, fluffy and warm). As you can imagine, a place called &quot;14 Carrots&quot; MUST have good carrot dishes. This review can vouch it REALLY does. I recommend asking for extra cream cheese frosting, as they only give you a tiny dollop.","This cafe was located down the street from our Airbnb so we decided to give it a try and so happy we did! 

Staff was nice, portion sizes were super generous, food was good, and there was lots of seating inside. Cute place for brunch and their orange juice was so fresh and yummy!","Found this homey brunch spot when my friends were visiting from out of town. Safe to say I&apos;ll be taking a lot more friends back to eat some more of their delicious egg benedicts. We had some mimosas to top it off and had a fun time before heading out to the airport. Service was friendly, I see why there was a line when we showed up!","Easy, delicious, and a lot of options for those with dietary restrictions. I enjoy and highly recommend to check out the chalkboard above the kitchen for the daily specials because those are the best and (I hope) seasonally relevant. 

The cost seems a little much but I got a lot of food and was able to take 1/3 with me home for breakfast the next day after already stuffing myself silly. So, as long as I can get to a fridge soon to store my leftovers, this place is well worth it. 

I came in on Sunday around 10am and didn&apos;t have to wait long for a table. Server was attentive but kindly reminded me he&apos;s going to keep coming over if I have my menu folded away because then he thinks I&apos;m ready to order. It&apos;s like, look man, we&apos;re catching up and engrossed in a conversation. I&apos;m sorry I haven&apos;t been able to look at the menu and pick what I want yet. There was a small line and wait by the time we left a little after 11am.","I wanted to explore what Eastlake has to offer so I was able to come across this lovely cozy cafe with my friend who lives in the area. We were immediately greeted with the friendly staff as well as the owner who was very energetic about the carrot related items they had which I found to be fun!

I ordered one of the specials which was a crab cake benedict. It came with a side of shredded potatoes, which were very crispy and seasoned well. The crab cakes were also delicious and fresh and I was delighted to see how large these crab cakes were! It was also topped off with a generous amount of avocado slices that were perfectly ripe.

I will definitely come back to try the carrot cake since I was so full after my meal since it looked so good :)!","I should start off by saying I am somewhat of a carrot cake connoisseur. If I see carrot cake on the menu, I will order it. Even (or maybe especially?) as a prequel to brunch because my Hinge date is late. This is my lifestyle folks!

So, yes, I came here on a Hinge date who ended up being hideously late so I started breakfast with a piece of their carrot cake - HEAVENLY! - a peach bellini (not pictured), and a glass of champagne. Since this was my first time here, I ordered the eggs benedict because I like to try it everywhere. I was not disappointed! Portions were very generous and the hollandaise had a great flavor. Service was also super friendly and the decor in this place is a delightfully charming mix of funky, homey, and eclectic.

They apparently have a carrot cinnamon roll so...I will definitely be back!","The homemade jam here is incredible! That alone would make me go back. The food is so good...cute little neighborhood place. I had pancakes and they were so fluffy! Just like I like them. We had gluten free toast with jams and my daughter had a crazy omelette stuffed with potatoes,onions, feta, etc. So delicious.",The breakfast burrito alone is worth the trip here. The staff is also so friendly and attentive. Highly recommend 14 Carrot!,"Maybe they were having an off day? I came here because of the great reviews but the food and service were not what I expected. 

Pros:
- no wait at 12:30pm on a Saturday
- lots of menu options
- fun specials (e.g. pumpkin pancakes)
- it&apos;s a hole-in-the-wall feel but very bright and sunny inside
- our female waiter was very nice

Cons:
- the other guy waiters in the restaurant (who seated us and checked on us once) were not very nice and seemed irritated that we were even talking to them
- the staff did not seem very knowledgeable about their food and were unwilling to check ingredients (I went with a friend who has a food allergy)
- the food was pretty unpleasant (I had the eggs florentine. The english muffin was soggy from the spinach and tomato, which were both very flavorless. My friend had an omelette, which was he said was mediocre. Maybe other menu items are better?)","My wife and I went on a magical journey today. We entered the door and were promptly seated right in the window so we could people watch. Before we had even placed our bums in the seats our host had told us about the watermelon mimosa&apos;s and with wide saucer like eyes we ordered a pair. 

As we looked around this quaint little caf√© my wife began telling me about how she had been there 24 years ago. She remarked about how it had not changed one bit and how if their cinnamon rolls were the same, it would be the icing on the top. Just moments later our server places a steaming hot cinnamon roll on our table with a smile and my wife clapped her hands like a giddy little schoolgirl with happy memories in her eyes. We attack this thing with knives and forks because it is so hot and fresh. But the flavor is unbelievable. The layers of cinnamon in this thing are indescribable. 

I had ordered carrot cake pancakes and I am glad I had. They are the tastiest thing I have ever had for breakfast in my life hands down. They&apos;re literally like eating carrot cake in pancake form. they have the texture and form of a pancake but it is a cake. It&apos;s magical, I don&apos;t understand it. But is the best thing you could have for breakfast. When our host told me he was the one who made the batter, I told him he was a bad bad man and should be ashamed of himself for making something so very good. He smiled and simply went off to get us more watermelon mimosas.","Went here for brunch today, very delicious and highly recommended! They have a lot of options and daily specials. Their sake Bloody Mary is super good too. Service was quick and friendly","Great breakfast place! Very authentic, nice personnel. I had huevos rancheros and I tried them in different places; this one was one of the best! Great coffee too.","Really wanted carrot cake on a Monday, and I&apos;ve been meaning to come by forever! The owner was so sweet and the vibe inside was incredibly cozy, with some great music playing. Definitely want to come out for a more substantial meal, but the carrot cake was very good - moist and dense, perfect size of slice.

Thank you!","14 Carrot Cafe: 8.5/10

Return customer? - YES","So first time outside of downtown Seattle. Ended up at this place with my 5 of my buddies. We were seated instantly and the waitress got our drink orders really quick.

I ordered a Honey Mustard Wrap with sweet potato fries and I was quite happy with the meal! I usually dont finish but this time, I did! Including the sweet potato fries!!","Very limited selection on draft beverages.  The Park Junior burger is exceptionally tiny, and with lesser ingredients than the regular burgers, as in flaccid small white bread bun, itty bitty preformed frozen meat patty, and sad &quot;cheese&quot;. If I had known, I would have ordered differently.  

Total disappointment.",The two servers were high. It took 30 minutes to get a beer in a relatively empty restaurant (the full beers were sitting below the taps for the entire time and we had to go up and physically ask for them). The burgers and tots were awesome. The chicken strips/fries were burnt. We ordered a second round of canned beers...the waitress put in the order and never brought them. We closed out and were charged for the beers we never received...corrected the bill and the guy over corrected and accidentally took off the food. We again had to correct it to 2 beers and 2 food items. Just unbelievably careless and uncoordinated service,"I recently went back here for dinner. It was definitely not as good as the other times I had been here. They were pretty much out of everything on the menu so options were limited. I had a burger which was not the best, a ton of bread and an over cooked patty. Our food also sat under the warming lamps for quite a while, not super fresh when it finally arrived to our table. One dinner at our table was fish &amp; chips which wasn&apos;t all fish, they threw in a piece of chicken, they probably ran out of fish too and thought no one would know the difference. Our waitress was uninterested in our poor experience. I doubt I&apos;ll stop here again.","Super crispy garlic fries were calling my name the moment I walked in the door, and an icy-cold ale got the afternoon off onto the right foot from the start. 

Nachos were delicious, but so huge, we will definitley share next time.  My fish and chips were exactly what I was expecting, but again, it was a huge portion (that I ate completely..oink, oink).

Friendly barkeepers let me try two drops of a couple of brew types, but I kept coming back to the ale.  Be careful when drinking here, the beer is so cold, you might get a brainfreeze (and that&apos;s a good thing).",Very cool place with a good happy hour menu. Bartenders are attentive and keep rolling throughout. Noise level about average and kid friendly. No pets - thank goodness!,"We were the first in when they opened at 3pm on a Friday so it was obviously quiet but perfect for our late lunch after a family visit to the zoo. Wish we were locals so we could come back. Kids had pigs in blankets and cheeseburger sliders and ate it all, we had salmon sliders and fish and chips and left very happy. Great beer, great food, great service.","Nice low-key spot with good beer and food. Friendly, nice for a quick stop on our day around town. We came in mid-day Saturday and each had a beer and split the pork nachos, which were very tasty. The food was on the pricier side, $17 for pork nachos is steep, but the portion size was good for the price at least. The hot sauce served with it is good but I was also hoping for some homemade salsa (something spicier than the included pico). We will return if in the area again.","The food was three stars but the service was great and I would definitely come back. I came in with my brother a few minutes after 11PM as the kitchen was closing. The bartender asked the kitchen to stay open for our meals which was super nice. We were starving and desperate for some grub! 

The restaurant was very accommodating of my gluten allergy and has multiple gluten free offerings (even a few gluten free beers).",Will never return.  Staff was unfriendly and we had to ask for service at our table.  A dollar spent at this establishment is a dollar too much.,"We came here on a whim and it turns out, it&apos;s a Georgia bar which made the Sugar Bowl fun to watch! The food is amazing... my husband got the burger, I got the buffalo chicken wrap and we shared some delicious trolley tots! This place has a really good vibe and the service is great too! We can&apos;t wait to come back again!","How I heard of this place: Yelp. In search of a spot to share a meal with friends before rushing to the Woodland Park Zoo for WildLights, we came across The Park. With four stars (&quot;Yay! I&apos;m a fan.), it&apos;s pub grub, and proximity to the Zoo, plus being child-friendly, we were sold.

Type of cuisine: Pub Grub. Sliders, pretzels and chicken wings to start; pulled pork and reuben sandwiches, burgers, nachos and fish &apos;n chips, there is a little something for everyone. A happy hour menu is also offered between 3:00 and 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Ambiance: Dark, dimly lit space with checkered floors and booth seating as well as table/chair seating, televisions viewable from all areas of the establishment, holiday decoration in full bloom, and a bar for beer-lovers, the space is quite old, un-updated and very much a neighborhood joint. 

What I ordered: To start, Spam Sliders ($9.95): spam glazed with sweet chili sauce, fried egg, spring mix, Sriracha aioli on Macrina&apos;s mini brioche.

Our next course was a haphazard variety of our favorite-looking items on the menu, including the Park Cheesy Tots ($10.95): tator tots, cheese sauce, bacon, Sriracha aioli, crema, green onions, Happy Hour 1/2 order Park Nachos ($6): cheese, black olives, jalapenos, green onions, pico de gallo, black beans, guacamole, lime crema, and Happy Hour Taco Truck Tacos ($5): three with pork, chicken or veggie (all three must be the same).
 
Two orders for the Maple Bacon Burger ($14.95 each): maple bourbon-glazed bacon, roasted garlic cream cheese, lettuce, tomato completed the evening&apos;s selections.

What I loved: Above all, and most surprisingly, the Spam Sliders were easily the front-runner of our meal.

Why I loved it: A neighborhood eatery with no frills, perfect for accompanying children, and a limited, hard-working staff that worked their bottoms off serving the crowds in as timely a manner as possible on a busy evening.

Cost: Low to average ($10 - $14 per dinner entr√©e)","I really enjoyed the food here. I got a burger and salad and the salad had really strong flavorful cheese on it with a light dressing. 

But the service was awful. Drinks were never refilled, even though they were alcoholic and would have meant more money, and our waiter was just plain surly. This was Sunday night and there were a lot of families and maybe he was hungover. I would go back another night to see if it could be better. 

Food is great.","A weekday evening still ha good amount of people hanging out chatting. Some are playing pool. Nice pub environment, but not crazy or too noisy. and not too bad to find street parking. It was 8pm, but they still have kitchen food, such as salad, etc.","Have booked Park Public House for a couple of office parties and were very pleased.  They have a reasonable menu to pick from for food--we had salmon sliders, veggie quesadillas, salad, chips and guac and salsa, chicken wings (I think), and a bread pudding for dessert.  Since we had quite a few people they might have checked that the music was to our liking although we could have also spoken up when it got a little harsh for a bit.  The pool table is nice, too, and everyone loved the beer list.","What&apos;s the first thing you think of after a day at the zoo!? Grabbing a beer of course! OK perhaps not, but it was certainly on my mind after swarming through screaming children on a hot summer&apos;s day. 
In looking for the closest place with a cold one, we stumbled upon The Park and am so glad we did. Being that is was a Monday, we immediately noticed it was $6 burger and fries...ALL DAY! Honestly couldn&apos;t beat the price. Plus it was also happy hour so a $1 off beers and I was set. 
The burger overall was quite tasty. I will note that this is one of those places that does not cook their meat all the way through...so if you don&apos;t like to see some pink...just be aware to ask for it well done. The fries were delicious as well. Cooked fresh and with some garlic aoli it really hit the spot. After finishing not but half my meal I was already full. Portion size was good!

All in all I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Pool, darts, outdoor seating...all pluses. Friendly staff, plenty of TVs on the walls to watch sports. Plenty of good beers on tap and a full bar. Really can&apos;t complain about anything! 

Definitely recommend stopping in. Their HH menu is quite good.","I always love coming here, especially on game days, to grab some food and drinks with friends and family! The staff is super friendly and knows what&apos;s best for their customers. There are plenty of seats but it can be pretty crowded, again, especially on game days.

My all-time favorite thing to get on the menu is spam sliders! They are three tiny spam burgers with sriracha aioli and some greens. Very easy to eat, the spam is always fried to perfection, and there&apos;s barely any mess! I also like their omen drinks, especially the beast mode. I forgot what&apos;s in it, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s pineapple and vodka in there, but it&apos;s really good!

I also love that they started to serve brunch! I usually got the steak and eggs, I&apos;ve only gotten brunch once or twice I think. I always get mine cooked medium and the eggs over easy and it definitely met my expectations. If I remember correctly, it also comes with potatoes and fruits!

Can&apos;t wait to come here for another game day woooot!",Love the service. The food. The set up. Their fish and chips are done right. Beer batter is the way to go and I love they just being the malt vinegar our without even asking cause that&apos;s proper.,"Dont watch games here. With 7 min left in the Husky game against Oregon, with a 3 point lead, they changed the channel to the Georgia v Kentucky game with 2 min of warning. ?  Not enough time to go elsewhere. I blame them for the Oregon comeback. That loss is on you Park Pub.","Solid food and for the most part the staff was attentive.  I&apos;m pretty easy going at restaurants having worked in the industry and I was pleased with my experience here.  Owner goes above and beyond, and it&apos;s one of the few family friendly pubs in Seattle.","Best Greek food in America. Period. Growing up in Europe I had really really really missed good, authentic Greek food on the east and west coast until I stumbled upon Yanni&apos;s. Every single time we come to the Coachella valley, Yanni&apos;s is our first and last stop (especially during this pandemic we try to support this family-owned business as much as possible!)

Try their giant beans and their humus and their prawns! You&apos;re welcome!!!","Yanni&apos;s is awesome.  We got takeout the other night and the text alert said it would be 45min wait.  Ended up being only 20min, saweeeet!  I&apos;m Greek so have grown up eating Greek food a lot.  This place is legit, staff is very friendly, and they are playing it super covid safe.  Thanks guys!","I ordered wraps for pick up from the window. The food is incredible! Literally haven&apos;t had this good of a Greek food since roaming the streets in Athens, we were pleasantly surprised. We&apos;ve lived around here a while but this was the first time this year we tried it; I hope they do well during Covid so my family can become a frequent customer.","Ordered form here through Uber Eats and really enjoyed it! Of course it got expensive (as most deliveries do with fees and tips) but aside from that the value was decent. We got the egg lemon soup (this was a bit weird as it said $6 on the menu but then only allowed one size, &quot;regular&quot;, which added $3.50 to the $6) but it tasted really good! My boyfriend and I both got the chicken gyros - amazing tzatziki, lots of meat and veggies - and a good side portion (we got one salad and one fries). The fries and salad were both also really good! The one part I didn&apos;t love was that the chicken seasoning almost had a taco seasoning flavor to it. Would go or order again but would try something diff than the chicken due to the taco seasoning but overall we were happy with it and would recommend!","I have traveled by this restaurant on many occasions but they&apos;ve never been open at a time I wanted to have lunch there. I&apos;ve always had to go down the block to pub in order to enjoy a meal. 

However, the other day they happened to be open, and I had a chance to visit to see how it might meet my standards for tasty Greek foods.

It took the person serving me a bit of time to acknowledge me when I first arrived.   However, once she did everything was spot on with her customer service.  Oh, and I loved her accent and pronouncing the dishes natively.

The restaurant is spacious enough, seemingly clean enough, and had an OK ambiance. 

Menu choices seemed to be varied enough to please most people. However, at first glance there&apos;s nothing that jumps across as low carb or without sugar on the menu. 

The good news is my wait person was able to direct me to numerous things which didn&apos;t have sugar and/or were actually low carb if ordered with vegetables instead of the pita bread.

I ordered a red pepper type hummus.  I can&apos;t remember the name, and cucumbers with celery sticks, with a side of gyro meat.  I made my own little handheld bite size appetizers by putting the meat on top of the cucumbers with a dollop of the low carb hummus.   Was quite good!

I am often nearby in that neighborhood.  So, I&apos;m going to give the restaurant another try in the future just to make sure that I really liked it as much as I think I may have.","Great service, very friendly and no matter how often I visit, the food is fabulous.  This is a jewel.  Love this place",Ordered online for pickup. The food was ready 20+ minutes after they told me to arrive and while they kept me waiting outside the restaurant I never got a status update or an apology. Not worth it considering the food.,"We came in on a Thursday night at 7:00. It was not that busy. At 8:00, we still did not have our food. Tables that had sat after us had been served their dinners. We finally just asked for it to go, and we finally got it at 8:15, no explanation, no nothing. We will not be coming back.",Love this place! One of my favorites! I can&apos;t wait to come visit the next time I&apos;m in the area! I&apos;m a big fan of Greek food and this is one of my favorite places to get it. Thank you for the good food!,Had many gyros in my life and these are the best I&apos;ve ever had. The hummus was seasoned perfectly. This place is fantastic and deserves more love from Seattle.,"I had an amazing meal last night at this cute little place in Seattle. The food is great and the atmosphere is good, however there is something missing. I am originally Greek and I am used to experiencing the warmth of Greek hospitality. That part was missing given that the waiter took a really long time and take my order, and was not really attentive, while the place was not that busy. Also, he was quick to bring me my bill before asking if I wanted dessert and that left a really bad taste. Overall good good, but the service could improve a great deal.","So happy I stopped here for a much needed meal. I&apos;m not normally looking for Greek food but this place impressed me. 
They had very lovely Greek music for a nice atmosphere.
I had a special Pork Gyro that was excellent. Fresh Greek salad to accompany the marinated grill pork cutlet wrapped in a pitta. Well worth the price.","We&apos;ve lived in NYC, our family is part Greek, we&apos;ve eaten here for years, the food &amp; service continue to be excellent. Our favorite Greek restaurant in Seattle &amp; the US.","The food is delicious but way overpriced especially for the small servings.  It takes a long time to get your food. If you don&apos;t mind paying more or waiting then you&apos;ll enjoy the food.  6oz tzadziki is $8. $20.95 for chicken souvlaki, one small lemon potato and salad.","Food was alright but service could be better. 

They have a window setup for outside pick-up during coronavirus which I think is a great idea. The city is in phase 2 but the restaurant is still closed except for pick-up orders. I came up to the window and could see a lady at the opposite end of the restaurant at the cash register. She didn&apos;t acknowledge me for a few minutes so I just stood there. She then yelled across the restaurant but I was standing outside with cars driving by so I couldn&apos;t really hear. I popped my head in and she yelled across again asking for my name which I provided. Then nothing. I saw her talking to another individual behind the counter and I stood there for another 5-7 minutes with them not saying anything. Meanwhile two more people arrived and where in line behind me, still no one assisting. I had to pop my head into the window and ask if I would be helped. Only then did they immediately bring me my food and bill. I asked if there was a reason I wasn&apos;t being helped and she said the other gal was trying to cancel another order. Um, there are two of you. I would have been fine if someone came to the window, let me pay and then said it would be 5 minutes if that was the case. But I feel it was just bad service. I had been before prior to the pandemic and had a similar experience inside. 

As for the food it was mediocre. I ordered the beef souvlaki. The meat had a gamy taste to it and was tough. I had a few pieces and fed the rest to my dog. Too bad as I love Mediterranean food and was disappointed. 

Between the bad service and the food, I won&apos;t be returning. It&apos;s unfortunate as I prefer to support local small business like this.","A local gem! Food is terrific, but the service is even better! These are the types of places that deserve our support during these times! Great deals on take out wine, cash deals, top notch service, yummy food. Buy a bottle of Greek wine, get some take out, and pretend you have taken a trip to Greece without leaving your couch!","Friendly and fast service with a large selection of food. Overall a positive experience, however food was a bit under-seasoned and overpriced (but we are in Seattle ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø). Not a restaurant to be particularly passionate about, but good enough.",This time around I had the lamb burger and it was outstanding. Perfectly prepared with very tasty fries. The service was excellent and wait person (Ella I think) was very helpful and welcoming. I highly recommend Yanni&apos;s as everything I&apos;ve experienced has been a delight.,"This restaurant has the most incredible and authentic Greek food.  The staff are friendly and attentive.

I highly recommend Yanni&apos;s.","Overall a good experience with food that matched the freshness.  I am not a huge fan of Green food, but my wife likes it.  I would not mind going back as it had all the little elements that made the food tastier than I had at other Greek restaurants","This is pretty typical of what you&apos;d expect from a food court at a zoo: overpriced fast food. I only ate here because I was attending a company outing and the food was expensed. There are plenty of amazing restaurants in the area that you can dine at before coming to the zoo. But hey, if you have hungry kids, or all of Fremont burned down and this was the only restaurant left in the area, this would be a quick and easy solution.

Rain Forest Food Pavilion has a decent variety of dishes ranging from fresh made pizza to impossible burgers to paninis. There&apos;s even a coffee shop in the back! 

I got a chicken and bacon panini with a side of fries and a order of hummus with veggies. The panini was large and nicely grilled with plenty of chicken. The chicken tasted like leftover rotisserie bits, which had a stale flavor to it. I do wish there was a little more tomato sauce to balance out the chicken and the brie cheese (I&apos;m a sucker for brie). The fries could&apos;ve been more crispy, but at least it was fresh. The hummus and veggies was nothing special. It came prepackaged in a cup.

Probably won&apos;t come back to eat here unless it was free again.","This place seems to have improved and all my guest seemed satisfied with their food. I ordered the cornbread waffle which was about $6 and I was pleasantly surprised with how delightful it was. The flavor was great and the syrup and maple butter topped it off. 

My friend was vegan and ordered the mushroom pizza. It took the longest to prepare but she said it was delicious. The waffle fries were hot and fresh. I have to say though, that the menu was not very clear on what was vegetarian and what was vegan. An Burger item said &quot;vegan grain&quot; but it was not vegan. 

To top things off, there was dip n dots in here! That was one of the highlights of my day.","We visited Woodland Zoo on a Monday which greatly helped with crowds. It felt like there weren&apos;t that many people at the zoo throughout the whole day. When we got to Rain Forest I think there were only 5 or 6 tables being used with no lines for food. 

I had the double cheeseburger and it was not bad. The prices aren&apos;t the cheapest and I&apos;m sure they do it because they&apos;re basically the only restaurant place inside the zoo. Pacific Chowder wasn&apos;t nearly as big / nice and it was outdoor seating only. 

I&apos;d be hesitant to visit the zoo on the weekend.","My boyfriend &amp; I decided to stop by the RFFP as a quick break while we were at the zoo. We went around 1 pm. It was SUPER packed inside. I think it was really busy just because it was Sunday &amp; lunch hour too. 

Interior: 
Inside was spacious. I was able to find a table quickly but I could imagine that some would find it hard to find a table if it was even more packed than it was today for me. There are several other food courts in there to choose from.

Exterior:
I was going to sit outside since it was lovely weather but the tables are really dirty with bird poop everywhere or birds staring at you waiting for a chance to steal your food haha. 

Let&apos;s get to the food part now! I ordered the Clam Chowder Bread Bowl &amp; my boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger with a BBQ sauce inside with a side of waffles fries, onion rings &amp; a soda drink. In my opinion the clam chowder was okay, not too bad but the bread was kind of hard &amp; didn&apos;t taste that good. The clam chowder bowl was about $9-10, I would say the bread bowl isn&apos;t worth it so just get the clam chowder. My boyfriend said his burger was good &amp; his onion rings were crispy but his waffle fries were soggy. His combo meal was around $11. 

Final verdict: 
We both say this place isn&apos;t too bad to eat at as long as you&apos;re not expecting extraordinary food. It&apos;s mainly geared for little kids since they&apos;re most familiar with these types of food. It wasn&apos;t too expensive either. The only drawback I saw at this food court was how it wasn&apos;t the cleanest because most of the tables were sticky or covered with crumbs of food from previous customers. There should be more servers to clean up inside &amp; outside tables. Second con is the long wait line as well. 
So I would give a 3/5 *","Decent food. Fries and pretzel were nice and salty, however, we wanted the hummus plate and they were out. Disappointing. I like that I can drink beer at the zoo though.","As far as Food Court/Pavillions go at a place like the zoo, this place is da &apos;bomb!

Where can you buy a giant icee (slushee) and get free refills on a hot day?  Here!

Where can you find a variety of kids&apos; meals sure to please the pickiest of kids?  Here!

Where can you find TONS of tables, with air conditioning, to eat even if you only brought your own food?  Here!

Where can you get a variety of items from paninis to pizzas to waffle cut fries?  Here!

So basically, I have never been to a better food courtish like option at a BUSY place like the zoo!

The floor to ceiling windows and tons of natural light let you see and enjoy everything happening around you.  

The washrooms were plenty, clean, and had change tables!

And there were videos playing wtih animal facts - like did you know that Gorillas co-sleep and breastfeed typically until around the age of 4!  

LOVE love LOVED the Woodland Park Zoo and the Rain Forest Food Pavillion will definitely be my regular stop in the future :-)

See you later Alligator!

P.S. Yes, prices are high, it is the zoo... but definitely cheaper than say DisneyLand food ;-)

P.P.S.  If you like garlic, try the garlic fries!  SO Garlicy good!  It will definitely keep the vampire bats away ;-)","If you absolutely must eat because you forgot to pack a snack, the food pavilion is will save you. If you can wait until you leave the zoo, Phinney / Greenwood Ave have much better options. The &quot;safe&quot; fried staple items like waffle fries are . Everything else is overpriced for what you get. I can&apos;t recall why I placed an order for their Seattle Dog. Anyway, check the photo for an idea of what you&apos;ll get. This was the first time where appearance actually affected my appetite.","The foods are 8-15$ which is quite expensive for what it is. I got a double cheeseburger Combo for 15$. The burger was quite good, but the fries were cold and tasteless. My sister got one of their bacon flat bread, and it was cold too. The drink that come with it was a small cup. The bread was thick and soggy from lots of tomatoes sauce on it. My 2 kids who normally can finish a large Papa murphy pizza could not finish the small flat bread from here since they did not like it.

Overall, it was not bad considering it&apos;s just a restaurant in a zoo. I would recommend their burger not any of the flat bread. Buying food at prime location like zoo, airports or theme park is expensive. Set the right expectation so you won&apos;t be so disappoint.",This is a great Zoo. It is too bad who ever is running their food service is completely inept and should be run out of town. Not only are the workers rude but they have no idea how to basic hospitality functions. It was embarrassing to witness having been in hospitality for over 25 years,"The Rain Forest Food Pavilion is the food court located inside Woodland Park Zoo. Typically food courts aren&apos;t overly impressive, but this one is actually pretty legit. There&apos;s a ton of seating, both inside and outside. They offer a fairly large menu with a wide variety of options for the entire family. Vegetarian options are labeled on the menu. 

Service is quick and friendly. Not exactly a destination spot, but if you&apos;re already in the zoo it&apos;s definitely not a bad option.","I feel like writing about amazing food at a zoo food court is supposed to be against the rules...like discovering amazing art in a bathroom or something. But I digress, this place was a knock it out of the park find that left all of us very surprised and satisfied!

Large seating areas, including a ton outside. It&apos;s basically split into a pizza line and everything else. They have a surprising array of offerings here, from some really good salads and paninis to the standard burgers and hot dogs. The sandwiches we had were crazy good for a spot like this and were more than ample in size. Plus, they only ran around $8 - it was cheaper than going out to a sandwich shop in town and just as good! We had a chicken apple salad with produce from over the mountains and it was tasty!

Pizza slices were huge and something kiddos can split - another thing we&apos;re not used to finding at spots like this.

Overall, this was an incredible place to grab lunch and it didn&apos;t break the bank. They run things very efficiently and had some really nice offerings. Lines were a little long, but not unruly. Definitely worth checking out when you&apos;re meandering around the zoo!","The Rain Forest Food Pavilion is located in the middle of the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. It is basically a cafeteria in amongst the exhibits on the west side of the zoo itself. 

The Rain Forest Food Pavilion has a large communal seating area and contains five different &quot;restaurants&quot;: 
1) Corner Pizza sells pizza by the slice and ICEE&apos;s
2) World Taco, with what you might expect 
3) Market Grill harbors burgers, fries, hot dogs, onion rings
4) Woodland Deli boasts freshly made sandwiches, salads, soups and entrees
5) Zoo Java has espresso, smoothies, ice cream, cookies, popcorn, and pretzels

As you can probably tell, the establishments in the pavilion are very much catered towards kids and their taste in food, along with a little something for the adults in tow. As a family, we had opted for a burger with homemade potato chips, garlic fries, waffle fries, mac and cheese, a Korean taco and a cherry ICEE to wash it down. As a very pleasant surprise, the trophy Wife brought a Cheese Panini with Bacon Jam and potato salad, which might be the single best panini that I&apos;ve ever had! I&apos;m not against paying zoo admission again just for another one of those!

Overall, the food was actually quite good, for cafeteria food. The homemade potato chips were also a stand-out for me. They were warm and crisp but I would have liked a side of dipping sauce of some sort. The garlic fries were also very nice and the portion was more than enough for the four of us. 

It was unfortunate that the mac and cheese was basically Kraft dinner. Granted, it was cooked well and my seven year-old daughter was happy, but for $6, Daddy wasn&apos;t quite as impressed. Also FYI, straws are not available, apparently due to the danger factor for the animals at the zoo. Initially, I was annoyed at this and thought it was a bit of overkill, but after thinking about it, I completely understand and support the zoo in their decision to keep trash as minimal as possible and protect the animals from any potential hazards.

I really liked the fact that if you buy an ICEE, free refills are available at the self-serve machine. Four ICEE&apos;s kind of made up for the pricey mac and cheese. 

The pavilion has TV screens that advertised the zoo and had facts on many different animals, which I thought was a very nice touch, while providing information on the activists and the conservation of these various animals.

The men&apos;s room was nice, clean and big and had a little bench for tired fathers that don&apos;t necessarily want to stand at the urinal with their little wrangler.

I would definitely take in the Rain Forest Food Pavilion again, and urge anybody to partake in the Rain Forest Food Pavilion&apos;s goodness, and not just because it happens to be on the zoo property. The experience was quite good and I give it a solid four stars.","After going here twice over the last year, I believe they have changed their menu selection. I thought they had more vegetarian options before, but I would enjoy seeing some in the future. The onion rings there were pretty over done, but the fries were done pretty well. They have almost ball park prices for food and drink, but at least here your money goes to the park as well as restocking the shelves, so at least your money is going to a good cause. The waits can be a little long during the busy days, but they stay pretty organized with delivery. Would still return, but I would pay a premium for a vegan or veggie Chicago dog.","Food and service were both terrible today. We&apos;ve eaten here in the past and the food was always hot and edible, service quick and friendly. Nothing fancy. Today my vegetarian burger was cold and wet (yes wet). The party was waterlogged and falling apart. The waffle fries were plentiful but bland, cold and hard. They forgot one of our sandwiches and had a hard time understanding what they missed and how to make up for it. They finally subbed it with a smaller sandwich rather reluctantly.
Kids Mac n cheese was a tiny bowl of shell pasta cooked in cream, it had no flavor. 
The only thing good was their pizza. 
Not worth shelling out so much money for such awful food, unless all you want is pizza and ice cream.","Your typical attraction food court with burgers, pizza and fries. Drinks are extra expensive ($4 for medium soda).",Not good food.  Everything was way too salty except for the fries which didn&apos;t have any.  Everything was 2x expensive as it should have been.  Giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the staff was pretty good for the most part,If it&apos;s a busy day be prepared for long lines and cold food with embarrassingly slow turn around time for your food.  What can you expect for inflated prices and a mismanaged food service though.  I&apos;ll pack a sandwich next time.,"This is barely on par with a middle school cafeteria at 4 times the price. The pizza is like those $5 pizza specials from a guy driving around in a truck, except the only give you one piece. The hot dogs cost the same as in the stadium but are overly steamed to kept warm and the bread is gross.","I was really impressed by some of the smells coming from the pavilion when I walked in to use the restroom. Sadly, the taste did not live up to the anticipation. My wife had the pizza, and it tasted like microwaveable pizza, which is not terrible if I&apos;m on the couch in my undies playing some Xbox. But for a nice family outing at a zoo and for $7 I expected a little bit more. I had the chickie and waffle. The chicken was delicious. I highly suggest it. The waffle was delicious I&apos;m sure...three days ago, when they made it fresh. Today, the waffle was stale, hard, and cold. I do not highly suggest it. In fact I suggest staying away from it at all cost. The staff was also a bit blas√© to be polite. They seemed way less than thrilled to be there, which I totally understand because hey, it&apos;s work! But come on, try to fake it a little. I mean, a fraction of a second of eye contact would be better than the comatose stare into the abyss I got from many of them.","For a zoo of this size, the dining area was incredibly small! Tables came at a premium, so if you came in a group of more than four, finding an open table would be tricky. You might have to settle for the standing tables across the walkway, but even so, there are very few of those.

Not only that, but there are no straws or lids for the cups, so you have to be very careful in carrying your drinks. I actually almost tripped a couple times near the order counter because the ground was sharply uneven. Luckily, I was able to get to my table without spilling anything, but I can definitely see myself spilling something in future visits.

I ordered the Wild Salmon Flatbread, which was a piece of salmon with shredded lettuce and tartar sauce on top of flatbread. It was only okay at best mainly because the salmon was too dry for my liking! It felt like it was sitting on a plate for 15 minutes before it was finally served to me. Not only that, but the menu said that all entrees (with the exception of corn dog) come with waffle fries. I didn&apos;t get any waffle fries! What gives???

I also got a cup of clam chowder, which was quite decent, but nothing out of the ordinary. It came with a small bag of oyster crackers.

Service was about average. The cashiers exhibited pretty decent customer service. However, nobody kept an eye on the trash! It kept filling up, and by the time I was done with my meal, it was a challenge to put my trash in the trash bin without having to touch the other trash. Blegh!!! Someone must have blown their trash duty assignment big time!

If you&apos;re going to stay at the zoo through‚Äã lunch time, I would suggest either bringing your own lunch and enjoying it in the grass by the West entrance or going to the Rain Forest Food Pavilion instead. I would only recommend eating here if A) the Rain Forest Food Pavilion is too crowded and congested, B) the east side of the zoo is not as busy, and C) you&apos;re not ordering more than you can carry.","Hoping for good chicken corn chowder, more like a chicken corn chili, disappointing. The churro was the only decent part of the experience here, love the zoo but the food is too expensive and disappointing. Bring your own food, save money and overall sadness.","Express lane for pretzel, ice cream or soda. I purchased a pretzel and cheese for $4.25.  Long line for full menu.  Clean and comfortable seating area. They filled my Starbucks cup with ice and water for free   I wish there was a hand washing station for sanitary reasons. If there was one I did not see it. Employees very friendly.","This place is horrible, we stopped to order hot dog and fries with a cup of chowder and soda. Fries were not fresh, not even crispy, hot dog was the only decent thing but it also was small too, the chowder WAS HORRIBLE.

NOT THICK AT ALL, runny, salty, barely any clams and it was sad. Sad meal on a beautiful day at the zoo. So disappointed. =(

Not only that, the cashier was this young lady and she had like boogers all hanging out the edge of her nose. It was gross and it made me want to vomit the acid in my stomach and made the meal even more unappealing. I mean if she has allergies, wipe often, I mean, come on now, people are trying to eat there, not feel sick before they get their food. =(

Nice people, but sad food.

No straws btw or lids provided, not sure if thats because they are being conservative for the earth which I don&apos;t mind or they run out. 

Good luck!",I&apos;m unsure why there are so many negative reviews. They made our food very fast. We had a chicken caesar salad and fish tacos. Both were delicious and great considering it is zoo food.,"The menu is fairly pricey, and we waited for 20 minutes after placing our order for our food to be ready. Considering that it&apos;s a walk up joint we expected service to be a bit faster. Sadly the food didn&apos;t live up to the wait. The Mahi Mahi tacos were lukewarm, and while the flavor was good the pieces of fish were tiny. Similar to unbreaded fish sticks, with 1 piece per taco. The bread bowl for the clam chowder was more like a bread loaf with a small hole. We got maybe 5 bites of chowder  before all that was left was bread, but at least the soup was hot. Pretty disappointing for almost $10!","Saw the bad reviews and ordered a cheeseburger, figuring they couldn&apos;t mess that up. One side of the party was burnt to a crisp. Yuck. Waffle fries weren&apos;t much better: stiff, dry, &amp; hard, like they&apos;d been freezer burned. under-seasoned too. 

Caesar wasn&apos;t bad for a snack shack: fresh lettuce etc.. Quick service, and the staff offered free water cups, so they dug out 2 stars despite the char.

Watch that grill.","Stopped here for a snack while spending the day at the zoo. Got a pretzel and a soda. The pretzel was tasted like your standard crappy mall pretzel. They had burgers (and chowder!) available but the food was expensive and none of it looked too appetizing. Eat before/after you visit the zoo.

The lines are pretty terrible (slow), but that probably has more to do with the dazed parents staring blankly at the menu while their children yell. The kitchen staff all looked like all they could think about was how much they hated their jobs, but this might just be me projecting. If I had to spend my day serving soft serve ice cream (with flavor burst!) to dirty, screaming little children I&apos;d probably try to drown myself in soda.","This is, hands down, the best place to eat at the Zoo. The regular food court is out-of-date ---- it needs to get a shot of the Armory&apos;s medicine. But the Pacific Blue Chowder House has solid showings in the chowder and sandwich arenas. I wouldn&apos;t hit this up on the street but if you gotta eat at the zoo, do it here.  It&apos;s buried back in the park and seating is outdoors so you&apos;ll have to brave the elements. I suggest any of the chowders and the salmon BLT, which they grill to order.",I&apos;d recommend an ice cream cone on a very hot day.  Otherwise... not worth the price as the quality of food is very poor and certainly not healthy.  This establishment is taking advantage of it&apos;s captive audience of zoo goers.,"It was hot that day at the zoo, and it was packed. We had dinner plans that evening, so we just wanted a small lunch. The Pacific Blue Chowder House was right up the path, doing a bang-up business (dozens of kids with neon-striped soft ice cream were walking away with cones as big as their heads). We ordered cups of traditional clam chowder, knowing the high prices were because we were a captive audience. The wait wasn&apos;t too long, but the chowder was a sludgy, gray disappointment. I think they forgot all of the cream and most of the clams! The only flavors were potatoes and flour, with a clam (albeit tender) now and then. The lines were to long to take the chowder back, so we forced it down. It was edible, just not very good. The flavors weren&apos;t bad, so I think it had potential, but that texture and color were ALL wrong.","Great to-go service and packaging. Ordered an Eggs Benedict this morning, was done perfectly! Been here many times for brunch/lunch during non-Covid times, never disappoints.","Just ordered breakfast this morning for the first time and I usually don&apos;t order delivery but decided to treat ourselves this morning and boy was it the best decision I made! I had The eggs Benedict and it was so good my kids ate all their breakfast and also bites of mine but thank goodness I ordered the French toast too because they ended up eating almost all my meal. The red potatoes were just right, crunchy and seasoned perfectly. I would definitely order again!!!","My friends and I all liked their brunch. The portion was huge and the scone is very buttery! 

One thing we noticed is that the waiter was a little bit impatient when we were still waiting for one more friend to arrive. She came to our table 3 times to ask for order while we were still waiting for our friend. Right when our friend arrived, she came to us again and asked us if we were ready to order. I guess it&apos;d be great for the staff to wait a little bit longer. They have a lot of tasty options and we just need some time to read through the menu. ;)",Looked up bloody mary and this place popped up. We drove 16 min to check it out and my wife and I have to say great place and outstanding food with a fantastic bloody Mary. Service was impeccable. Thank you Blue Star Cafe!!!,"HUGE breakfast portions,
And fresh squeezed orange juice.
You&apos;ve gotta try the potatoes,
There&apos;s just no excuse!","Can we just appreciate the size of this cinnamon roll?! If you want your craving fix this is the thing to get. I love me a good cream cheese frosting and raisins that add texture to the pastry. But be warned of how dangerous it is, Was planning to spread this out to a few days of eating, but ended up finishing it in one day...","Got there about 10:30 Sunday and were fortunate to be able to get a nice table pretty quickly!
The service was just right. Keeping our beverages full, making sure we had everything we needed, yet non intrusive in our conversations.  
5 for service 
But the food was tasty as well...
On our table was a perfectly made vegetable omelette,
Breakfast tacos, morning hash, French toast.... and a lot of  bacon!!!   The Bloody Marys were enjoyed equally as well!!
Very little left on our table... a definite place to return to when in the area!!!","Very disappointed! Usually stellar breakfasts, I was served something the cook/chef should have been truly embarrassed to send out! It&apos;s gotta be hard to screw up Bacon and Eggs but I got bottom of the barrel and only the eggs were freshly cooked. Won&apos;t be ever going back!","3 stars is the best we can give. We&apos;ve had good experiences here before. Breakfast burrito was fine, but the chicken and waffles is just a waste. One frozen eggs waffle (not one of the Belgian waffles shown in the pictures) and 3 little frozen chicken tenders. The gravy on the side was fine, but really, this shouldn&apos;t even be called chicken and waffleS--when I only received one wimpy waffle. We will not order this again, but would be willing to try something else.","Used them twice through door dash and both times were great.  Had a giant cinnamon roll that was nearly the size of my head.  It was the biggest one I ever had.  This was meal by itself. Also had the crepes with poached eggs and sausage.  All was perfect with the meal.  The last thing I had was a crispy chicken burger and fries.  Man that burger was huge and tasty.  The fries were good but I honestly had better 

One thing they could do better is with packaging.  Some places have been doing packaging that makes it obvious that your food has been messed up.  My meal was in bag tied in a knot.  The driver could have ate some of fries and retied the bag.  I doubt that happen but a different method liked sealed plastic or paper bags stapled at the top would be better.   I often buy from a food truck that uses a bag sealer.  The bad can be easily opened but you would know it was open.  I didn&apos;t remove a point for this just something to note if you are ordering online.","The food here is fine, but my main concern is with the staff. I am shocked at the way the hostess specifically treats delivery drivers when they show up for pickup. I came to grab breakfast twice and witnessed her treating people coming to pick up delivery orders terribly, barking orders at them and gesturing rudely. During a global pandemic like this, the people who are accepting pathetically small fees to deliver food and help those who need to stay at home to keep all of us safe should be treated respectfully and even gratefully. Without the people driving delivery, cafes like this would not even be able to do much business. I am positive that some of the people driving delivery are doing this thankless job because they were laid off because of the pandemic. It is truly shameful for the Blue Star staff to be treating delivery drivers like this, and I will no longer be giving them my business and I am going to discourage friends from ordering from there, too.","Visiting from Cali and was staying close. So here we are and this is AMAZING!!!!! 
The biscuits and gravy was so flavorful, very fluffy and moist biscuits. The potatoes are probably my favorite EVER!!!! 
The eggs Benedict is absolutely out of this world!!!! The fresh shaved ham is unbelievable and the mixture of the sauce and potatoes was very flavorful. 
For sure my new FAVORITE eggs benny",I have a 3 star cause typically I like their food. I would have given less otherwise. I have ordered from here a lot but the last two times I have requested a Gluten Free bun and they have not given me GF. They either changed their gf option or they are not giving me what I request.,"If you&apos;re looking for a decent breakfast, large menu, and friendly staff then this is the place to go! I have only been for breakfast or brunch so I cannot speak to their lunch or dinner menu but they have a large menu with lots of breakfast items. They have pretty good coffee and the prices aren&apos;t too bad. The place is also large so it can seat a lot of people.","The restaurant has a few sitting areas which all are different.  We sat in a booth.  We stayed with Amazing Bloody Mary&apos;s and I will return just to have another one or two!  Our breakfasts were solid with a lot of bacon and the biscuits were large and satisfying.  

We will be back for the Bloody Marys!","Standard greasy spoon, came for the Bloody Mary&apos;s, which didn&apos;t end up being worth it. Mix was salty and lacked flavor regardless of how many toppings sauces were added. Benedict was okay, but nothing memorable.","Nice local pub with decent food and extensive bar offerings. Leisurely service (not a place to go if you are in a rush) is pleasant and helpful. Best potato home fries served with their omelets. Extensive breakfast menu, nice variety of lunch options. Nice size portions.",One of my favorite places to go for breakfast in Seattle. Their pancakes are perfect! Definitely recommend.,"Don&apos;t order for a later time for takeout. I have tried this twice and both times they made it ASAP and then it sat around because I couldn&apos;t get there fast enough. When I mentioned it to them, they just shrugged.","It wasn&apos;t difficult to get seating for 8 on a Sunday morning. The staff was nice and on top of keeping us happy. We ordered a cinnamon roll for the table which was a good idea, they are huge! And very good, with the raisins that so many places leave out. We had two people order chicken and waffles, but the gravy wasn&apos;t quite the usual country gravy so they didn&apos;t use that much. I ordered the Hobo potatoes or something like that, it doesn&apos;t appear to be on their regular menu but it was very good! Their wheat bread is very nutty and seed ridden, so if you&apos;re not a fan of that kind of wheat bread, fair warning. I liked the vibe of the restaurant, I can see how it easily transitions from breakfast/brunch crowds to football and beer crowds.","My absolute favorite bar for football. 

They are proudly a football bar, not a Seahawks bar, so if you are a fam of another team you can always catch your game. 

And the big screen and sound is always on hawks. So great for hawks fans as well.","My friend is a regular here and invited a group of us to watch the Zags play during March Madness. Read some of the reviews and was kind of skeptical but if my friend likes it, I definitely trust his opinion--so I gave it a shot! 

I had no expectations for the bar food but the mini corn dogs and chickens wings were appetizing! Great combo to pair with a pitcher of beer. Chicken wings are easy to mess up, but Bleachers has some AMAZING wings! Crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Can&apos;t go wrong with corn dogs. But holy smokes!!! The chocolate lava cake, in my opinion, is by far the best I&apos;ve had here in Seattle. You&apos;ll want to check that out.

Here during HH and not badly priced if you ask me! Managed to spend under $30 here for food and drinks compared to other sports bars. 

I love how many TVs are in here, plus all the open seating! Honestly, if I lived closer I think I would hangout here a lot with my friends. 

ALSO, shoutout to Katie, the bartender who was working on Thursday afternoon, YOU ROCK. You held down the fort on your own and major thanks to the kitchen staff for feeding us.","I used to like bleachers when they were down the street and had a big bank of TV&apos;s. you could watch any sport you like. now they are totally baseball and football. I like to watch the sounders but the last couple of times I came in to watch a match I would ask and get insulted for liking soccer by the bouncer and the patrons. three screens in front of the bar all the same game and no sounders. wtf? good luck staying afloat years when the mariners, seahawks and huskies suck. this location was way better when it was Bills. you could bring your family in. when they opened in this site as bleachers they actually advertised to welcome families. it didn&apos;t take long for all the families to get scared away. the food is ok though","Was visiting from out of town and was looking for a good sports bar to watch a game at. When I arrived I was greeted immediately and was given a drink. From there is went downhill. The whole bar was staffed by 2 bar tenders who were working hard but was impossible to serve everyone and keep the areas clean.  Took a while to get food order in and receive after.  A guy that was drinking in the crowd would change TV channels (assuming owner/other worker). When I asked him to change a channel he said he couldn&apos;t because they didn&apos;t have that channel...... 30 minutes later one of the locals asked for the channel and he jumped up to change it immediately. There are 7 TVs in the bar area and I asked for the corner TV that no one was watching. 
Food was good but nothing spectacular. 
Overall was unimpressed.",It&apos;s great if you&apos;re looking for a modest sports bar with sports bar stuff and sports bar drinks and sports bar TVs.,"Be prepared to miss a quarter or two of your game. This is in my neighborhood and aFter enjoying the old Bleachers many times I really wanted to make this my regular sports bar. It definitely has the sports theme, if only they actually cared about sports.

This was my second day in a row when I sat among several people decked out in UW Huskies gear basically begging the staff to put the UW game on. They seem to be consistently understaffed, whether it is packed, as it was in my last visit, or, perhaps understandably, relatively slow as it was this time. Combine the lack of staff, the low concern about the biggest local sports events, and the way modern games are bounced around different stations, and you have virtually no hope of seeing the whole game (letting alone actually being able to hear it. 

I don&apos;t expect all servers in a putative sports bar to be big sports fans, but I do expect the management to have them prepared for the larger local events, and for them to at least seem to care about their theme -- particularly when half their customers are plainly dressed for a particular game. 

Bleachers can be a pleasant little neighborhood joint with standard pub fare and a nice clientele. It can still be a reasonable choice as long as you aren&apos;t looking for anything fancy and don&apos;t care too much about seeing a game. But I&apos;m a sports fan so it&apos;s really not for me.","So I dont live close but my wife was getting a haircut in the area and i was along for the ride. Came in and had the nost attentive service i have ever had. The bartender (wish i would have gotten her name) was by far the best i have ever seen. Knew the names of the patrons coming in and had their drinks ready. Gave me a complete cheers vibe. Plus the 1.50 tacos on Tuesday were awesome. Pulled a tab and won $125. How could you dislike this place, simply one of the best experiences you could ask for.","Before I ever wandered in, this place was described to me as the dive-iest of dives. Because of that, I didn&apos;t really bother with it for quite some time. I like dives, but it was kind of given a bad rap. 

When I went to observe on my own, I found that it really wasn&apos;t THAT divey at all. It&apos;s a simple, cheap sports bar. I like it because the beer prices are cheap, you can get pretty lit up without worrying too much about spending a fortune or looking like a fool. It&apos;s also nice to have some pool tables and dart boards around.",There is only one employee here on a Sat night. We are trying to play the jute box and order food. But it will never happen. So we&apos;re leaving.,"For a place that calls its self a sports bar this place really missed the mark. 

I will say that it is nice you can bring your family in. Probably the only high light. 

Came in for the MLS cup final, and walked into a packed house (sounds good so far right). Come to find out there I only 1 bartender and 1 cook working. You&apos;d think for a sports pub they would have staffed up for a Seattle sporting event. Especially if it&apos;s a game that could win a title. 

Was told it would take an hr and a 1/2 to get burgers and fries. Really!! Decided to just grab some chips from the Safeway down the street.  

After more staffed showed up tried to order again. Only this time being told they were out of burgers. Not very good management if you ask me. I get that a place will run out of food, but when you&apos;re a sports pub and a Seattle team is vying for a title you should have things better sorted out. 

Probably not going to be going back for another sporting event, regular season or post.","Liked it.  Came in with friends to have a beer, a little food, and to watch basketball.","I&apos;ve come to this place on many Tuesdays for their FREE Bingo that starts at 7pm. Everyday they do a drink special that will go on until supplies last and the tacos on Tuesday are $1.50 (as a tip - the soft tacos go faster than the hard shell). They have had many great food specials of the day and one that I can remember is their &quot;Totchos&quot; which are nachos but instead of chips, they use tots. It satisfied my hunger for sure.

Half of the establishment is family friendly while the bar area is 21+. They welcome children and often times you will see families here even on Bingo night. The wait staff is very courteous in helping with selecting the sports channel of your choice on one of the many screens that they have. A thing I&apos;ve noticed is that they have a lot of regulars and they are very nice. One couple invited us to a game of darts and they brought their own fancy darts that they let us use.

I have been coming here even when they were at their older location and this location is much brighter.  As a note for those who haven&apos;t been to the new location... they no longer have pool tables.  They have shuffleboard, two dart boards and a jukebox though.  The staff informed me that next door has pool tables.  I love coming here weekly and highly recommend it.","Worst service ever. Ordered pizza, took over an hour and 20 min to get it, we were told that it was going to be discounted and then got 2 dollars off our check. Certainly never coming back","If you want to drink and watch the game, you&apos;ll be fine. Don&apos;t count on food though. Our food orders were consistently screwed up or forgotten. Wait staff tried but seemed you be stymied by the kitchen.","Kind of a douchey little joint. Every time I&apos;ve been here someone tries to start a fight toward the end of the night after drinking more than they can handle. Typical jock bar.
I avoid this place like I avoid the U-district.","I&apos;ve been searching Seattle for a place that has great nachos served with cheese sauce. Found it! Definitely the best nachos I&apos;ve had since moving here... and I&apos;ve had quite a few. The nachos at Bleachers normally come with either beef or chicken, but I asked to substitute chili instead. Delicious! I could envision myself gaining serious weight if I lived close to Bleachers.

But that aside, I wasn&apos;t too impressed with the service. The place felt understaffed. There was one period where I didn&apos;t see anyone who worked there for about 10 minutes. I imagine they were doing prep work or something in the back. They were gone so long, that one couple came in, sat down, looked around uncomfortably for a while, then got frustrated and left without the staff ever seeing them. 

And back to the good things! There is a wall of over 10 screens with one huge projector screen in the middle. They were showing football, baseball, and Ultimate Fighting. Look to the wall to the left of the huge projector screen and you&apos;ll see a large whiteboard with the important upcoming games. 

Surprisingly as well, Bleachers was clean. There was a fresh smell to the place, which I didn&apos;t expect at all.","My husband and I love Bleachers for what it is: An unpretentious neighborhood sports bar with strong drinks and good food. They have one giant screen in addition to at least ten other monitors so you can likely catch whichever game you&apos;re interested in. (If there&apos;s a Sounders, Seahawks, or Mariners game, that will likely take precedence on the big screen.) Drinks are priced reasonably and most bartenders there have a delightfully heavy hand. 

In terms of food, our standard order is the Bleacher Burger (double cheese burger with bacon) and Chili Cheese Fries. You can get your burger on garlic bread buns (highly recommended!) and it has become one of my favorite burgers in Seattle. The Chili Cheese Fries are topped with meaty chili, bacon, scallions, and nacho cheese. If you like your chili cheese fries without fresh-grated cheese (and I do!), these are the best. We often get their buffalo wings too which are meaty and delicious. Just a warning, medium spicy is pretty spicy and my mouth burns when I forget to order mild and order medium instead. They have one main cook whose name I don&apos;t know, but the food is excellent when he makes it (and good, just not nearly as good when it&apos;s a different cook). Look for the tall, thin (bald?) guy... If you&apos;re just looking for a snack, they have free popcorn available. Two tips: Skip the nachos and clarify salad ingredients (may contain cheese or onions without being explicitly stated on the menu). 

If you&apos;re looking for a big crowd (and long wait for food), go on a Seahawks game day. If you&apos;re going during the week, Tuesday&apos;s are great for the free bingo! See you there!","Food has the comfort of bar food, but is sit-down restaurant quality.  You can also watch the chef prepare your food.  There are plenty of tvs dedicated to every kind of sport.   

Service is a little spotty.  The bartender seemed more concerned with counting the stock and performing administrative tasks rather than serving the customers.  A couple came in, sat themselves, waited 10 minutes, and left without ever being acknowledged and the bartender didnt notice.","Food is alright and the service could be a lot better. I spent 21 dollars on two beers and chicken strips that I watched the bartender pull out of a mini freezer. With that said, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be going back.","Laid back atmosphere, clean, lots of TVs which is good. The food was tasty and quick to arrive. Service was good as well!","Fantastic Service! We were made to feel right at home. Well spaced tables, covid procedures followed to a T! We enjoyed the in house Country Fried Steak and Amazing Challah Cinnamon French Toast. I think we found the new Beth&apos;s! I saw Onion Rings as big as your fist arrive at another table. Can&apos;t wait to go back again! Go, read their menu! 3 eggs! Who does that? North Star does!","Why didn&apos;t i find this place earlier?! I loved their space themed deco and the funky patio. Tony was super friendly! He even offered to morph my picture into the astronaut wall of fame! I had the vegetable hash as snack. Like how they had the spicy mayo around the edge which gave the root vegetables a kick. Keep it up with the space force amid pandemic. One day when you see some asian female astronaut on the wall, you then know what&apos;s up lol","I stepped in here the day before all the restaurants were ordered to close due to COVID-19. Sat down at the counter, and ordered french fries. Ate them one by one, squeezing a line of ketchup along each one as I did so. The fries are tasty. Not sure if they are housemade or not, but they are robust and you literally do get one pound. I took the rest home and ate them later. A pleasant final meal in a restaurant for a while.","I used to be a big fan of this place until today. If you are a fan of real chicken fried steak for breakfast, this is no longer the place. They have replaced the real cube steak with a pre formed meat product patty.

I&apos;d also like to note that their formerly great hash browns are not anymore. They used to come with well grilled crust and obviously parboiled potatoes. Now the potatoes inside are raw. 

I don&apos;t know if they&apos;ve had a change in kitchen management to cause these quality issues, but the least they could do is change their menus to remove the real cube steak boast, which is clearly deceptive.","FRENCH TOAST STICKS. nuff said! 
Great no frills diner, excellent safely precautions, and friendly service. Huevos rancheros were delicious, coffee was great! Very cool astronaut decor. Will return!","With all the hype, I really expected better food.  It was Fathers Day and  this was my brother&apos;s choice!   He is a pretty terrific dad and spectacular grandad, so this day he gets what he wants. 

To start out being positive, the staff is delightful and they do a great job of being friendly while keeping the space clean and inviting all day long (and night too, I hear).  

The character of this place is unique. The decor has something for everyone. (lol) Classic diner furnishings complete with booths and a counter at which you can dine.  The menus are those massive plastic menus that seem to always have something stuck to them but ours were sparkling clean.  

Looking across the dining area the  first thing I noticed was a wall FULL of portraits of our astronauts. ( I would have liked a closer look at these but I feared the booth diners might think I was being intrusive ;)   A clockwise glance took me into space with a full wall mural featuring a galaxy.  A glance upwards is a  tray ceiling that definitely has an Asian theme.   Some might say the decor lacks continuity, but I prefer to think of it as a time capsule, offering a shout-out to the establishment&apos;s history. ;)

Fish n chips, if it is on the menu, I am going to order it. Besides, I am in Seattle, right? They should have good fish here , was my thought.    The first bite was perfect. Crispy on the outside. On the inside there was a beautiful chunk of cod done to perfection.  I was tickled.  The fries were gorgeous.   Perfect  cut and perfect doneness for me.  The potatoes are cut with skins on and the fries were delivered while pleasantly crisp. 

Then not so good!   
As the fresh hot food cooled, both the fish and the fries turned totally soggy right before my eyes. ick!!!  I am not sure why this happened, I am supposing  the wrong frying oil?  not fresh frying oil? but whatever the reason, it was a buzz kill. 

What remained outstanding was the coleslaw.  Excellent coleslaw!  I am pretty fussy about my coleslaw so this is a big endorsement.  
Alas, parking costs more than the coleslaw, so I would not recommend you make the trip for just coleslaw. :) 

Sorry guys!",Eggs benedict!! Yes! Also the Huevos Rancheros are huge! Big coffees and larger portions. Nuf said! Try this hip eatery and you won&apos;t regret it.,"So close to being good...but not there.

Went on a Saturday morning and bypassed the people waiting for tables to sit at the bar. The food took a really long time (but came out in order from when other people ordered). The shrimp and grits were good, but the grits had sat just a little too long where they formed into a polenta blob. Still really tasty but not quite the right texture. They were, however, really tasty and paired well with the shrimp/sausage. The blueberry Pancake was fine, nothing special. The breakfast burrito was promising, but it was so incredibly oily. The tortilla was literally shining and was gross to pick up. 

We would come back, because it seemed like it was more of an execution issue, instead of flavor.","There is something special about North Star Diner &amp; Shanghai Room.  Perhaps it&apos;s the 24/7 eatery, serving classic breakfast entrees or the dim-lit bar with cocktails and boozy milkshakes.  But I&apos;m a fan.  

I met my friends here for dinner as they love North Star Diner and are lucky enough to live walking distance from this place.  After coming here for a breakfast dinner I can see why they and many others frequent the spot.  I like the casual vibes of its space theme in the diner and the more intimate Shanghai Room next door.  Staff were also super friendly here. 

For dinner I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak plate because you can get this bad boy at all hours of the day, including dinner time!  I don&apos;t often eat breakfast food, but the chicken fried steak was di-vine.  The meat was tenderized, so as to easily cut it, with just a butter knife, and I really enjoyed the country gravy smothered on top, with a bed of hashbrowns underneath the steak.  I also ordered my eggs sunny side up, which made my meal all the more yummy, with its runny yolk, creating its own sauce. 

Come for the breakfast food, stay for the drinks and atmosphere.  Located in Greenwood, North Star Diner &amp; Shanghai Room is truly a treat and one that all Seattleites must check out, especially at night.  Plus, it&apos;s Anthony Bourdain-recommended, so, you&apos;d be a fool not to.","I love the people and the food. Quality diner fare with some creative but not pretentious options. Build your own breakfast burrito yields amazing creations. Great music, interesting decor, stable staff who are real people. We love you Northstar!

Hey, haters: they recently updated their decor including new/more comfortable seats, etc.","Have you ever heard people talk about old Seattle, the way it was before the tech giants took over and raised everyone&apos;s rent a million dollars? They make Seattle sound like a sleepy fishing village, going at an easy pace, with no cares, where everyone has a caffeine addiction and a perpetual hangover, and everyone is playing rock and roll. That&apos;s pretty much this year place in a nut shell. 
If you go to their website and read their story, you&apos;ll learn that this humble hipster eatery was once a local land mark Chinese spot, loved by the locals, but it was lost during The Boom, along with a number of faceless names. Most of which are now apartment buildings. So they decided to keep some of that old Seattle here. Changing very little other than the menu, this breakfast diner moved right in serving right on the original plates. This place has a quirky ness for sure and the employees look like the  members of an indie band. When our server came to the table it took me a few seconds to realize they were here to take my order and not some random guy questioning my musical tastes. The decor is mostly still from the old Chinese restaurant but they have given it a weird space vibe which is fitting for the city with the space needle (another randomly space themed thing). 
The staff were all very friendly. The food was fresh and tasty. The environment welcoming and fun.","Amazing options for a place that is open 24 hours! I wasn&apos;t aware there was any place offering decent food at all hours of the day. Thanks to the late Anthony Bourdain for visiting in the Seattle episode and bringing this place to my attention. My friend and I were super hungry after seeing Little Shop of Horrors at Shoreline College and were looking for some comfort food. North Star Diner truly has something for everyone. Our server was really sweet and attentive, making sure to answer all of our questions before taking our orders. 

I ordered a salad with the dressing on the side and it came slathered in dressing - hungry and not wanting to be a complainer I suffered through the meal. When I told the server at the end of the meal he asked why I didn&apos;t say anything right away - I explained not wanting to waste perfectly good lettuce and that it was okay. My only suggestion is that the chef put less dressing on salads as one can always add dressing later but nothing can be done with an overdressed salad. I also pointed out that the salad should have come with avocado and it had none. He apologized and brought out half an avocado in slices so I could enjoy the last bit of the meal with them. 

I&apos;m guessing the cook that evening was not familiar with the menu descriptions as it was also supposed to have tortilla strips but actually had wonton strips (totally different texture/flavor than what I was expecting for this salad). All of this is to say it wasn&apos;t the fault of the server and he was lovely through and through. The kitchen could probably use some closer attention to detail later in the evenings, but I am still looking forward to visiting in the future to try out other menu items!","Mmmk. So. I was a little torn on how to rank this place. So when I give it 3 stars, I really do mean &quot;A OK&quot;. 

The place is neat--they have a whole wall of astronaut portraits! (Though, I never did find Leland Melvin&apos;s dog portrait. Their shirts are rad and I still super want one even though my experience was less-than-stellar.

Service was EXCELLENT. Our server was great. If I was rating on service alone, it would&apos;ve been 5 stars. 

Unfortunately my food was... not rad. To be fair, I probably shouldn&apos;t have ordered a bunless burger at a diner... but it was just... a bummer. The patty was super small and thin. The guac it came with was the consistency of jarred baby food. My fries were quite under-done. 

My friend who I was with got the biscuits and gravy, and it looked GREAT. (Unfortunately I can&apos;t eat it.) my other friend&apos;s sandwich looked GREAT. (But I can&apos;t eat that either.) (Though, he said his coleslaw was bad and didn&apos;t eat it.)

All in all, I&apos;ll certainly give this place another chance someday--but definitely getting breakfast food.","3 AM trip to a diner after bar hopping? this is typical for me, i live in the diner state (jersey). However, after seeing this dine on one of anthony&apos;s bourdain&apos;s show, i kjnew it was worth a trip. At first i was a bit skeptical, its basically a big open room with painted walls and framed photos of the astronauts in the USA. Kinda bare and empty, but you sit down at the booth and get a menu thrown at you. service was okay, wouldnt say it was too fast. however..the food...

i ordered the french toast and all i got were 3 big slices of french bread slices. at first i was a little disappointed, but i completely judged. the french toast was out of this world. fluffy inside, slightly fried outside crust. it was hot too! my friend got the green eggs and ham hash and she was practically licking her plate dry. prices are very generous, portions too. 

ps they serve alcohol but stop at 2 am.","We came to this place to get breakfast and they were PACKED. So instead of having us wait, they said we could head over to the bar section (which is open 24 hours) and eat there if we wanted. It didn&apos;t seem ideal at first, but in the end, couldn&apos;t have had a better experience. The Shanghai room was so unique! On top of that, the breakfast burrito I had was life changing. I highly recommend this place!","Not a clean place to eat....
I&apos;m sure it is an ok place to drink alcohol and not be aware of your surroundings. Food is bland and tasteless- overpriced.
Think insane asylum cafeteria.
Furniture is sticky, mismatched and unlevel.
Don&apos;t get me started on the smells.","North Star Diner- a go to for a late night/after drinks/I&apos;m drunk breakfast food.

One of the most helpful and reliable late night grub-if you want breakfast at 3am in the morning but make in feel home made. 

Give this one a shot, and let me know what you think","Good spot for good diner food. They have a huge menu, literally something for everyone. This includes breakfast, lunch and dinner 24/7. They have a general selection of beers, including some local options. For dinner I opted for the Rueben sandwich. It was good, but honestly could have used a little more meat. The fries it came with were good as well. 

The interior is very eclectic and unique. Service was quick and attentive. Overall, it was a good stop.","We came here last Friday around 6 for a friend&apos;s low key birthday get together. For a place featured on an Anthony Bourdain show, I thought this place would have been PACKED on a Friday evening. We were pleasantly sirprised when we had ample seating and things weren&apos;t too loud.

We easily found seating for around 12 people in the lounge. It is really interesting to have this dark red, sultry lounge just opposite their diner. It&apos;s definitely a cool vibe inside with a 360 bar in the center. Best thing is that happy hour goes till 7 pm and has great deals on cocktails, beer, wine and food. Service was slow (lack of enough bartenders that evening) and they sometimes forgot our orders but they were super gracious about getting it made or fixed right away.

Cocktails are made very well. They look great and taste great. Some are too sweet for me but others were just right. You can taste fresh fruit juices. Happy hour prices are only $6 a cocktail vs $9-$12 normally. They even do tiki style drinks like their version of a singapore sling. I particularly liked their signature drink, the Northstar.

The lazy susan drink ( 8 random shots on a giant lazy susan turn table for around $45) was cool to see but shots were not strong.

The food was pretty good. I got the HH fried buffalo cauliflower and the french toast sticks. Soooo good. Freat flavor and so crisp.

Karaoke was fun after but the DJ could have done the audio better. Need to up the support music to drown out terrible singers like myself lol.

Really fun place with great drinks and food.","Anthony was on the nose with this place! It was wonderful, from the food to the ambiance and staff... I loved it all. Who can say no to 24/hr breakfast and home made soy sauce?? It&apos;s the little touches that go a long way... like a celery cocktail! I went with the spam/pineapple/egg option. It was good. The fried cauliflower was also great.","We decided to go to Seattle for New Years and chose to end our last night(1/4/2021) dinner here and we were not disappointed. We wanted a nice steak dinner. We order the bacon wrapped scallops, lobster, filet mignon, &amp; Wagyu filet mignon(didn&apos;t get a photo, my bf isn&apos;t a fan of me taking photos of his food lol). It was all so tasty and delicious. We were very happy and satisfied with the service all around. From the moment we entered to the minute we left (&amp; we overstayed , but they were really nice). However the waiter (I forgot his name) he was amazing! The recommendations on the menu and even what to do or try in Seattle the next time we went back. He really made our dinner and last night worth it. 
Obviously this is all during covid times, but needless to say we felt comfortable with the patio dining. Clean, social distanced, &amp; masks. If your thinking of giving them a try I would recommend it.","Deciding not to travel for my birthday due to COVID and craving lamb, I was pleased to find Daniel&apos;s Broiler offered it and found it was a perfect chance to try Daniel&apos;s Broiler.

Their Australian grilled lamb comes with 3 huge lamb chops (which are essentially 6 mini chops combined at other places). The only thing heftier than the lamb is the price ($60), but in my opinion it&apos;s worth the price tag with how big the cuts are and how much meat you get. The garlic mashed potatoes that accompany the dish perfectly balances how rich the lamb is. The red pepper jelly was interesting, not overly sweet or spicy. To this day my taste buds are trying to determine if I liked it or leaning towards &apos;meh&apos;.

For the price of the lamb, I do wish there was some sort of veggie side as well included. To make up for this, I went with the crispy brussels sprouts (okay, confession, they had me at bacon). While tasty, for $14 I wish they gave you some more. The amount received would have made sense for a Happy Hour price. Because of this, I&apos;m deducting one star.

Overall, I&apos;m pleased with Daniel&apos;s Broiler and will definitely return for their lamb and for some of the other items on their menu. They do offer takeout and are available on some of the delivery apps.","We had something HUGE to celebrate, so Daniel&apos;s Broiler it was!

Upon walk in, my sister and I were kindly greeted by the check-in ladies. We got seated, in the dining area. Our server was incredibly fun and AMAZING! Jordan is one of the best servers I&apos;ve ever had.

His recommendation for the bacon wrapped scallops was on point. Not greasy from the bacon, but just the perfect amount to give the scallops that crunch. They were on top of a toasted crostini. I&apos;ll be back for this appetizer. 
We also ordered the filet mignon teriyaki strips. The perfect appetizer combo. The sesame teriyaki sauce is what makes you wanna sing. That good!
Jordan&apos;s attentiveness still gets me. He is a very genuine person, who noticed all the details. Gosh, if you get him, leave him a tip on top of the 20% auto-gratuity charge.

Our main entree was the halibut dish. Oh my god, the halibut just fell apart. My sister really wanted to try this corn pur√©e, and Daniel&apos;s Broiler was kind enough to bring it on the side. We devoured our dishes gracefully. Truly a night to remember. 

I loved celebrating a big life accomplishment right before it all shut down AGAIN. Luckily, they offer curbside pick up and to-go orders during these unpredictable times. I was lucky enough to have the full experience indoors and plan to come back once they reopen. 

On a side note, their deep dish cookie topped with ice cream looked REALLY tasty! We were too full, but next time, we will give it a try.","Austin was our server and he was terrific!! It was our first time at Daniel&apos;s and it was also our 10th wedding anniversary.  What a delightful evening!! 
We decided on the filet mignon and Austin suggested that we add &quot;the Oscar&quot;... that&apos;s Dungeoness crab with hollandaise sauce on top of your steak..... to describe the meal as delicious is a complete understatement....It was exquisite... it was undeniably delicious and over all...... an incredible experience.  
They also placed us at a table by the windows overlooking the marina...awww, it was romantic as the sun set and kissed Seattle goodnight. Highly recommend","My family and I came here to celebrate my birthday with some Covid-friendly outdoor dining.  It was a mix of sunshine and stormy weather, which was fun to enjoy on the patio.  The patio at this location is covered and Daniel&apos;s Broiler also installed a clear, plastic tent liner to keep the rain out.  With the heaters on full blast, it was quite comfortable.  

I was also pleasantly surprised to find the parking lot nearly empty at 4pm on a Sunday.  We were able to park in any of their reserved valet spots for no extra charge.  A real score for downtown!  Everyone we encountered was very friendly, and all made sure to wish me &quot;Happy Birthday!&quot; upon finding out why we were there celebrating.

The food bit was mixed.  First off, I ordered sparkling rose but the waiter brought me a still rose.  I asked if that was the sparkling and he said it was, and even tried to gaslight me by saying, &quot;look, there&apos;s a few bubbles!&quot;  I saw on my receipt later that it had a completely different name than the French version I ordered, but I didn&apos;t want to fight him on it.  Innocent mistake, no real reason to send it back.  The wine was good.  But I didn&apos;t love how the waiter handled it.  

For appetizers, we shared the popcorn shrimp and some clam chowder.  Both were fantastic!  I am addicted to their popcorn shrimp.  It was the best thing of the night.  I also appreciated that the waiter brought us individual bowls to share the larger bowl of clam chowder between the three of us.  We  then shared a couple of salads, with multiple dressings on the side.  Everything was correct, and certainly tasty.  

For the main course, my husband and I shared the bone-in rib eye, which is 30oz and $88.  It only comes with mashed potatoes (or a baked potato, if you choose), no vegetable.  That irks me but since it was a celebration, we added on the asparagus.  The asparagus came with hollandaise but truly, it just tasted like thick butter... good but nothing special.  The asparagus were large and perfectly seasoned, and better tasting on their own.  My MIL got the bacon wrapped scallop appetizer as her entree.  The scallops were perfectly cooked, seared nicely but still juicy and sweet.  They were covered in a tasty beurre blanc, but the bacon wasn&apos;t terribly crisp.  Not a surprise, it is hard to cook both perfectly, and I&apos;d certainly rather have the scallop done right.  

As for the steak, the waiter did have us cut down the middle to ensure it was cooked correctly.  I did the honors... and even with the sharp knife, it was a bit of a challenge.  (Side note:  I had this very steak at the DB in Bellevue last summer, and boy it was like butter... I was really hoping this one would be as good but ugh, it wasn&apos;t.  At all.)  So yes, we cut into it and the very center was nearly rare, but the outside had a grey band, and the cap was hammered.  Like, not a speck of pink.  Frankly, this doesn&apos;t seem like proper steak cooking, especially from a steak restaurant.  It should be seared or charred nicely on the outside, and evenly medium rare down the middle, which is how I ordered it.  Once we started eating, the flavor was fine but the texture was SO tough!  I was disappointed.  My DH and I have been eating healthier lately, so he didn&apos;t seem to care at all, he was so happy to have a steak and some buttery mashed potatoes (the potatoes are really good....)  I, on the other hand, only ate a little bit because it just wasn&apos;t worth the calories.  I&apos;m sure you&apos;re thinking, &quot;so did you send it back?&quot;  No, I didn&apos;t.  Like I said, my DH had no problem eating it.  He did admit it was tough, though.  I just hate sending things back, especially during Covid when restaurants are suffering.  I don&apos;t know if this was a one-off or not, but I will return to Daniel&apos;s Broiler.  Probably another location that is more convenient, and where I&apos;ve had better luck!","Eager to go out for a date night we made a reservation for the patio seating here for a nice SLU sunset view. Unfortunately the evening we decided to do this was the same evening a gaggle of older ladies from NJ also happened to be here and it highlighted just how bad the accoustics are in the outside dining area of this DB location. The three of them created such cacophony that we could not hear each other across the table. 

Aside from how loud it was it was also very cold on the patio so if you choose to dine outside, bring a blanket and wear warm clothes!  Our server himself was a little hard of hearing so coupled with the loud table behind us we had to yell back and forth just to hear each other in close proximity - it was jarring and unpleasant to say the least! We complained that the table nearby was really loud and he lamented he felt the same but did not offer to move us to another table or inside. I figured they were all full up inside and there were no other options.

On top of the grating environment the service was a bit slow for how empty the restaurant appeared to be. The loud ladies behind us had a female server who was super attentive and their meal moved along quicker than ours. The food here was very good so that should not be overlooked. I love the bbq shrimp and the food was everything we had hoped for. As we were leaving I was surprised how empty it was inside. Had I known there was seating available inside I would much rather have enjoyed our meal inside where it was quiet and warm. For the luxury cost you pay plus the required 20% service/gratuity this experience didn&apos;t quite meet my expectations. Our bill was $140+ and it just wasn&apos;t a pleasant meal - it certainly didn&apos;t feel like it was worth it.","Once again lockdown restrictions are announced. We wanted to go out in style the way we did the night of the first lockdown.  Hmmm Daniels is our comforting place of refuge. The food the service..everything was perfection.  Highly recommend the filet mignon.
always cooked to perfection. We will be ordering to go to support this awesome favorite of ours and cant wait to head back in after lockdown.","I&apos;ve always loved Daniel&apos;s. Pretty fair pricing, great views, and very friendly service. I always enjoy my experience here. Will continue returning!","This was my 1st time coming here. For appetizers we ordered the bacon wrapped scallops and filet mignon bites. Anything with bacon is good but with scallops is even better.  The filet mignon bites were alright.  I like teriyaki sauce but not drenched with filet mignon.  For my main course I had ordered the Australian lamb chops with garlic mashed potatoes.  It was phenomenal. The flavor and the way it was grilled. The garlic mashed potatoes are a must if you love garlic with lots of butter! The lamb chops were definitely a good choice on my part, very palatable. My friend got the rib eye steak boned which was another great choice and my other two friends ordered a lobster tail dish and filet mignon steak.  I thought everything was well presented and tasted very delectable.  Our waitress was very helpful and attentive.  I would definitely come back and next time I will probably try the A5 wagyu!","Technically would give 3 1/2 stars . Place is cute and great view . Food isn&apos;t like great and mind blowing but it&apos;s good . Service was nice . The down fall is the prices some of it is reasonable , but feel like some of the items is over priced .","***Takeout Order Review Only***

I ordered the Popcorn Shrimp: 3/5- a bit too much batter but I appreciated the 2 sauces that were included and overall it was still tasty, and the Clam Chowder: 4/5- I&apos;m not a Clam Chowder expert but this had a decent amount of clams compared to other restaurants and wasn&apos;t overly salty as my 2 appetizers.

For my entree, I ordered the Steak Sandwich: 5/5- it seems like the sandwiches and burgers are only available on the Takeout Menu but this was definitely the best part of my meal and I would reorder this. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly, seasoned nicely (didn&apos;t need to put any sauce on this), and my favorite part was that it came on a delicious sourdough baguette. It also came with fries and I had a decent amount of leftover :) 

I am a bit hesitant on coming here for dinner and ordering a steak (most of the negative reviews seem to be based on this experience and spending a lot of $$$ but I definitely recommend getting take out).","DANIEL&apos;s LESHI -is nothing less than Top Shelf.  I ordered our Thanksgiving Dinner for pick up thinking I ordered from the South Lake Union Location.  My husband arrived and they had no record of our Order.  We showed them the Proof of Purchase.  I called the Leshi Location and Kay, the GM, answered and confirmed I did place my Order at that Location.  She  was so kind and made sure we received our Dinner at the South Lake Union Location.

DANIEL&apos;s South Lake Union - Exceptional!  They were so Kind in taking care of us to ensure we got our Dinner.

Thank you to DANIEL&apos;s for saving our Thanksgiving!

Stay Fabulous!","Received a $50 giftcard from a friend last Christmas so we decided to use it tonight before a show at McCaw Hall.

Food:  3.5 stars. We liked the crab cake ($20) and the tenderloin beef sliders ($14-$4 off HH)

Value:  2 stars. HH price ranged from $14-$24. There were 6 items which qualified for the HH $4 off. 

Service:  5 stars. Prompt and attentive. 

Ambiance:  3.5 stars. Too dark to see any views but it was lively for a Monday night. 

Parking:  1 Star. $8 for valet; $7 self park on the gravel lot next to valet 40 yards from the front door.

Service charge:  0 star.  20% was added to the bill which the restaurant kept for employee wages and benefits. Huh?  And we also paid tax on this amount?!  Double ouch!  So...is this in lieu of tips?  If so, why was there a tip line?  Our waitress alerted us to this so we don&apos;t double tip. Super confusing!  Let&apos;s just hope this practice works out better for the employees. We didn&apos;t like it at all. 

Meh...there are way too many other options out there. We won&apos;t be returning.","Wasn&apos;t real hungry but wanted a little bit of steak, got the kids steak bites to go. I didn&apos;t expect much from a kids meal but MY GOSH. INSANE good. I&apos;m not typically much of a steak person, but wow. The mashed potatoes were also great!","Really enjoy this location of Daniel&apos;s as the view and the setting is spectacular, especially from the bar. It&apos;s the only high-end restaurant on the lake in Seattle. Daniel&apos;s prices are kind of nuts but the food quality is always there. 
I was a regular for years (until Covid) and still come in now and then. Management gets a little chilly if you only come to the bar and not the restaurant, which was always surprising to me. Business is business, right? They still take my money either way. Some of the servers are extremely friendly, one or two have a chip on their shoulder. However, the good definitely outweighs the bad here. Yet for the prices Daniel&apos;s uniformly charges at all its locations, I would go to Bellevue for a steak dinner as it&apos;s a much more luxe experience. I am always surprised that the exterior of the restaurant is a little funky... office junk and garbage sitting around by the entrance for days and weeks. Does the manager not see it on the way in? Beyond that, it doesn&apos;t seem like a dollar has been spent on the decor since they opened, but in a way, maybe that&apos;s part of the charm. 
Biggest problem though... the alcoholic beverages are so SO small. The size of the martini is laughable, really. They are very tight on the alcohol portions and they are miserly compared to similar upscale steak restaurants. They don&apos;t do a lot of business here anymore, but it used to be one of the top places in town. I&apos;m glad they&apos;ve stuck around for almost four decades. It is a unique circa 1980 restaurant with excellent quality food prepared well each and every time. It&apos;s decidedly not hip these days... which is a good thing, because then it would probably be too busy for me.","Had a very lack luster experience at Daniels last night. We visited the Lake Union location for my birthday, the first time we&apos;ve been out since the closures. We ordered the crab legs to start, which were delicious. The drinks took awhile though, and came out after we were done with the appetizer. It was a bottle of champagne and 1 drink, so it shouldn&apos;t have taken that long. We ordered 2 lamb dishes, the ahi tuna and the Daniels 12 oz Filet. The meals took another hour to arrive. It was pretty dark in the restaurant so it was hard to check the doneness. We were hungry though so we dived in. My steak wasn&apos;t chewable at first but assumed it was a one-off. After eating for a few minutes, we pulled a camera light out and realized that not only my steak, but the other 2 lamb dishes were raw. Not rare, but completely raw. When we were able to get the servers attention, I didn&apos;t even have to say anything, she looked at the steak and gasped. They took it back to recook what was left, and offered 1 scoop of sorbet as consolation. I have never sent back food before and I&apos;m not one to write negative food reviews, but this was a bit unsettling. Their menu is 90% red meat, cooking them raw shouldn&apos;t be an accident. We chose Daniel&apos;s because we knew we would get good, quality food, and having spent nearly 500 combined between 4 people, it&apos;s disappointing we didn&apos;t get the experience we were expecting.","The restaurant is located in South Lake Union, and it has a great view. You might see seaplanes taking off and landing.

I tried Filet Mignon. It was a good flavor and size.

The inside wasn&apos;t so noisy and had a nice atmosphere. So I think you can use this restaurant for a dinner with important guests.","take out is always a let down than eating at the resturant,  because you never know how it is until you get home, than it&apos;s too late to do anything about it. But it&apos;s hard to make steak and mashed potatoes  look bad,  still hot 20 minutes later after getting it home.It was very tasty, it was ashamed it was my first time there and it had to be takeout, I&apos;ll bet the I door dining is great. So if you  really want to treat yourself to a steak made your way and willing to spend some extra dollars, give it a try and let me know, your experience","My family and I went there when they opened since covid. I made a reservation for inside at 6:30. We arrived early at 6 pm hoping to be seated early. It wasn&apos;t so we walked around outside. We asked if we could drink in the bar and they said no the bar is closed and no drinks allowed out of the bar even though there were 2 gentlemen drinking in the waiting area. 
We came back and there were different people at the check in desk so naturally I check in again the older lady grey short hair says yes we have you checked in. It will be a while. Ok I walk away and notice the 2 older gentlemen still waiting - it&apos;s been a half hour since we arrived early (6:00). They inform us that they&apos;ve waiting for their 6 pm reservations and have not yet seated either. 
I ask the lady how about long? She replies she&apos;s not sure. And that she can&apos;t ask them to leave. She was defensive about this and of course I don&apos;t want that but you mean to tell me you can&apos;t gauge on whether they are still on their entrees or dessert? She said we can eat outside without a wait. It is now 6:45. So we opted to eat outside. It was chilly outside even with coats on and the heater was not on
Service was SLOW, our waiter seemed new with the new order system. Which is fine we ordered appetizers and drinks. Our drinks came out after the appetizers. Our dinner arrives about an hour since we sat down and both Filet mignons were medium not medium rare and the garlic mash had no garlic flavor. Oh and the older lady went to each table to check on their meals except us!!! 
We usually enjoy this location and expected to have a delicious meal with exceptional service but we left with a sour taste and will not be going to that location. Not only did it start off bad from the beginning but it lasted till the end of our meal. I don&apos;t feel the 20% gratuity is warranted for this type of service. I know it&apos;s after covid but let us know instead of ignoring us. It&apos;s appalling to me how this high end steakhouse gave this horrible experience. Our bill of $450 was not worth it.","UPDATE: Lowered to 1 star after yelp commenter (affiliated with business?) suggested I reach out to restaurant via FB message. I did, and included my receipt, was told management would reach out but I never heard from anyone. Smdh","Great food, awesome customer service and they are taking all precautions to prevent the spread of  covid!

We had the Corned Beef Hash &amp; Eggs and Country Benedict with hot and cold brew coffee. The corned beef was cooked to perfection. Nicely crisp over a bed of hash browns. The raspberry jam served paired deliciously with the corned beef. Treat yourself and make a little Sammy. 

The Country Benedict took biscuits and gravy to another level! That was one of the best biscuits I EVER had! Fluffy, not dry and flavorful. I topped off my bite with the raspberry jam...best decision ever!! 

The staff takes preventing the spread of covid seriously! Social distancing, wiping down seats and tables, wearing masks and gloves and using Q-Code menus. We definitely felt safe at Beth&apos;s Cafe!

Yall come pay this gem a visit!!","This spot is still open during late night hours! Their customer service is always at its best. Our meals are always made fresh and our wait time is never more than 10 minutes! The bacon scramble was delicious. Our meals tend to be HUGE and thats what gets me hooked!! Try their fries, they&apos;re delicious! As for cleanliness, its clean. They have sanitizer for everyone at the front door. Theres a fee charge as well. I believe 5$ to dine in. Besides that, every visit to Beths Cafe is wonderful. Sad to see all the beautiful,creative drawings be taken off the walls. Till next time!","I love going to Beth&apos;s! I haven&apos;t been in a few months, but it is always really good basic breakfast food and huge portions. They serve breakfast all the time, and are open all night (at least on the weekends). Definitely a good spot if you want some diner breakfast food. Parking can be a pain, but it&apos;s worth it.","Have been here in last summer. It seems to be nothing special, but very tasty, home-style.
  A huge omelet of 12 eggs with mushrooms, cheese, ham - bomb ($ 20) 
  Caesar salad - mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, croutons, sauce - 
  Tomato soup, basil, probably something else - yummy 
  Great place, great tasty food, highly recommended!","beth&apos;s has been featured on food network because of their gigantic portion sizes with omlettes, i think they do 12 egg omlettes, &amp; they&apos;ve had different challenges associated with the omlettes. i would recommend coming here if you have a huge appetite or haven&apos;t eaten anything, you are guaranteed to leave here full. they are still 24hrs &amp; have COVID modifications. (online menu&apos;s social distancing etc) i came here with a friend around 4am &amp; we ordered breakfast. delicious, hash browns were my favorite, perfectly crisp with a hint of butter. bacon was also decent &amp; the eggs were perfect. 

cinnamon roll 10/10 recommend bc the frosting comes on the side which is nice because sometimes it can be too sweet. 

keep them in business, they are struggling with clientele right now***** don&apos;t let them go out of business.","Famous for it&apos;s giant omelette, Beth&apos;s is a hole in the wall 24 hour sanctuary for all things diner. Bring a friend and an appetite and you will not leave unsatisfied.

Immediately walking inside, you will notice the walls filled with drawings from all the guests who walk in. A quirky touch that will leave your experience at Beth&apos;s different every time you come. If you&apos;re coming in for the giant omelette, the open kitchen allows you to watch just how the behemoth is made. The friendly staff let us sit at a table with a great view of the kitchen. 

The omelettes come in two sizes: 6 eggs and 12 eggs. Prices of the omelette for each size vary upon ingredients. The first omelette that caught our interest was the Southwestern Exposure and the first one on the menu. Featured on Man v. Food, this omelette features 3 bean chili with red and green peppers, onions, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream, and cheddar cheese. 

Maybe we were just very hungry, very excited, or a little bit of both but we cleaned the entire plate in about 8 minutes. A review of the omelette isn&apos;t necessary, given how quickly we finished it.

Leaving the diner, I noticed giant cinnamon rolls and slices of cake in their fridge. Already full, I bookmarked this place so I could remember to come back just for dessert.","In one word, what food item makes Seattle famous?  You guessed it... salmon.  Salmon is caught locally, unloaded fresh at local docks, and is delicious prepared any way you can think of.  Don&apos;t get me wrong, as I absolutely adore salmon, but to me, when I think of Seattle cuisine, Beth&apos;s Cafe comes immediately to my mind, as it&apos;s home to the 12-egg omelet, and the most famous, greasy spoon diner cuisine the Pacific Northwest has to offer.

Actually, this visit happened a couple of years ago, and I&apos;m only now getting up the time to post my visit on Yelp.  Sorry for the delay.

 I was dazzled and amazed on this Friday morning, August 18, 2017, that the few on-street parking spaces in front of Beth&apos;s Caf√© weren&apos;t jammed full of parked cars, and there wasn&apos;t a line of hungry diners waiting on the sidewalk for their turn at a table.  (I have read many Yelp reviews about this restaurant.)  At first I thought the restaurant was closed - how could that be for a restaurant that has been open 24/7/365 for over 60 years? - until I saw the neon-lit &quot;open&quot; sign in the window that reassured me, and beckoned me inside.  Parking is limited and tight on Aurora Blvd. and the surrounding neighborhood, but I managed to park in an alley, a short block what you say. At 0730 on this Friday morning, the neighborhood was just fine, but after dark, from what I saw and what I&apos;ve read, the neighborhood is &quot;sketchy&quot; at best.

As I walked in the front door, the first thing I noticed was the open kitchen - which is something that I truly adore - and the &quot;Please Wait to be Seated&quot; sign.  One of the two servers on duty, Janelle, as seated at the small counter, working on a crossword puzzle - I assume she was an all-night hostess, as she looked tired - looked up at me, and said that I could seat myself anywhere I wanted to site.  That was an easy choice for me, as I sat on a stool at the counter, so I could take in all of the action, and watch the chef at work.  

The main dining room is to your left, which you might miss, as you  stare at the pots of coffee and the seven flats of eggs &quot;on deck,&quot; and ready to go.

I took a seat at the counter, near where Janelle was working on her crossword puzzle.  Beth&apos;s Caf√© has been in the same location since 1954, and I think the only &quot;modernization&quot; that has been made is the computerized cash register, at the left of the photo.  All orders are still taken on a note pad, and placed on an order wheel.  The two gentlemen at the right of the counter were enjoying omelettes - the 6-egg variety - and taking photos, so naturally they were interested in what I was doing.

As we were discussing the omelette choices on the menu, I mentioned that I was going with a 6-egg &quot;Southwestern Exposure&quot; omelette, and one of the guys remarked &quot;That&apos;ll kill you.&quot;  I came back with &quot;If I was really hungry, I&apos;d go with the 12-egg version,&quot; and that drew a laugh out of everybody, including all three staff members who were working this morning.

Beth&apos;s omelettes come in two sizes:  6 or 12 eggs.  This is the omelette portion of the menu, but the menu includes all of your favorite breakfast, lunch and diner cuisine.  Since Beth&apos;s is open 24/7, anything on the menu is available at any time, but while chatting with my friendly server, Liz, she told me that about 75% of the restaurant&apos;s business comes from the breakfast menu.

I really wanted to go with a 12-egg omelette, but I just couldn&apos;t... If Adam Richman, of Man v. Food fame couldn&apos;t finish a 12-egg omelette, I wouldn&apos;t stand the chance of a snowball in Hades attempting the omelette challenge... So, I &quot;wimped-out&quot; and went with a 6-egg &quot;Southwestern Exposure&quot; omelette.

I really, really wanted to order a 12-egg omelette, if nothing else, for bragging rights, just to &quot;give it a go.&quot; But, maybe I&apos;m getting too old, or too sensible for those kind of antics.  I figured if Adam Richman, the man with the voracious appetite, couldn&apos;t finish the omelette, than I didn&apos;t have a prayer.  So, I went for the smaller, 6-egg version, which is still a massive, 2-1/2 pound breakfast behemoth.

I ordered the &quot;Southwestern Exposure&quot; omelette, which includes Cheddar cheese, salsa, sour cream and brisket chili.  It&apos;s served on a large platter, and sits on top of a large helping of all-you-can-eat hash brown potatoes - as if you could eat anything else, lol - with a couple of thick slices of toast on the side.

My omelette was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  Every bite tasted a little different, I suppose due to the distribution of the cheese, salsa, sour cream chili.  The hash browns were some of the best I have ever enjoyed, and the toast was good too.  I really wish I could have ordered a second helping of hash browns, but by the time I finished this monster breakfast, I was stuffed.  If you&apos;re really hungry, and you enjoy a superior breakfast, this is your restaurant. 

Beth&apos;s Caf√© is a Seattle iconic restaurant, a legend, and is a magnet to all &quot;foodies,&quot; as it attracts lovers of over-","The only thing that&apos;s a bonus is it&apos;s always open. The staff is far from friendly. Of the line is short give it a try, but if it&apos;s long drive on by.","Beth&apos;s is Seattle&apos;s premier 24-hour diner dive. It&apos;s got it all: huge portions, big tables for groups, milkshakes, a thousand eggs a day, even a jukebox. Bring your friend on their last night in the city - just when they can&apos;t fit another bite - because their look of surrender when the 12-egg omelette arrives will be blow up the Gram. 

The first thing you&apos;ll notice is the drawings. Walls are caked in contributions, customers expressing their love and loyalty through Pokemon or Rick burps. Ask for crayons and try to win the honor before your time runs out and plates cover the table :) 

Portions sizes range from reasonable (their small meals) to outrageous. The poster child is the famous and aforementioned omelet, which comes in two sizes, six eggs and twelve, each with toast and bottomless hash browns. Come for one meal and leave with three! Other favorites include the country fried steak and the waffle breakfast. For sweets, skip the cheesecake and chocolate cake and go straight for the milkshakes and the cinnamon role, ask for it a la mode. 

Other tips:
1) Beth&apos;s actually has a small parking lot behind the restaurant, enter through the alley. 
2) They don&apos;t take reservations and your whole party must be present for seating. 
3) Starve yourself beforehand. 
4) Too many toast options, which will I choose? --egg toast 10/10","I ordered biscuits and gravy, something I&apos;m a huge fan of and feel I have a pretty low bar / standard for. I just love biscuits. I feel you can&apos;t really go wrong, like I&apos;ll get this at continental hotel breakfasts and be super pleased. However I felt at 10+ dollars it should&apos;ve been much better and it wasn&apos;t worth that in taste or value at all. 
Also this entire cafe is very .. ok idk if it&apos;s actually dirty but it FELT so dirty/damp, like they never turn on the heat enough. I don&apos;t understand the hype.","A friend and I ate here on Thursday this place is grungy but man The omelette was huge and delicious! Tons of hash browns cooked perfectly.  Coffee was great, with excellent service!","If I owned this place, I would do a complete gut and redo. The amount of filth in this restaurant is shocking and I cannot believe it has not  been shut down.

The vents in the ceiling look like they must be breaking some kind of code. The black staining the ceiling is alarming and there is black gunk and mold literally falling off the vent.

The bathroom looks like something out of a horror movie.

I really feel like I if they think the drawings covering the walls are what this brand needs to hold on to in order to keep this place going, it&apos;s definitely time to close shop. The drawings prevent the ability to clean the walls. They are not even placed nicely on the walls. 

When we sat down the people behind us pointed out there was hair in his coffee.  He then went on about how he&apos;s had to eat in third world countries and he can handle it. Doesn&apos;t sound like a statement that really makes this place look good. &quot;Beths cafe: Comparable to third world countries.&quot;

There are also scrapings of peoples plates by the &quot;waiting room&quot; which looks more like a torture room from the movie Saw. Want to play a game? See how long you can stay in John Wayne Gacy&apos;s murder room. The walls are covered with  half torn up kid drawings.

How&apos;s the food? I  used to come here ages ago when I was a kid with my father. Whatever nostalgia I had has been destroyed. There is only one item I get thanks to being trained by my dad as a kid. The Full House. There is something about the taste that I can&apos;t get anywhere else. Like McDonald&apos;s always has its own taste, or Burger King has its own. Will I ever come back for that taste? Not after waking up to the current state of Beths Cafe. Drop the 1990&apos;s thing, it&apos;s like an old guy trying to dress like he  did in high school, which is also what the employee&apos;s are actually doing. It just doesnt work and its sad.","The servings are monstrous. The omelettes are known for their sizes, 6 eggs or 12 eggs. The omelette plates also come with unlimited hash browns. The food is greasy, plentiful, and delicious; the perfect cure for a weekend hangover. The cafe itself has cool hand drawn pictures from patrons all over the walls. However, it&apos;s a bit dirty. I guess that&apos;s expected as I believe it is opened 24 hours. It was crowded on the Sunday morning I went but I can&apos;t help to think it gets a bit ratchet there showing up on a Saturday night at 2am. 

Key takeaways: large and good food but a bit dirty.","I came here at 6:30am with five hungry college guys after pulling an all-nighter. I had never heard of Beth&apos;s, but the guys suggested it since it&apos;s open 24/7. 

Beth&apos;s cafe is a hella DIVE. The outside is indiscreet and easily overlooked if you don&apos;t know where you&apos;re going. Thankfully, my friends had been before and knew exactly where to go. 

When you first walk in, you see drawings from customers plastered all over the wall. Red booths line the walls on both sides of the restaurant adding to the diner vibe.

A guy with a long gray beard immediately seated us at our table and a woman came out to serve as water and take our orders.

Beths has been apparently featured on the show Mans Versus Food for their 12-egg omelet combo. I obviously was not in a caveman eating mood, so I ordered scrambled eggs and ham with wheat toast instead ($13.50). My meal came with unlimited hashbrowns which is something I&apos;ve never seen other restaurants do before.

The food portions are HUGE. My ham steak was thick and as big as my face. The toast was also thick and was buttered to perfection. The eggs were tasty and moist as well. The hashbrowns weren&apos;t crispy, but were plentiful and buttery. I was able to finish everything except for the ham, which in hindsight, I wish I had gotten sausage links or chicken fried steak like the guys instead. None of us got seconds of the unlimited hashbrowns because we were all stuffed. My meal ended up costing about $17, because they included an automatic gratuity with groups 6+.

Not gonna lie, I was a little sketched out by the host because he was carrying around some trashy looking keys (I think it had worn stuffed animals and other weird and eclectic stuff attached to it), but he was a nice guy overall. The silverware also had been sitting out and didn&apos;t look super clean, but they have a Good Health rating posted on their door.

TLDR; if you&apos;re looking for an elegant or first-date restaurant this isn&apos;t it. But if you&apos;re looking for a late night recovery meal, you&apos;re in the right spot.

Overall, 4/5 for food, 4/5 for service, 2/5 for atmosphere","I heard about their colossal omelets from my boyfriend, and decided one late night to go try it out with our other friend. Of course we ordered the 12 egg Southern Exposure which was fabulously more than enough food for 3 people, but mistakes were made and I ordered the country fried steak entree in addition to our dozen egg omelet. Needless to say we left with leftovers. 

The quality of the food was quite average. The gravy on the country fried steak was pretty disappointing. It was really dense and not very flavorful. The experience of consuming the largest omelet I&apos;ve ever seen was definitely amusing and was probably the most alluring part of the diner. 

The construction of the omelet was a bed of hash browns, slathered in chili, and blanketed in egg. It was actually pretty good until your stomach capacity starts failing you but I have absolutely no regrets haha. Overall, not the best diner, but for anyone looking for some greasy late night comfort food, Beth&apos;s is a satisfying choice.","It pains me to write this review, mainly because I know that this restaurant is a staple in the Seattle area, and the food here is tasty. However, as someone who&apos;s worked in the customer service and hospitality field for years, and also as someone who values the importance of kindness and friendliness... Beth&apos;s Cafe certainly lacks these attributes and that, for me, reduced my desire to ever come back. 

A group of friends and I visited Beth&apos;s last night for a Sunday pick-me-up before the start of our week. We came in excited, ready to eat tasty breakfast foods, and just in an overall cheerful mood. Our moods were definitely not aligned with our hostess, who tossed our menus on the table without looking at us. It wasn&apos;t aligned with our server&apos;s mood either, who didn&apos;t break a smile once, even when we tried breaking the uncomfortable ice. 

While our food was good in taste, and portions were very generous, our overall dining experience was lackluster of friendly customer service and really, the only friendly person we encountered was the woman refilling waters, so kudos &amp; thank you for your kindness!

Oh, this is the first time this has ever happened to me, but I was literally shoved to the side by a server passing by with a hostile &quot;excuse me.&quot;

What caused me to write this review was the feeling of being ripped off when it came to paying for our check and tipping. We were not informed of automatic gratuity until the very last person paid - meaning everyone paid double gratuity due to lack of notification about this practice. 

I certainly respect and understand automatic gratuities for parties of 6 or more, but I cannot wrap my head around &quot;forgetting&quot; to mention this practice, especially when we experienced such negative customer service and bad vibes from the staff overall. 

I also understand that the mood is divey here, and the &quot;harsh&quot; treatment from the servers is part of its &quot;charm,&quot; but I wasn&apos;t impressed, and likely won&apos;t be back nor will I recommend Beth&apos;s Cafe.","On my first ever visit to Seattle for Emerald City Comic Con 2019 and to hang out with on of my best friends from college, he raved that we MUST grab an omelette from this small diner, and boy, he was right!

Him and I came on a Saturday morning around 10:00am and saw there was a small line outside the door of people waiting to get a table.  Now, I will say that the parking is very minimal and tight here.  We ended up parking in the tight parking lot at the rear of the restaurant, so we were lucky.  He put our names on the list and there was about a 20-30 minute wait, which we were fine with.  I thought it was cool how there is writing and hand-drawn art on all of the walls and ceilings here, definitely put off a hipster-ish, Seattle vibe to me.  The staff here were pretty friendly too.

So when I looked at the menu, immediately I knew I had to try one of their omelettes, as the smallest, is six eggs (I&apos;ve never seen or eaten an omelette that big)!!  If you&apos;re feeling extra daring, you could order a twelve egg omelette (and be in an egg-induced food coma the rest of the day).  As for me, I enjoyed a couple cups of coffee and ordered their six egg &quot;The Veggie&quot; omelette and added bacon (because you can&apos;t have enough protein!).

It didn&apos;t take very long for my buddy and I&apos;s omelettes to come out.  For being such a big omelette though, it tasted incredible!  I put some hot sauce on top and went to town.  I loved the fact too that it with each bite, I got egg, veggies, bacon, and hash browns as it was placed on a bed of them.  I ate the whole thing and swept up all of the leftovers that fell out with the slices of whole wheat toast.

I had a great first experience at Beth&apos;s Cafe though and find myself dreaming of getting another six egg omelette every morning now!","Giving it a 4 stars because I have never enjoyed an experience so much where I&apos;ve regretted every moment of it. As I was eating, I had several questions. Why am I here? What decisions led me to this place? What would my younger self think if he saw me eating this? That being said, still an enjoyable experience.

We went to Beth&apos;s at 2 in the morning to get the True Beth&apos;s Experience‚Ñ¢. The drawings inside were super cute, there was one room that was literally only Pokemon which was really cool! It&apos;s endearing to see so many people express themselves here, and to me it&apos;s a nice form of community.

This place is known for their 12 egg omelette, so of course I was going to get one. But I would be an idiot if I thought I could finish this on my own. So, I split one with a friend. We did the logical thing and chose the one we thought was the one that was best for us, so we obviously chose the Triple Bypass. This omelette has breakfast sausage, bacon, diced ham, and American and Swiss cheese. On top of this was a large serving of hash browns that were also bottomless. This thing was massive. Like, I think it was served on a pizza tray.

I&apos;ll be honest, I think that if you get the omelette and rate this lower than a 4, you&apos;re taking this place too seriously. That being said, yeah, the omelette was good. The eggs were cooked all the way through, and it was super meaty and cheesy. I will say that the American cheese was an overwhelming taste, and it was super heavy. I was struggling to finish the omelette and I needed hot sauce and ketchup to finish my half. And while the omelette tasted good, I felt like garbage with every bite after about 2 minutes. The hash browns were also really crispy and went well with the heavy and soft omelette. That being said, lots of fun! We finished after about 15 minutes and I regretted everything.

It is worth mentioning that we did get an extra plate charge with the omelette because we split, which kind of sucks. The service was also not the best, but do I really care given that it was 2am? Not really.

I&apos;m never coming here again. There is no reason for me to come here again after experiencing the 12 egg omelette. It was a pilgrimage that was memorable and extremely fun but one that I would never do. I went on a run the next morning and felt like trash. Thanks Beth!","This place is outstanding!

The amount of food you get is insane, and the quality of it is even better. It&apos;s a little sticky, but that&apos;s to be expected from a long standing breakfast joint. 

If you&apos;re in Seattle you have to try this place out. Rain or shine the wait is worth it!","It really feels like a small-town diner. There&apos;s booths like you&apos;d see in the movies and for their wall decorations, it&apos;s all hand-drawn pages taped to their walls with masking tape. It&apos;s not bad, just not a high-end kind of place, but it makes you think more about time with friends and living in the moment. 

Their food is like any diner food. I didn&apos;t think it was that special. My group ordered a 12-egg-omelette called the &quot;triple bypass&quot; or something, and it was piled high. I had like a pancake plate and spilt the farmer&apos;s omelete (6 eggs).  The portion size there is kind of insane. And hash browns are unlimited?? 

It&apos;s definitely an experience, but I don&apos;t think I could go again. It&apos;s a heavy meal.","Best burger there is - gainsbourger, add gruyere and bacon - patio is open, great beer options, great service.","The steak frites here are SO GOOD. One of my first take out meals since quarantine, and it did not disappoint.","I went here a few times before quarantine started and always liked it. It&apos;s the only place in Seattle I found where I could get escargot (I think it&apos;s the first time I had it) and it was really good, not just a thing I ate so I could say I tried it  but something I went back for again. Sandwiches and things were also pretty good. The main draw for me was they had a wide selection of absinthe. I have not ordered delivery since quarantine started, mainly because they can&apos;t deliver the absinthe (and it would be pretty stupid to have that delivered anyway), but I plan to go back when quarantine ends.","Solid escargot indeed. 
Fantastic French Onion Soup.  
Rustic Mushroom appetizer so yummy.  
Baguette perfect.  
Lamb hamburger was impossibly savory.  

The mixed drinks were finely balanced.  

Everything we ordered was deeply enjoyed.  
We&apos;ll be back for sure.","85th and Greenwood Ave French restaurant - why not? The drinks and food are both great. We liked the french onion soup, escargot and steak frites. Voila is still our favorite French restaurant in the city but in a pinch this is a great spot.","An absolutely wonderful experience, our waitress was extremely attentive and had a wonderful suggestions. I had the French onion soup, and it was some of the best French and soup I had an a very long time. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming into town or anyone that&apos;s local!","We came in here with a group of nine people and managed to find a table big enough for all of us! Friendly and fast service. This is a great place to come for a drink or three (especially the cocktails), and they also have a full menu with plenty of vegetarian and even some vegan options. They have a few non alcoholic drinks, I recommend the ginger beer.
Soup of the day was potato leek; vegan, good, but very salty. 
Beet salad was delicious, but it was supposed to have walnuts and instead it had almonds. That&apos;s cool with me, but if I was, say, allergic to almonds and not walnuts and I ate a salad I thought was safe and turned out not to be, that could be deadly. That&apos;s the only reason I&apos;m taking a star off here. I think it&apos;s worth being really careful around substitutions with allergens.","Edith Piaf $10: It had a slightly weird aftertaste to me. I think I&apos;ve learned I&apos;m not into creme de violette. 

Sinthesizer $12: I only tried a sip, but found it too strong for me. 

French Onion Soup $8: Really good! I&apos;d definitely get it again. It was the right balance of savoriness for me. 

Macaronis Et Fromage $14: The mac and cheese is really rich, so the salad is a good side. I usually end up being disappointed in restaurant mac and cheese, but that didn&apos;t happen to me this time!

Frites $5 + Gruyere $1: They had just run out of gravy (late dinner for us around 10:40 PM on a Saturday), so no poutine for us. Poutine was what brought us here in the first place, as the Angry Beaver had their cook go home early so we already had been shut down for poutine once that night. The fries were nice and crispy. They don&apos;t use cheese curds here, so I am curious for next time how the gravy goes with the gruyere. We got a side of garlic aioli that was really tasty!

My Star Ratings: 
1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry. 
2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return. 
3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn&apos;t go out of my way to. 
4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven&apos;t already. 
5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here.","I love the vibe of this restaurant, but I think the food could do with a bit more.

I&apos;ve had the duck breast here, which was kind of overcooked and a bit salty. I&apos;ve √† huge weakness for duck breast and unfortunately this place fell flat. The burger (which is ridiculously cheap) during happy hour also left something to be desired. Worth the price but flavor was lacking, and it was literally just meat on a bun.

Drinks here are pretty solid and I&apos;d definitely come in to enjoy some cocktails over fries and good convo!","Thrilled to find this spot a few blocks down the street while housesitting. Don&apos;t miss the every-day happy hour between 4 and 6 to get lovely craft cocktails, French cuisine and absinthe. (Though the usual prices seemed very fair, in my opinion). My choices were escargots and sauteed mushrooms plus the citrusy Edith Piaf cocktail and Mansinthe (good but pricey - they have eight options for absinthe, so I think I&apos;ll explore one of the others next time). The decor is dark - perfect for escaping a hot summer day, though there are also outside tables for sun-worshippers - with many an Eiffel tower, plus crystal chandeliers and mirrors to pop a bit of light back into the space.","The happy hour is OUT OF THE WORLD. We have been here previously, and had gotten the entrees (steak frites and duck confit) - they were good but not too memorable, other than remembering the huge pile of fries.

This time around, I was craving French onion soup and saw that Gainsbourg serves it, so we made the trek. We were there just in time for the HH menu, and wow. We ordered almost everything on it because it was such a great deal!

Escargot - garlic/butter/herbs, tasty but wish it could be saltier. It comes with a baguette for you to sop the butter in, so no need to order separate baguette 

Baguette - nicely toasted with a generous slab of butter on the side. 

Olives - pretty good quality olives

Burger - we added a slice of gruyere cheese and it was heavenly. Only $7 with the cheese! It was an actual full/meaty burger. For the price, I thought I&apos;d get a smaller burger. 

Fries - a MOUNTAIN amount of fries. For $2. I would&apos;ve liked them to be more crispy, but they were still really delicious.

French onion soup (not on HH menu) - very flavorful! It was tasty but not the French onion flavor I&apos;m use to (I was craving the French onion soup from Mon Ami Gabi in Vegas). 

Happy hour is from 4-6pm everyday, and all day Monday.","Steak Frites and a nice Bordeaux. It&apos;s been too long! Full house tonight. 
Sitting at the bar is one of our favorite things, watching the dance of the Cook&apos;s..
I should mention that there is a duck French dip that kooks yum.","Probably my favorite restaurant in Seattle. Great food, great drinks, fair prices and a really cool atmosphere. steak frites and a bottle of wine is the perfect dinner.","Wandered in here for happy hour during the snowpocAlpyse of February 2019 because the grocery store was licked clean of provisions, and so I thought I&apos;d finally try one of the walkable neighborhood spots. I do believe they were understaffed, combined with very busy, yet I was still completely delighted by the experience.

I loved the Gainesbourger (burger!) with frites. It&apos;s a great happy hour option. Also, their homemade ketchup was totally kickass. Usually I am repulsed by ketchup and imagine that it must be one of satans culinary creations, but Gainesbourg found a way to make it heavenly. Tastes like tomatoes should! 

I would hazard though the ice and slush to eat here again!","I love this place and I&apos;ve been coming here for 10 years. Happy hour is incredible whether a carnivore or not, Lamb burger or beet salad? Heck have one of each Because you can afford it.
I&apos;ve been on the search for a sustainable fish, that is good for me, the environment and that tastes delicious. The steelhead they serve at Gainsbourg is green certified from the Monterey aquarium, is raised in a fjord in Norway where the steelhead are free range to go up the river and come back to the sea. The best thing I&apos;ve had since a local  salmon which of course I can&apos;t eat anymore because remember the Orcas?  Complemented by a perfectly saut√©ed chard and a seasonalcauliflower pur√©e with notes of rosemary and sage. 
Pair it with what you will but I had a seven dollar house viogner and it was perfect. 
Bon app√©tit!","Me and my husband came here on Saturday evening. This place had been on my list for a long time and I was really excited to finally come here. This place is really pretty and romantic! The panting on the wall and dark blue paint looked dramatic. And there was a black and white movie projected on the back wall! 

The place was not that busy when we arrived. When we walked in we seated ourselves which is always a plus since I&apos;m very picky about which tables I prefer. 

The atmosphere was laid back. We started with some wine and snails for appetizer. Wine was great and snails were delicious. We spent rest of the evening with more wine, and some amazing food. My husband got steak which he really enjoyed. I went for duck confit which was cooked to perfection. Overall we had a great time!","Great Happy Hour, nice ambience and friendly staff.  Strongly recommended for everyone except under 21 unfortunately.  I left out a star because they don&apos;t have a seafood appetizer and the quality of the escargot has gone down over the years.","My girlfriend and I love this place soo much. All night happy hour every monday! Fantastic food and great booze. The atmosphere is very relaxing and cheery. The people who work there are great too. Love how you can watch the chefs cook.

This is my happy place.","A dark, moody decor evoking a French bistro, with film noir playing on a loop on the unfinished brick wall. You will feel transported to the carefree, romantic post-war environs of a  boehemian Europe, although the feeling evoked is one of nostalgia as most places in Paris are more open and modern these days. The $4 happy hour escargot sauteed in the classic butter, garlic, parsley satisfies the Parisian craving, but where&apos;s the foie gras? The lamb beef Gainsbuger may not fit  to everyone&apos;s taste, but you will find many items on the menu that appeal to you, so sit back, break off a bit of baguette and revel in the joie de vivre!","Were you ever into the dark, french cafe feel? A little goth or batcaver or something like that...with drippy candles in the middle of your table?   Here it is again. This place reminds me of the Seattle of the 1990&apos;s with funky decorations and a dark candle lit feeling. It reminds me of the good ol&apos; days before everything had to be high ceilings and sterile. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I like clean and this place is clean, but it&apos;s not so cookie cutter.

Plus...here is the trick about this little french spot.  Get the escargot. Yup, eat the snails. I dare you there are so good. All the food I&apos;ve had here is delicious as are the drinks.  Steak Frites? Yup...good. Croque Madame.. .also tasty... skip the meat and get sauteed mushrooms on a sandwich... Also excellent. 

Twice I&apos;ve done 12-15 person business dinners, Meetings and even celebrated a birthday here and they are excellent to deal with. Just make a reservation and you are all good.  Now go party like it&apos;s 1999.","I like Roxy&apos;s, and this salad operation is clearly run out of Roxy&apos;s (the Roxy&apos;s breakfast promo insert in my delivery bag gave it away).  The cobb salad was underwhelming compared to a place like Evergreens.  It&apos;s just romaine lettuce, some bacon, and some blue cheese, and some egg.  The menu on Postmates said the cobb salad would come with turkey slices and ham, but I see neither on my salad.  Also, I ordered Kimchi Mayo dressing and was given balsamic dressing... wth?  I&apos;m giving two stars because I WANT this place to be good.  They need to ADD more ingredients!",This place is a joke! DO NOT BUY FOOD FROM HERE. A $16 salad came with 2 leaves of lettuce? Horrible quality.,"I ordered the falafel waffle supreme vegan via DoorDash. I assumed this would be a salad however there was no lettuce. Luckily I was at home so I just used some of my own. The feta, sliced red onion, banana pepper and cucumber were good but the falafel was very very hard. I broke it in to pieces because it was too hard to eat as is.",My salad and sweet potato fries were good. Nothing to write home about but pretty average.  Generous portions and great flavor. Better then I would get at the grocery store.,Forgot the meat on the Caveman Cobb and forgot the dressing for the Cobb. I&apos;ve been trying to call the restaurant to obtain a refund but the call isn&apos;t going through....,"Their Cobb Salad consists of way over salted dark meat chicken, barely any blue cheese, nice pieces of bacon, too many eggs and greens. It&apos;s not a real restaurant, it&apos;s just Roxy&apos;s backdoor. I feel like they take their leftovers and turn them into salad, hence the pastrami on the &quot;Caveman Cobb&quot;. If you didn&apos;t already know, they also run &quot;Meatball Revolution&quot; out of their kitchen. Again, not a separate restaurant, just a pretend restaurant run out of the same kitchen. That&apos;s not great, but that&apos;s for another page...","We were lucky to get a seat for the Yurt Village.

The village itself was unbelievably cool, a great gaggle of tents with a central walkway between them, each themed uniquely outdoorsy.

Service was prompt, friendly, and appreciative of the business. Very covid conscious and safe.

In typical Canlis fashion, food was creative and delicious. Cocktails were delicious as well.

If you can sneak in, grab a spot in the village for a cool winter treat.","I have to say one of the highlights during this pandemic was Canlis. For them to be able to think of new ideas, get creative, to still try and get people coming to their restaurant was exactly what we needed during this time. I did not personally participant in the drive in movie and other pop ups they had but I was able to participant in the Crab Shack! 

I took my mom for her birthday and it was absolutely amazing! I loved the atmosphere! They definitely decorated and played the part of a crab shack! The process went smoothly. You pull up car by car and you waited until they told you that you were able to enter. They took your temperatures before you walked in and asked you the common COVID questions. 

We were seated and all of the staff waiting on the patrons wore masks. There was even hand sanitizer at each table. Our waitress was outstanding and really friendly! 

Now for the main event, the meal. Wow oh wow! So much food we had to take some home! We had some much crab and I&apos;m glad we went before they eventually changed it to only half a crab. (Bummer for those that didn&apos;t get to experience a whole Dungeness crab). It was very delicious! The salmon dip and chips we got as starters was also quite tasty. I couldn&apos;t put it down! 

All in all everything was great! We had a fantastic experience and a great time! Way to be so innovative during a pandemic! It was very much appreciated to experience something different and so on point with the theme! Hopefully when the pandemic is over Canlis can continue to be creative and innovative!","We&apos;ve done a LOT of the weekly delivery (earlier in the pandemic) &amp; pick-up meals!!  It&apos;s pricey, but SO worth it!  What a fun way to experience Canlis, especially if you wouldn&apos;t typically spend $$$$ prices. There&apos;s nothing like an actual in-restaurant Canlis experience. But, since that&apos;s not an option, due to the pandemic, this is the next best thing.  The food is top quality and the menu is so fun &amp; interesting!  I love the included menu (always with a lil&apos; flower attached), and add on some cocktails &amp; you&apos;ll be in Canlis heaven!","We finally got to try Canlis for our anniversary last year (October 2019) and it did not disappoint. We were extremely impressed with our whole dinner experience from the moment we walked into the restaurant until we got in our car :) I would definitely 100% recommend going here for special occasions or if you just feel like splurging a little bit, it&apos;s totally worth it! 

Everything we tried on the menu was very pretty and delicately plated. The flavors were so interesting and different yet super delicious. It&apos;s the overall experience that made everything so superb! The service, the food, the interior, the atmosphere! Loved everything about it. 

It really makes sense why they are ranked one of the best restaurant in Seattle -- can&apos;t wait to go back again once it&apos;s safe to dine in!!","Canlis is truly a gem. Living on Seattle for years, I finally got the opportunity to dine with them right before the pandemic stay at home order hit in March 2020. I had several dishes that were Japanese inspired - there were hints of Japanese flavors / using Japanese ingredients but I think I prefer non-fusion type dishes for next time since I like dishes to taste authentic. Nonetheless the quality of the dishes were spectacular. The courses are very filling and I was bummed out to not be able to finish the dessert souffl√©. Definitely a place to spend a special night and I cannot wait for the pandemic to end and dine with them again. The service is phenomenal too - the staff was very professional and knowledgeable.

During the stay at home order, I also tried the take home meals that included Painted Hills rib-eye and also a breakfast kit to make blueberry pancakes. It was the first time I tried the meat from that farm: again, excellent quality and very generous quantity!","This is a review before the pandemic. This restaurant is perfection to the max. Everything is perfectly cooked, every flavor just works with everything they serve from the salad to the desert there was nothing that tasted bad. I am a hard critic and I cannot say anything bad about the service or experience at Canlis. They made us feel special and even the desert had a happy anniversary on it. I am sure they will continue to have great service and experience for every customer that comes in.","Had the most memorable and fantastic experiences at Canlis! We were visiting Seattle for our engagement photos and wanted to dine at Canlis. i found out they were doing different themed pop ups in their parking lot and Discovered they had just released their &quot;crab shack&quot; concept! I immediately bought tickets when they went live online  (which sell out fast btw) and was so glad I did!!

Hands down one of our favorite dining experiences pre and post covid!! They made everything feel safe - huts were individualized and everyone was spaced out more than 6 feet. Minimal contact with servers, temperature check before entering, hand sanitizers everywhere and masks required!

With that out of the way : the food was spectacular !! Their theme and concept was super fun - sunken ships, tiki huts, crabs, jeeps, and fish nets etc! The ticket includes rolls, Dungeness crab for each person, sea salt and vinegar chips with smoked fish dip, corn, tomato salad and fruit galette! Side note i simplified their descriptions and didn&apos;t give it enough justice but they all had great flavors, fresh ingredients and delicious!!

Make sure you get your tickets for their pop up concepts! So fun, safe and delicious","Well you already know this restaurant deserves to get their 5 starts.
hell of a good place that taste like heaven.
standards is very high from the valet guys who parks your car to your server who takes your order.
Food is serve on a very high level,
Looks like a million dollar,before tax,
Food Taste like a -$400 in your bank account,
But in a good way. 
I&apos;m willing pay top dollar as long as I get good value for my money.
I actually came there with my dog,
On our way out of the restaurant he crashed his head into the glass because it was so clean. 
Everybody laughed. me too.the dog didn&apos;t. He crashed his head and didn&apos;t got to have a peace from the steak.how bad is that?

Anyways,
Great place guy.
If you got some extra $$$$ then go check them out.
Will def be back when I&apos;ll be able to gather some hungry yelpers around  who willing to rob a bank with me so we can go there again.",Recently had my first experience. Loved the yurts! The decor was great and I was surprised how warm I stayed. Every bite was delicious and the service was great. It lived up to the hype.,"THIS IS WHERE I GOT ENGAGED! Did I know this was where it would be? Did I hint at this being the perfect place for it to be? Did I tell him I wanted to go here? The answers to all that was NO.

Looking back on it, this was the perfect place for us to get engaged. I would say I have foodie tendencies and I love food so going somewhere with fine dining and amazing food was perfect!

We got there a little early and if you have ever been you know that it is a valet type drop off. You turn into where the restaurant is located and right there is the front door with a little covered area. They open the doors for you and you hand them the keys.

Once you are inside, there is a bench to the left and the bathrooms. On the right  you walk a little further in to see the dining room to the left and another seating area on the right with a fire place right in front of you.

If you get there a little before the first reservations when they just open, you may catch a glimpse of their staff meeting. That is what happened to us. We were not greeted by anyone or asked for coats immediately like you probably would be if you were not in the first round of reservations. Someone did come over though shortly after to take out coats away.

Once the staff meeting ended, which you could hear little bits and pieces of, the staff member assigned to your reservation comes over and asks to take you to your table.

THIS IS WHERE IT HAPPENED. I had never been to Canlis before so when we started walking up the stairs I did not know I was being led to their private room. The view from up there was amazing and would definitely be a good space for special occasion or group event. They even have a small bar up there as well.

If you get engaged here, they also give you champagne right after.

Once everything went down, we were led over to the private dining room. This had a small little couch and a table set for two. The view in this room was just as amazing as the big private event area. You could see parts of the city and gasworks park. I was very happy to be able to see the view in the day time and at night with all the night lights.

For the meal, I was still in shock so it took me forever to even pick up the menu and read it. I started with the drink menu and ordered what was recommended. Throughout the night I had the champagne, I think the Millionaire and something else that was fruity which I asked for as recommended. The two cocktails were very good.

For the food, we ordered:

ONE
CHAWANMUSHI (Japanese egg custard with hedgehog mushroom and geoduck)
CARAMELIZED MUSSELS (Pine nut &quot;green curry&quot; with geoduck XO sauce)

TWO
FRIED RABBIT (Yoshoku potatoes, buttermilk, and herbs from our garden)
GRILLED CARROTS (Glazed in reduced blackberry jam with chorizo and clams)
HAIGA RICE (In brown butter dashi with Dungeness crab, fried chili, and hazelnuts)

We were only meant to have two from course two but the Rabbit was given to us by accident and I am grateful it was because that was probably the best one out of the three dishes.

THREE
DRY AGED RIBEYE (Gratin of potato and fermented cabbage, with sauce Pierre)
SEA BREAM (Stewed onions, horseradish, and flavors of oyakodon)

FOUR
SWEET POTATO (Japanese sweet potato with bee pollen garam, yuzu sherbet, and cocoa butter cake)
AGED CHEDDAR AND APPLE (French toast, apple chutney, yogurt ice cream, and Petit Pomerol cheddar)

I did not know it would also start with bread and a bunch of small started plates but it did and each of those small bites were delicious. Everything about the meal was delicious. We even got a side of truffle fries which was in fine print on the menu and I love my fries so they were a perfect addition.

After the meal, which we took our time enjoying, we were taken on a tour around the restaurant with an option of some sort of drink to carry around. Learning about the history, seeing the kitchen, the wine cellar and the champagne room was really cool. If I was not as still in shock and semi tipsy, it probably would have been even better.

At the end of our Canlis experience, we were thanked for dining with them and greeted with our coats being heated up by the fire place. I loved everything about this experience and will definitely be going back one day.","I have always wanted to try Canlis, and still am looking forward to the chance to try the traditional Canlis experience once it is safe to do so. However, in the meantime trying Canlis&apos; innovative way of doing business and staying afloat has been awesome.

When they did the Bagel pop-up we picked up one morning and it did not disappoint. The only better bagel I&apos;ve had is from Mt. Bagel!

However, the &quot;Canlis Crab Shack&quot; was amazing and such a great experience. Most fine dining restaurants are known for their service, and despite the more casual experience with the Crab Shack, the service was incredible - so friendly and kind. 

We went on a beautiful night and had a blast shucking our own crab. The apps were lovely and we had a great bottle of WT Vinters wine. Would recommend if you can snag a reservation. 

Excited to see what Canlis does next in the Covid-era!","Lovely experience.

Came here during a work trip for a celebration, food was pleasant, service was delightful, views were amazing. Overall a 5-star experience.

Flavors were greatly influenced by Japanese cuisines/snacks. Also they use glasses from sghr, my favorite!","Canlis really takes into account technique and presentation. Only reason why its not 5 stars - I thought it was overhyped and was expecting amazing dishes for the price point. 

Service is always good. This is my second time coming and the service is always amazing and consistent.

However as mentioned the food is done well but no wow factor! really wish there was something a little bit more unique.","This is more like a experiencing restaurant, which you start to enjoy the service right after arriving the valet parking area. 

I was expecting to see the same menu as I saw on yelp, yet, they do change their menu seasonally. Meanwhile, the price also increased a bit. They also provide four extra light dishes, which include the deserts before and after your main courses and the Canlis bread. 

My main course was the pork, and it was my first time seeing the raw pork as a dish, so I asked to make it well done, but it was still not well done until I asked the second time. Our server told me that it was delicious, but I will still not recommend it, and you will understand if you do some research online. 

All the dishes here are pretty sour in overall, which is very appetizing, but the Canlis salad was too sour. 

Service charge is included and the valet parking is free.","I&apos;ve been to Canlis many years ago for dinner but haven&apos;t been back since due the restaurant being quite pricey. With COVID-19 affecting our area, the owner did the best thing by creating three separate drive thrus to help Seattle out. The second one (Canlis Drive-on Thru) starts at 11:00 am and consists of burgers, veggie melts, Canlis salads, citrus sodas, or an ice cream sandwich option. I really wanted to try this out as I had heard and seen rave reviews about the burgers. My bf and I parked down below along Dexter Ave and walked up to place our order. We found that faster than waiting in line with the car. 

The wait was only about 25 minutes and we decided to eat at Thomas Wales Park down the hill. The burger was actually amazing! The beef just melted in my mouth with every bite and the sauce over the carmelized onions were a great combination.  The fries were good but just a bit too salty for me. The ice cream sandwich I wasn&apos;t too impressed with I felt that it was not worth the $5 but the citrus soda was quite refreshing. Overall I recommend trying the burger if you can and kudos to Canlis for doing this for our area!","This, friends, is my one thousandth review. I have been holding off writing it since my first Canlis visit, and have been there a few times since.

I am usually not a person who goes in for &apos;the traditional thing&apos; - I don&apos;t subscribe to other&apos;s ideas of what money can and should buy, I also am not a person who spends a lot on a dinner out regularly, but I know enough about fine dining to understand what Canlis does, and just how well they do it.

From the moment you arrive, whether as a bar patron or a dinner guest, you are treated like a welcomed friend. Valet out front is always perfectly friendly and efficient, the warm fire on cold Seattle days greets you, a lovely human offers to take your coat.  

If you start in the bar, or end in it, you&apos;ll go in and see the peeking views across the valley outside.  You may sit at a table, or saddle (side, English for this, no western here) up to the bar, you&apos;ll be treated to a menu of both traditional (with a twist) and unique cocktail options.  These will always be the best drinks you&apos;ve ever had. Always. The service will always be charming and impeccable. Always.

You may order some bar bites, they will be delicious. No need to hesitate on what to order, although it&apos;d be a shame if you didn&apos;t try those fries.

But while the bar feels like you&apos;ve slipped into some kind of movie where you&apos;re the unexpected star, the dinner service is even more. 

From the minute you sit down, until you walk out, usually with a small white box of goodies to take home, you will have an experience that will be- while definitely not by most means affordable- worth every dollar, and will set a new standard for what the marriage of perfect food, perfect service and that je ne sais quoi that Canlis has perfected is.

This is where you go to celebrate a triumph, a milestone birthday, a loss that needs to be salved. This is where you go to remind yourself- or your loved one- that you are singularly ready to step into the warm spotlight for a few hours, to sit and enjoy life in a way that only Canlis can facilitate.

After my first visit, I was honestly shocked that I felt like I was now on the other side of &quot;Oh, now I get it&quot;of the reputation here, and the reason that a restaurant that was built before I was born, run by the same family, seeped in a tradition I don&apos;t normally subscribe to was now what would always be &apos;the standard for excellence.&apos;

Go. Do it. You&apos;ll wonder why you&apos;ve waited this long.","Canlis has amazing food, exceptional staff, a well-curated wine list, and a beautiful view.  During the pandemic, Canlis stepped up and gotten creative, showing a funner side to Canlis than I typically see in its rather formal dining room.   It&apos;s been really so cool to experience.","It feels weird to give such a highly spoken of restaurant a mediocre review - but maybe it&apos;s just because we came to the lounge vs. the full restaurant. I came here for a work dinner and sat in the lounge since we had only planned a week ahead of time.  We learned that they longer serve the full menu in the lounge, so we ordered drinks and shareable plates. The staff was happy to adjust the quantities on each item so that our group could each have a bite (literally what you should expect from the shareable in the lounge) - which I appreciated! 

I enjoyed their large wine menu! They had a live pianist that night, which added to the classy atmosphere overlooking the lake/city lights. It really is a beautiful venue! 

While they did notice some details (folding your napkin for you if you got up for the restroom), I felt like the staff was inconsistently trained or experienced. Our experience of one waiter/waitress was different from the next - their level of touch and detail was noticeable. One waiter would explain in detail the item they brought to the table and check back in, others would wait for us to move things around the table to make the dish fit and then leave. Not major, but a detail I would expect to be handled at such a nice restaurant. 

I also found the food to be good, but not exceptional for the price. So that&apos;s why I&apos;m giving it an a-ok!","Came here tonight for drinks and small bites in the lounge. We got here around 5:30 PM and got a table. The drinks were delicious! I ordered a few of the signature cocktails from their menu - you could tell each was carefully crafted. Best cocktails I&apos;ve ever had. 

We also had gotten a few small bites - truffle fries, pork lumpia (spring rolls), oysters, and potato korokke. The pork lumpia was delicious! My fav off the lounge menu. I found the potato korokke too oily and had no taste other than just being a fried potato. 

Like the other reviews, our car was waiting for us once we had settled our bill.

My husband did not wear a sport coat - we were only in the lounge and I believe this is totally acceptable. 

Definitely be back for drinks in the near 


My husband and I returned for drinks - once again, great service by the staff. So accommodating - the bar was full but within minutes had two seats available at the bar top. The bartender was great - the millionaire and high tide are my fav drinks; they are very strong. For about six drinks my husband and I spent around $100. I&apos;ll happily return.","I heard I could die happy once I ate at Canlis. Might be true for an individual, but I came as a corporate function with a set menu. The service is none other and the waiters were all very kind. The food was definitely exquisite...  But I don&apos;t think that type of fine dining is for me. Treat yourself if you can!","Bartender tonight was so kind.
I asked if they sold cigarettes, but he informed me that they did not. He came up to me a few minute later and said that a pack had been left and gave it to me.
Nice vibe in the bar for a night cap.
Thank you.
CASH ONLY BAR","Dank lighting, funky smell, faded formica, vinyl half booths, stale chips, surly staff, stray dogs, irregular regulars, janky pool table. Stay away. You&apos;ll just ruin it.",Really nice people running this place. Great bluegrass jam on Monday nights 10pm.,"Aime Seattle blue grass vibe with great assortment of beverages, especially local IPAs... Service great!","Update: I&apos;m going with Brad F&apos;s strategy to give it an anti-rating. This bar is too good as it is; too good to be ruined by hordes of kids sullying it with their inanity. This place is as good as it gets.

It&apos;s a neighborhood bar; lots of regulars; I-Dream-Of-Genie decor; never crowded. The bartenders are cool and you can talk to them. Come in for Sunday football and they&apos;ll probably change the channel to what you want to watch. They have a good selection of taps (incl. my running faves from Fremont Brewing Co.).

Skinny jeans, goth punk, neighborhood drunks in shorts and cross-trainers, industry types all occupy the same space just fine here. Don&apos;t be a douche, dig the low-volume vibe, chill out with your amigos and you&apos;ll probably love this place too. Oh, and bring cash. And unless you want some pickled eggs, eat before you come.",Looks exactly the same as it did when I lived in Wallingford 12 years ago. It&apos;s not well-marked at all. 50 cent pool table. Pac-man tabletop totally works. Bar is cash only. Very opinionated and excellent but broken jukebox - please fix it?,"Cool dive bar, decent beer selection. Not pretentious and nice bartender always elevates a place in my book! Oh, and a really strong free Wi-Fi signal! That&apos;s awesome!","Upon arriving, it was clear that I had stumbled into the sort of establishment that I was unacostumed to.

Carpet was exceptional
Staff was most lovely
Drinks flowed as milk and honey

I recommend","This place is a shithole and it smells weird.  It&apos;s also spacious and the bartender seems like a nice guy.

Look, this place really deserves 3 stars but from a pinball players perspective I can only give it 2 because of the way they jammed the fucking pinball machine behind some booth (see photos) and there was a broom leaning up against it (again, see photos).  I don&apos;t want to play pinball with some broom leaning against the machine.  

There was a weird smell.

The only machine they have is Dr. Who and they don&apos;t have a machine to get quarters.  It seemed like a decent place (besides the smell) but not really a great place to play pinball although the machine was in good/decent shape.","No place on earth like Al&apos;s. There will never be another place like this.

Ass holes, douche bags, frat boys, please stay away.

Pay cash and tip generously. David deserves it.","Let me be clear on this. I love this place. Might be my favorite bar in the neighborhood. The one star rating is for the good of the bar and it&apos;s regulars.

How do you think the pain in the ass UW kids find out about places like this? yelp. Al&apos;s is about 10 more 5-star ratings from being a bar right off Fremont ave. Do you want that?

Preserve the Al&apos;s Tavern that&apos;s been doing its thing since 1940. Keep a great neighborhood bar great for once.","10pm on a Wednesday my boyfriend and our dogs head to Al&apos;s. (I had called ahead to confirm they were indeed dog-friendly.) Even though Al&apos;s is right on NE 45th, it&apos;s easy to miss. The only sign is a sidewalk easel board. 

The regulars undoubtedly like it that way. Apparently they give Al&apos;s 1-star reviews on yelp so as not to attract new clientele. It&apos;s easy to see why the regulars are so fond of Al&apos;s Tavern. Established in 1940, the tavern is cozy and kooky. The beers are cheap, and the hipster watching is superb!

Read my full (dog friendly Seattle) review here: http://doggoneseattle.com/als-tavern-in-wallingford/","Favorite bar in seattle. Simple, no frills, stiff drinks, friendly bartenders, and improv bluegrass on Monday nights. Cash only, but totally worth it.","Al&apos;s is probably my favorite bar in the &apos;hood. The bartenders are friendly, cozy atmosphere, cheap dranks, close proximity to Dick&apos;s. This place would bee heaven on earth if only they had delicious tots. I realize all of their food is prepared via toaster oven, so I&apos;m not expecting perfection, but Al&apos;s would be a major contender if they stepped up their tot game. For the thyme being, when I want booze &amp; snacks, I will have to take my business to Leny&apos;s or the Pacific Inn, where the tots reign supreme. Also, the olives here taste like they have been soaking in Windex, maybs when they clean the bar the olives are subjected to cleaning products? 1. get better tots 2. protect the olives 3. profit $$$$$$$$","This place is crap. I went down there with a bunch of my frat-boy friends and totally had a lame time. I ordered 10 PB&amp;J shots for my brothers and the bartender rolled his eyes! If you are looking for a run-down dump where IZOD is not appreciated, this is the place for you. If you like the awesomeness that frat-boy bars bring, this is not the place at all. Boo! And, they only accept cash?! How primitive is that?","This bar is making me consider moving to Seattle.

A few weeks ago my boyfriend and I went out to Seattle for a funeral. We are both from and live in Philadelphia so one night, we decided to take the bus in the direction of downtown. About 15 minutes from our hotel, we stumbled upon this place. 

From the outside we knew we were going to like it. 

Al&apos;s Tavern has the same Philly dive bar feel, except everyone is exponentially nicer. 

The bartender was a sweetheart, all of the people that we met were sooo nice. What a breath of fresh air from the dickheads on the east coast.

Go here, SERIOUSLY! cheap drinks and good people.","So I walk in.  I&apos;m meeting friends but they aren&apos;t there yet.  I walk up to the bar and wait my turn.  And I wait.  And I wait.  The bartender repeatedly serves people who have come to the bar after me, without so much as looking at me.  Finally she practically snarls at me, asking what I want.  I tell her I want the porter.  She asks for my ID and it takes me a minute to dig it out, which clearly puts her in so much pain that she nearly dies right there at the bar.  Finally I find it, she looks at it, and then asks me what I want again.  I tell her the porter.  A mason jar of the stuff slams down on the counter in front of me. I offer a card and she stares at me as though I&apos;ve just crawled out of the sludge and am growing legs right in front of her.  &quot;We don&apos;t do CARDS here.&quot;  

One of the regulars at this point takes pity on me and points out the ATM, but I have a twenty in my pocket for once and offer that instead.  I&apos;m so flustered by her bitchiness that I actually forget to tip and only remember once I&apos;m sitting down...but I decide I&apos;m not too worried.  (Of course, when I go for my second jar a bit later, the service is even worse.)  

The atmosphere sucks.  I like a good dive bar, but this place is trying a little too hard.  The beer jars suck.  Are they the pint size? They feel smaller.

I liked that there was a dog in the bar, but I wish that he had been pulling the taps because all dogs automatically get five stars from me.  

I won&apos;t be coming back here.  Why would I when there are several places on 45th where the bartenders know my name and actually want my business?","Als is an awesome bar. I love the mural, the bartenders and drinking out of an old jar. I usually go alone and check out the peeps. There are all types. When I do bring friends, they also think its way cool.","Awesome bar. Loved the atmosphere and the bartender ruled. Very attentive and friendly. I like dark dive bars and this is definitely one of those. Cheap, strong drinks is just what I like and that&apos;s just what they serve. Came here on a Saturday night and managed to find a seat just fine. We will be coming back for sure.","When the kids can&apos;t get away from their studies long enough to make it to Cha Cha they head to Al&apos;s. My assumption was that I would enjoy Al&apos;s given that I have a sensible friend who frequents the place. I expected Al&apos;s to be an oasis amongst the sad little spots along 45th. But Al&apos;s is a serious disappointment. Nothing but hipsters frequent this place and their vulgarities are disarming not to mention countless. I am almost convinced the scenesters here take themselves seriously. At any moment one of them may lean over and confess that it wasn&apos;t a choice but rather a way of life. Oh preach on mix tape.

No funny ha-ha here a la Cha Cha lounge, oh nay nay. Mocking the patrons isn&apos;t a sport at Al&apos;s like it is at the Cha Cha. It may be the set-up, not quite sure, but for whatever reason there is no good clean fun to be had at the expense of the ironic set. For those reasons I would never venture to Al&apos;s on my own ever. I would never go out of my way to go to Al&apos;s or suggest it like it is a good idea or something. However, being the eternal optimist, Al&apos;s redeems itself by giving patrons a good pour. At Al&apos;s the drinks are strong and cheap. Just be aware of the after affects. One could be vomiting from the alcohol or the Rivers Como impersonators singing Morrissey at the top of their lungs...or both.","Haven&apos;t been here in a few years but was glad to see things haven&apos;t really changed much! I ordered a hot toddy and a lamb deluxe burger after a long bike ride and it totally hit the spot. My friend ordered the regular non deluxe lamb burger and to be honest, I&apos;d likely get that next time as the bacon addition wasn&apos;t worth the extra $1.50 because it was a small amount of crumbled bacon on top of the burger. They&apos;re doing both outdoor and indoor seating and I opted for the outdoor seating and they were appropriately distanced apart. Can&apos;t wait to come back and try more things on the menu - their mussels and fries looked great at another table.","They have a great lamb burger! Fries came out too salty, but I think it&apos;s because they are seasoned with the mussels in mind. If you don&apos;t get the mussels, I would recommend asking for less salt on the fries. They have a great beer and whiskey selection. The staff is pleasant and knowledgeable. Covid social distancing policies are definitely enforced. Parking was easy when I went.","Bored of the beers available at your grocery store? Drop by Brouwer&apos;s for more options that you can imagine! Bring a growler or pick up some bottles. Either way, it&apos;s a great way to try out something new (which we are all in desperate need of these days!)","Brouwer&apos;s is a longtime favorite in Fremont - I work right across the street, and the classic European pub atmosphere is perfect for unwinding at the end of a long day, or going for a casual date.  Three things you need to know about Brouwer&apos;s: beer, mussels, frites.  

Beer: Brouwer&apos;s has a beer you will love, I promise.  They have 64 taps, plus a wall-to-wall glass chiller chock full of bottles from probably any specialty brewery in the country you can name.  If you can&apos;t find something you like here, you don&apos;t like beer.  

Mussels: get the traditional mussels.  Order an extra baguette.  You&apos;ll need it to soak up all the leftover sauce because you do NOT want that goodness going to waste.  Perfect size for splitting if you&apos;re not starving, and a filling meal if you are.  

Frites: the mussels come with frites, so if you&apos;ve been taking my advice so far, you&apos;re good to go.  If you&apos;re not quite hungry enough for the shellfish, just get a big ol&apos; plate of frites to split with the beautiful people you&apos;re with.  Or just for yourself, I don&apos;t judge.  They&apos;ll be among the best fries you&apos;ve ever had, I guarantee it...and make sure you get the dragon sauce.  You&apos;re welcome.  

Oh and if you&apos;re more of a whiskey guy or gal, fear not, they have over 100 single-malt options for you to choose from.  You&apos;re in good hands here, friends.","Amazing place with great food, awesome ambiance and an incredible beer selection! Such a fun place to pop into for a drink and apps. Always a great option for your pub crawl list","Brouwer&apos;s is a great place for some fry cravings with an assortment of dipping sauces to choose from. It&apos;s one of my favorites even though I&apos;m not a beer drinker. They have about 64 beers on tap, bottles you couldn&apos;t even count and a full bar. They always have specialty cocktails that are actually good for a beer focused clientele and I don&apos;t say this lightly.

I typically get the steak frites but last time I tried the &quot;seafood&quot; which I would most definitely get again. The cheese melt on top was a bit weird but the overall flavor was amazing. My friend got the Cioppino and thought it hit the spot.

Happy Hour bites must have is the pretzel has great flavor and a awesome texture

*unless you get to sit above on the second level then 5*","Super impressed with their large selection of beers here. I had the Alpenfire Glow Rose Cider ($9 for 6oz so a little bit pricey imo) &amp; Blackberry Lassi and loved them both. Foods was tasty and we definitely will come back for more. 

Love the atmosphere of this bar. It could get crowded but tables are very far apart so you still have your privacy.
 
Service was not great when we were there on a Friday night. Our server does not seem to understand the menu well as I was asking for ingredients in couple dishes and he did not know what they were. He also forgot one of our dish and we had to walk to the bar later to order additional drinks.","Had drinks and apps here yesterday. Felt like we were transported from Seattle to a pub in Europe. Extensive drink list (drafts, bottles, wine and spirits) with plenty of sizes to choose from. Personally appreciated the 10-15 cider options. We ordered oysters and meatballs to snack on and they were both great. Good prices and they have happy hour every day until 6 too!

Plenty of seating at the bar as well as the tables. We saw several large parties being set up (tables of 12+). Seems like a great place for a group gathering.","Belgian pub in Fremont. The space inside has high ceilings with most of the seating on the main floor and lofts on both sides. It has a really cool European pub in a stone building kind of atmosphere. It&apos;s also quite dark so your eyes will need some adjusting if you exit the building on a bright day. It&apos;s also a 21+ establishment, so bring your ID.

The place was not too crowded for weekday lunch. The beer menu has a really good selection. Tried a trappist-style beer and it was good and also quite strong. As for food, I ordered the mussels with fries (pomme frites). Was expecting a plate of mussels, but they brought out a pot with about 40 mussels inside. Took me a while to eat it all, and it tasted pretty good. Also included a whole plate of fries that I just couldn&apos;t finish. Good food, good beer, good atmosphere.","LOVED. While visiting Seattle, I decided to bring my boyfriend here for his birthday and it was AMAZING. The food, the vibes, atmosphere, drinks, service, everything!

The space felt very cozy yet grand. The dim lights and decorations were super cool!

When we saw how Insanely extensive the draft beer selection was, we didn&apos;t even know where to begin. We tasted a few and they were all great. My favorite drink of the night was a California Ros√© blend, very me.

The food was also delicious. We started off with the oyster which were delightful. Being that we were on the West Coast, of course I had to go for seafood, so I ordered the Rockfish and Frites. Very satisfying! 

We will definitely be visiting this spot once more when in Seattle!","I cannot say enough good things about the food. It was even more shocking because we weren&apos;t really expecting much (it&apos;s bar food in a beer hall? So it doesn&apos;t have to be special?). We ordered a pretzel (with two different dipping sauces that were both fantastic), the falafel burger (amazing, made with goat cheese and a chutney and the best bun) and the croque madame (also just really good). Plus there was a garlicy dipping sauce and curry ketchup and fries. An easy five stars.","Great location in Fremont. I would highly suggest it as a date location.

So many beers to try! Only hard part was the beers being on the menu by location instead of the style. 

Ordered the muscles and fries! Must have. Fries are very crispy and you get to choose a dip. We went with the garlic aioli. The muscles are very good as well. The broth/sauce they come in is amazing. We got extra bread to make sure we ate all the broth. 

Lamb burger and soup. You can get the burger with fries (we already had some from the muscles) so we went with soup. Clam Chowder. I liked it a lot. LOTS of clams and bacon. Not a lot of potato. Thick and creamy. Lamb burger was not very good. I had about 2 bites and gave up. So much other things on the table to enjoy.","Brouwer&apos;s how I love you so! One of my favorite pubs, ever. Mostly because the best frites I&apos;ve ever had can be found here--as an app, under some delicious stew in the stoofvlees, paired with saucy clams or a burger, with ~6 dipping sauces to choose from... I&apos;d have these frites all day any day. Frites aside, the many Bavarian-inspired menu items and rotating specials are all top notch, seasonal, and creative. Happy hour (3-6 pm) is also awesome, and features sizable shareable noms.

The cherry on top is fantastic service. Inside, it&apos;s spacious, chill, and unique. Friendly neighborhood pub vibes emanate from this spot, and I aspire to be a regular here!

Protip: Monday&apos;s are perfect for checking out the very extensive bottle list, as bottles are 20% off!","Never had a problem with service here so I cannot really comment on that. However, their moules frites are spot on and the portion is so big, it is easily sufficient for two people. 

Super extensive beer list (Belgian, duh) and they can get real pricey, real quick but so what - so can wine. My main qualm with this place is that it is always so dark.","This place definitely has one of the most extensive beer lists I&apos;ve seen in Seattle.  

Service is not a priority here; its never been in the five years I&apos;ve frequented this bar.  I suppose I know that service, as well as food and drinks will take time and a prayer so when I stop into this food church I feel like that&apos;s part of the old village/grungy Fremont vibe.  Main point: if you are on the clock, then go somewhere else. 

I always order the lamb burger.  It&apos;s consistently juicy, seasoned well, and cooked to perfection.  The bun is served with some kind of crack in it.  The frites are mini deep fried heart attacks waiting to go off like a bomb upon consumption - but they taste sooooo good.  The dragon sauce is for dipping everything into.  It&apos;s so spicy it makes me cry and want more.  It&apos;s a vicious, circular relationship that the dragon sauce and I share.

To hell with customer service, and cold beer brought during this lifetime. I&apos;m addicted to the siren song of the lamb burger, equally malevolent frites and spellbinding dragon sauce.  I am a loyal minion to this unholy establishment, willing to sacrifice my devotion to good health, and the pillars all respectable restaurants should live and die by.

My conscious says to give this place a three star but my loyalty to this toxic relationship says FIVE star all the way.","I like this place. First of all, I love the interior and ambiance. It feels like you&apos;re transported to another time and place. My friend said it reminded her of something out of Harry Potter. I can definitely see this as an awesome pub to grab an ale with friends. I had the lamb burger, which I enjoyed. The frites that came with the burger were also really good. I appreciate some delicious frites. I also really like their beer and cider selections. I had a delicious cider. Overall, I recommend this place for some tasty food and brews.","Solid place for happy hour! Love their big huge selection of beer (especially their saisons)! 

Happy hour runs from 3-6 with $1 off draft and they&apos;ve got a menu with a bunch of goodies that you can wash down your beer with. I&apos;m a huge fan of their Pomme frites (only $3 for HH!) with the dragon sauce. 

Honorable mentions include their falafel fries and fried cod. 

P.S.  if you&apos;re sitting outside on a warm sunny day, you&apos;ll get huge whiffs of chocolate in the air from Theo&apos;s across the street. Sweet bliss!",Great Belgium pub feel in the heart of Fremont with a great selection of foreign and local ciders and beers. Appetizer plate is well worth the price.,"First off, the atmosphere is very cool.  Almost like something out of a movie set in that there is a horseshoe balcony above the main floor.  Dark color, wood interiors.  Just a good mood.
Our group started with the appetizer plate, which is good, but could use a lot more cheese.  There were just two small pieces on our platter.  The Pommes Frites are wonderful and the spicy Bourbon Dragon Sauce pairs very well with them.
The signature Manhattan&apos;s have a very good flavor, I had to have two! They obviously have an extensive beer, as well as whiskey, list.
Two of us had the Caesar salads with beef and said they were very tasty and not overdressed.  My SO and I shared the beet salad (good) and the Power House Stoofvleez (do NOT ask me how to pronounce it!).  Think of the Canadian  dish, poutine, made with pomme frites and covered in beef with sauce and cheese curds. 
This was a very, yummy dish.  It is not low-cal, but the beef is so very tender and the sauce so full of flavor and perfectly matched with the fries, so who cares??
Service could use a little more warmth, but it was efficient. 
Go early as they don&apos;t take reservations and they fill up fast.","Service : the bartenders are super informative to go over the gin and beer list on a Busy evening .
The bartender kept checking for few times while I was waiting for my friend to join on the bar.
Happy hour menu : The happy hour menu is limited but serves what we look for in a happy hour .

Beer collection : they have a great beer collection , Belgium, sour , local Nd various famous IPA.

Ambience : this place is super unique and interesting . The picture of the creepy smiling guy stands out . This is definitely a brewery to go and try out for locals . This brewery has a upstairs that can be reserved for family or private parties. Which is quite interesting. The restrooms are kept quiet clean. 

Quality : I ordered the fries and rockfish appetizers from happy hour menu . They tasted good.","We just ate at the Baranof restaurant on Greenwood and OmFGoodness(!), we were both entirely impressed! We were told by the owner that they recently hired a new head chef from Mississippi and that the menu had been redesigned. The food here was always great before, but now it seems that everything in the menu could very well be &apos;out of the world&apos; level of AMAZING. We ended up ordering the signature biscuits and gravy (made from scratch) with homestyle potatoes, the signature continental burger (super huge and perfectly prepared caramelized onions, bright red tomato and chipotle mayo on a grilled brioche bun) with fries + pickle spear and a bacon breakfast sandwich for later on brioche bun. The home style potatoes and crispy French fries were each the best I&apos;ve ever had and WOW (: it was all just SO good. Congrats on the renovations and improvements. This has been the most pleasant surprise I can remember since the beginning of COVID 19 LOL.","Owned by racist asshats. This place has always sucked. I&apos;m really gonna enjoy watching them go out of business. 
Byyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeee.","If you wan  a dive bar, want to get your wine in a little airplane size bottle and listen to crazy Karaoke this could be your spot. 

The nautical theme is a a lot of fun. But boy it&apos;s a dirty dirty place with  a nasty bathroom and sticky everything. pretty gross. If you are drunk enough you may not mind. 

Also, the people that come here are super friendly, the bar tenders not so much. They seem pissed to be there. I&apos;ve been about 4 times and they are always grumpy. Maybe that&apos;s the tough vibe they go for? 

All in all, come to hang out and sing and meet new people.  Wear shoes and clothing you don&apos;t care if they get dirty. It&apos;s more like being on a real boat.",The Baranof is a great local dive bar - but it is a dive bar so know what you&apos;re getting into! Don&apos;t be put off by the restaurant in the front. The bar is in the back and difficult to get a sense of from the street. Great karaoke and jello shots!,"I&apos;ve only been here for breakfast on the weekends so that&apos;s all I can comment on. 

The breakfast is quite good and quite cheap. I recommend the eggs benedict. I&apos;ve had this dish 3-4 times now and it&apos;s been good every time. The hollandaise is buttery and stays together nicely. The hash browns always come up crispy and hot.

The atmosphere on the weekends has a relaxed vibe. I have never felt rushed to leave. The owner even asks me if I want to borrow a newspaper when he has one.

I took a star off because it&apos;s pretty dingy inside.

Keep in mind this is a dive, so if that&apos;s not your thing then I don&apos;t recommend this spot.","This is where old alcoholics go to die.  I enjoy this place because after a couple drinks you get to see what a lifetime of alcohol abuse looks like.  I always come out of here feeling like an all-star.  

Ladies, this is the #1 place in Greenwood to get your purse stolen.  

Party on.  Early bird gets the tequila worm at this place.","I love the Baranof. I have been a regular there for about five years. Karaoke is great and it seems everyone likes most of the staff. Food is good, especially for the price. Very down to earth customers, comfortable. Oh, and they have Jell-O shots!","Screw you guys, came in on a Tuesday night, sat in dining room, waited, waited, waited..nobody came around. Went in the bar,  waited, waited, waited for the bartender to finish filling ice or whatever and she still ignored me. Adios...if I want to be ignored I&apos;ll go to my ex-wifes house","Unbelievable! $23 for breakfast?#!
I&apos;ve never felt so ripped off. And the waitress got offensive when I asked why. She said the Irish cream that she drizzled in my coffee was $8. The same breakfast at the same place was $11 just one year ago.  Also the plack on the bar that my friend who passed away purchased was gone.","Omg....after waiting nearly 1 hr for my chicken fried steak brekkie; we left. The waitress had come back to ask what I ordered about 15 mins later. Then another waiter asked if I ordered organic chicken...what?  Hubs ordered a bloody Mary and it came in an old fashion glass...short and full of ice not filled with mix and vodka. We came because of write up in Weekender.
We left and went to Ballard to Hatties. Much better...service and food is top notch! Bloody Mary is excellent.","I wouldn&apos;t come here  again by choice. The service wasn&apos;t good and I got a major stomachache after eating their steak. 
The steak had no flavor and the mushrooms had an acidity taste. I think what was what gave me the stomachache.",now i&apos;ll have to come back... new owner and all...  what a great little local bar... the beat goes on....,This bar is nothing but fun!  stiff drinks and karaoke is awesome!  the lady bartenders are great!  the food is delicious and the drinks are strong!  also i win at pullbtabs when i play there!  im never lucky when i gamble!  lol,"Subpar to mediocre fare served up out of their respective food service cans and boxes by somebody&apos;s surly mom. The well liquor is likely turpentine or Monarch. Either or; they&apos;re equally detrimental. The drinks are poured with a heavy hand so your liver will need a day off if you *do* decide to play alcohol roulette here. 

It&apos;s a proud dive. There are usually a few old guys smoking out front in the mornings. There&apos;s karaoke in the evenings so you can drunkenly laugh at other idiots drunkenly trying to belt out hair band ballads. The Baranof is a solid middle of the road experience, nothing fancy, not that bad.",Couldn&apos;t picture a better Saturday breakfast. Veteran staff that want to charm you and connect with you. Inexpensive comfort food with always extra servings thrown in. Unique murals and decor from another time. This is not a forgettable place. I watched every person who walked in get big ol&apos; smiles. This is a dying breed of restaurant that I want to ensure stays alive.,"Weird, funky Sunday breakfast place. No service at all for 20 minutes, but we were in no rush. Eventually we were treated with humor and good food.",I love this place its a a great lo key dive bar that has awesome food and excellent service me and my fiance love the denver omelets and they are HUGE! I am a ham freak and never want to order a denver omelet because i feel i get less ham in it..not here these babys are loaded with everything! And its hella cheap too. And as for the bar you aint getting a shot measured and pored outa a  fountain gun thats for sure your getting a SHOT WITH ATTITUDE. Good peeps hang there too its old ballard/ greenwood at its finest check it out you wont regret it.,Myself and three friends went to the Greewood Car Show on Saturday June 29th and decided to stop at Baranofs for breakfast. The service was very slow and the servers were not pleasant at all. When our food finally arrived it was a disaster.  The food was absolutely disgusting and tasted like some type of chemicals.  We left the restaurant feeling sick and instantly and ran straight to the restrooms.  The men&apos;s bathroom were disgusting as well. This restaurant should be reported to the Dept of Labor and Industries Health and Safety Board. I was forced to leave one star in order to post this but is not deserving of this dump.,"Wow, what a place! I was told that the drinks were generously poured here and they were!
The people are friendly and the prices were very reasonable. 
What I meant by people was that the service and the clients were all very open to just having a good time, whatever the reason was that they were there for. Everyone had a good time, dancing, singing, and just making the most of the bar that feels like home.","Live close to the Baranof and stop in now and again (earlier the better). Not many bars like this exist in Seattle anymore. Obviously not everyone&apos;s cup of tea, but I appreciate the place. Generous portions when it comes to breakfast and the servers always remember what my order is (creature of habit). Stiff drinks at the bar in the back as well. Seems like regulars have their usual seat at the bar, so I always just order my drink and take a seat at one of the tables. Greenwood is changing fast these days - I&apos;ll be sad if this place leaves.","Anna was kind and provided exceptional customer service! I recently became gluten free due to an allergy, and during a takeout order she took the time to help walk me through what was good on the menu that I can have. She made some great recommendations-- like lettuce wrapped fish tacos rice the elk burger with a GF bun-- that I wouldn&apos;t have known I could order! Then when we went to pick the food up she again leaned in to make sure we were happy with our choices. She went out of her way and was so considerate, something you don&apos;t always get in the Seattle freeze. Not to mention the food was amazing! I&apos;ll definitely be coming back here!","Looking or a good place to get out of a cold Seattle day and watch some football with a great selection of beers on tap. Unfortunately, so cold in the restaurant that we had to leave. Even restaurants with outdoor seating are warmer with heaters than this indoor space. Hope they&apos;ll improve so we can come back in the future.","I decided to check this spot out and was delighted to find the decor to my liking. Nice looking bar in an old building and I found this establishment clean. I had a bowl of their beef stew. Good choice on a cool damp evening.  I am not a beer drinker but they had a huge selection on tap.

Got their early enough to get a nice spot at the bar. Bartenders were attentive enough but they were busy. The Seahawks were on MNF so the place got packed which gave this bar a good vibe (Seahawks won)

I&apos;d go back. Best thing I could find in this area of Seattle. Heads up. Watch you bar bill...it&apos;s a little on the pricey side","We&apos;ve had this spot on our mind for a while now, and finally took a chance.

It wasn&apos;t terribly crowded, though we still waited around 5-10 minutes to be acknowledged. This may have been our fault. We were sitting in the restaurant portion, and the focus definitely seemed to have been on the bar area.

The atmosphere was nice since the hockey finals had just started. I had the Snoqualmie root beer which was an interesting option and plenty filling. My fish tacos were fantastic and definitely the highlight of the night. Unfortunately, my husband&apos;s burger was completely drowned out by brie and the fries were a mediocre side. They also charged us an extra dollar for the drink he ordered, though the table top sign had the price listed as cheaper.

All in all, this was a mixed experience. The fish tacos definitely bump it up a star though.","We came on a Saturday night.  No wait.  Sat right down, ordered right away.  I had a taco salad, it was good.  Gf had the beet salad.  She didn&apos;t like it.  She said it was, &quot;weird and heavy.. mayonnaise-y.&quot; She said maybe it would be better w the dressing on the side. She had never had a beet salad w dressing like that before.  Mine was good.  We also ordered a flourless chocolate cake.  So GOOD.  
We came back after the play, around 10 PM.  There were six if us.  We ordered a water, two beers, a wine, gin and tonic, and a Baileys and coffee.  Service was great.  Staff is pleasant and attentive.  Atmosphere is mellow and relaxed.  I like this place.","Its quarter to 6 and the place is mostly empty but for a sports bar it really is quiet and pleasant.  The service is  prompt and welcoming. The happy hour avocado toast and chipotle shrimp are both really good.
    Nobody blinked when I ordered aue jus with my Cuban sandwich. I would definitely come back because it&apos;s a lot better then the hole in the walls nearby.",I&apos;ve given this place 3 chances. I swore I&apos;d never go back after the second time but my boyfriend had never tried it so I gave it one more chance. Yep... they did it again... HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Staff is so rude. Our waiter slammed my beer on the table and it spilled over. I asked for a coaster and a towel... He delivered the towel. He tossed a bar towel on our table as he cruised by so I could clean it up. That was just one rude thing he did that evening. I&apos;ll leave it at that. The food is ok... Nothing special. It&apos;s a bugger because I live in Greenwood and it&apos;s walking distance from my house. If you want a good burger and better service try Flint Creek (happy hour) or Baranof. Will not go back to The Lodge.,"We were too early for dinner, so none of the restaurants in this neighborhood looked very welcoming.  Lights were on in The Lodge, and it was a spacious location with high ceilings and TVs showing the Sunday games.  In we went.

The menu looked really good - better than expected, actually.  Lots of taps - we order a flight of beer and an Arnold Palmer.  The drinks come out, and we place our food order.  The drinks turned out to be an early warning signal.

I&apos;ve never heard of a bad Arnold Palmer, but my wife did not like it - tasted like diet lemonade, she said. I suppose that could mean they used Crystal Light, or similar; the beer was similarly stale tasting, but that may just have been poor selections on my part as they run specials designed to blow low-running kegs - strike 1.  After 30 min we notice we haven&apos;t seen our server in quite a while, and there&apos;s no sign of our order (which should have taken almost no time given the place wasn&apos;t too busy and we didn&apos;t order anything requiring much in the way of preparation) - strike 2.

We ask another staff member to check on our order.  He returns to say it wasn&apos;t placed, and offers to prioritize it.  We decline, he comps our drinks and we leave.

2 stars instead of 1 because the guy who comp&apos;d our drinks handled the situation well.

The menu looked good: on one hand, it&apos;s a shame we didn&apos;t get to try it; on the other hand, if the Arnie and beer wasn&apos;t good, maybe we dodged a bullet.","Been here a few times if other restaurants nearby are too full. Food is ok, but the service usually sucks. Was at an all time low when I was there two nights ago with my family, seated at a table in full view of the at least 3 employees I saw working, and after 10mins of no one even acknowledging us, we left. It was weird? They weren&apos;t super busy, and the staff were mostly standing around talking to each other. Don&apos;t recommend.","So I decided to come here against all the bad reviews because it was a quiet evening and live nearby. My mom and I came Father&apos;s Day it was super quiet, our waiter was amazing! But it&apos;s true there were only like 2 people working there literally so I believe we got lucky because it was slow. The food was delicious, super reasonably priced and their drinks are amazing! I had a mango mojito it was yummy.",This place doesn&apos;t even try. Please look at the amount meat in this Cuban. This is like being robbed.,"Oh dear. My last visit here was nothing short of disastrous. I met a friend here before a comedy show in the area. We thought we&apos;d just grab some food and a couple drinks beforehand.

I was running late so my friend just went ahead and ordered nachos in the hopes they&apos;d pretty much be ready when I got there. When I did get in, it took a good ten minutes to even flag down someone to take my drink order. Then, it took another ten minutes to get my drink. Still no nachos. Fast forward another fifteen minutes or so, I&apos;m ready for another drink. I&apos;m more successful in flagging someone down, but it&apos;s another wait to actually get it. Finally, after about an HOUR of waiting for the nachos, they were served.

Okay, so these nachos were pretty dang good (and ginormous). They were heaped with yummy guacamole, sour cream, salsa, jalape√±os, cheddar jack cheese, and beans. This is where my two star rating comes in.

Even though I did really like the nachos, it was just not worth the unacceptable wait we had to endure to get them. The Lodge really needs to step up it&apos;s game to compete with the other bars in the area with far superior service.","We ordered takeout on Saturday night and had the poke appetizer, wildcat spicy chicken sandwich with onion rings and the fish sandwich with sweet potato fries. Everything was tasty but a bit pricier than I would have thought. Poke could have used a bit more tuna but both sandwiches hit the spot. Service was great and the bartender was very nice.","Another Lodge with poor service. I moved up to Shoreline from West Seattle. West Seattle lodge is notorious for poor service. This location is no exception, unfortunately. Went in one afternoon to see if it&apos;s better and sat at a table for almost 10 minutes without even being acknowledged. We just walked out and went across the street. Bummer!","I have been giving The Lodge a chance for the past couple of years, and have been perhaps 10 times in that period. That&apos;s a fair chance isn&apos;t it?  The only things that kept me coming back was a pretty good burger and a nice atmosphere in a neat old building, plus a good beer selection.  The reason I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be going back anymore is due to the staff, bartenders in particular (I like sitting at the bar).  More often than not they act like they don&apos;t enjoy people nor their work.  They always seem to have different staff and there&apos;s never been any semblance of a culture that values good customer service.  You can go to most anywhere in Greenwood and you&apos;ll be treated well, but they seem to struggle with this.  Until I hear that has changed, I won&apos;t be returning.  And I write this in hopes they&apos;ll notice this ongoing problem and work to fix it.","This spot is IT. Great drinks, tv screens everywhere, large food selection. But the best part is my man Max!!! Max always brings the energy, custom drinks, and good conversations. This man needs a raise for all he does, seriously. Can&apos;t wait to be back in next!","I&apos;ve been to a couple other Lodge locations and never been overly impressed, but had a great experience at this one recently on my first visit. I was very excited to find that they had a late night happy hour on the weekend starting at 10 pm. This included a 1$ off house wine. It was also not too loud and a place where I could have a conversation with a friend. I also really enjoyed the avocado toast (4$)  and the roasted brussels sprouts (5$). I&apos;ve been dreaming about going back to recreate this meal and hope it is as equally delicious at a location closer to my house. 

The lodge always has an impressive beer menu with lots of things that sound intriguing. I love the rotating screen that gives you details about all the options. The bartender was also nice enough to let me sample one I was not sure about. My friend is very picky about her mixed drinks and the bartender was able to create exactly what she was hoping for with both of her drinks. I was under the impression that Lodge locations would be closing, but I guess this is not the case and look forward to experiencing this on a more regular basis.","My husband and I love this restaurant! We&apos;ve been frequenting the last year after being new to the Greenwood area, and have gotten to know the servers/ bartenders pretty well.

Everyone is friendly and service is great. Lots of different options for food, and they&apos;ve been experimenting with different variations based on customer requests. Friendly environment to catch a game, especially if you&apos;re new in town. 

Recommend the nachos, burgers, and boom boom shrimp, but almost everything is worth trying. 

Nate is awesome! :) Super knowledgeable on the menu and creative with drinks if you&apos;re indecisive like me.","My daughter and I went into the bar Saturday night around 5:30. The place was almost empty. The service was beyond disappointing. At one point six servers were standing behind the bar taking . We had to ask for utensils, then ask for plates to eat out appetizers.  My BLTA was dry bread (had to ask for mayo) lettuce, a small slice of tomato, a dime size piece of avocado and bacon. Eventually we had to go to the bartender and ask for our check. The only bright spot was a server named Maxim.
We won&apos;t be back!","Most of these reviews say it all. Empty place with bad/slow service. The happy hour menu seems great at first but the quality of the food is horrible. 
The place was empty and three servers stood behind the bar chatting while we were clearly done eating and waiting for our check.","Food is great and outdoor area feels good with good airflow and outdoor heaters. In the time of covid, revel makes it feel a bit normal again. 
My favorite dishes are the bowls, but almost everything I order is delicious.","Wonderful outdoor dining experience on a warm evening.  Everyone was social distancing and wearing a mask. Tables were spread out enough to feel spacious. 

Enjoyed the drinks variety from Hite Korean beer to a fancy cocktail. Sauces were a hit with our kids. They even have a kids meal! 

The standouts were the short rib bowl with the incredible egg yolk and the chocolate mochi cake. 

We got a reservation and went at opening at 5:30. It did get busy and many diners were turned away so make a reservation!","We had a delicious dinner, seated inside with plenty of social distancing. Service was very attentive, drinks were good and the food was simple but amazOne of my favorite dining experiences!","I was excited to be back at this restaurant after a coupe years and the food was not good as I remembered. The Dungeness crab noodles were too salty (too much sauce for the small amount of noodles) and the baby back ribs weren&apos;t any special. It did not fall off the bones.

The restaurant was a little cold inside because  they kept the door open. If I knew, I would have worn more layers. That was not really an issue though. But they let a staff who was just covering his face with a bandana serve dishes. Bandanas are not masks...","Great fusion! The crab noodle &amp; the beef bowl is mouth watering good!

Our server was very nice and patient despite them closing up.",The pork belly rice bowl was really good and the service was friendly and attentive.  I think I just expected more from this place and it sort of fell flat. They did well with the spacing and covid guidelines.,"Revel deserves much better rating than it has! Going here I was expecting a 3 star restaurant and was pleasantly surprised!! Our waitress was amazing and encouraged we get the Dungeness crab noodles and the Korean pancake and both were really good!! The dungeness noodles are a must have, and I loved the trout, also a fun must try dish!
If you are looking for authentic, cheap Korean food this probably won&apos;t be what you are expecting but I&apos;m promise you will be pleasantly surprised! More of an Asian fusion restaurant with some classic dishes (kimchi, pancake) but also some very yummy dumplings, etc.

Seemed like a great place for drinks on the town, if you are looking for that!","Loved this place! It deserves better reviews! 

Let me premise this by saying that I am a connoisseur of Korean food. I lived in South Korea for two years and ate kimchi and rice every day. I love Korean food and eat it every chance I can get. 

Revel isn&apos;t the most authentic Korean food. It&apos;s not your hole-in-the-wall, Korean mom and pop shop. But that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not amazing. It&apos;s a lot more trendy, unique, and fun. Think of it like classic Korean food but with a gourmet, modern twist. I loved it! Really cool place. 

We ordered a few of the dishes that our waitress recommended and they were all outstanding. Some of our favorites were the Dungeness crab noodles and whole trout. The flavors were so complex and delicious, great sauces and cooked to perfection. We ordered some classics like the dumplings and the kimchi pancake too. And of course, we got some cabbage kimchi (the true test of a Korean restaurant). It was well done. 

The restaurant is modern and cool. It&apos;s located right on the Main Street in Ballard. Our service was great too. It was a little pricy but not too crazy for high quality food. 

Try this place out!!","The chicken skewers were flavorful. Their sauce was delicious. But it was overcooked- the texture was rough and dry on the inside, and rough and crunchy on the outside. Comes with only 3 skewers normally, but we asked for 4 to share.

The dumplings were burnt. Normally, dumplings are soft and juicy- the outside is tender and the inside is flavorful. Not the case with these dumplings. Comes with 5 dumplings, we asked for 6.

The service was decent- could have been slightly faster considering there weren&apos;t very many tables seated at the time, but our server was nice, efficient, and helpful. 

The interior is dim with low orange lighting. Intimate atmosphere. Average amount of tables. Small bar.","I was so excited when Revel &apos;came home&apos; so to speak. I have great memories of their old location and like most in the neighborhood, I was ecstatic to have them back. 

Things have changed and it shows. The service is still great but man, it&apos;s just not the same Revel. 

First off, it is really pricey for what it is. A salad, which basically consists of a small portion of mixed greens and a dressing costs $10? It&apos;s a side salad anywhere else. Also, no lamb salad! I repeat - THE LAMB SALAD IS NO MORE! What a sad day. People had mentioned this on social media but I had to see it to believe it. The staff had no recollection of the salad and wasn&apos;t sure as to why it is no longer offered. Shame, it was the best salad in the city and reason alone to come. 

The dumplings were good but they should tell you how many come in an order as five dumplins for $14 is steep. Also really salty, so there&apos;s that. 

The kimchi is good and I loved the fennel version. However, it&apos;s so crazy that &apos;modern&apos; korean places don&apos;t include small banchan with the meals. Kimchi should be a given, not something I have to pay $10 for (yeah, ten bucks). 

The crab noodles are fine. The al dente noodles are what you want but the flavor has changed and the magic is gone. The short rib is cooked perfectly but lacks seasoning and overall the bowl is pretty one note. 

I donno, for a salad, dumplings and two entrees and some drinks it comes out to being at least $50 a person to dine here. Sadly, I have to say this, Revel is no longer worth it. A victim of its own success or just forgetting where it came from, I am not sure. However its spiritual home has not revived a once stellar dining spot. 

To me, it just seems like another overpriced pan Asian restaurant which are available in spades in this city. I&apos;d much rather go to Paju or get the real deal down in Federal Way or Lakewood.","Our second visit to Revel and still enjoy the food and service. We ate on the patio and they were busy on a Saturday night so reservations are a must. We had the crab noodles, pork belly rice cake and the beef wonton app. All of these items were delicious. Also had the short rib rice bowl and I did not care for that. Meat was way to fatty, daikon was tasty but the dish was also 80% rice. I won&apos;t order their rice bowls again. They had an ube dulce de leche dessert which is amazing. Cocktails were tasty and overall very nice dinner.","I was really so excited to see the new building when I found out they had moved back to Fremont that I didn&apos;t eat all day. I had to save space cus I knew I was going to be eating the crab noodz and spending time with my best friend drinking here. The new places is huge, very modern and beautifully space. Still love the open kitchen concept they have going. Service was honestly amazing but I was really sad when the noodles came out because I waited so long to have them. The flavor wasn&apos;t as prominent as before. It wasn&apos;t strong in curry flavor. I was really sad hahaha. Luckily the katsu pork bao helped a bit and the drinks we ordered were delicious. Hopefully it was just an off day because I&apos;d hate to have to find a new noodle place hhaha.","I would say everything is fine but rather overpriced. Yes, it is in South Lake Union but it still seems a bit extravagant for Asian fusion compared to similar restaurants in the area. They also charge 20% mandatory gratuity: as someone who normally tips 18-20% regardless of service, this still felt a bit slimy. If you&apos;re going to make tipping &quot;mandatory&quot;, then just include it in your menu prices and pay your wait staff a living wage. If you think it will give customers sticker shock to do this (i.e., to be transparent about pricing), then reconsider your business model. This is not to speak poorly of the wait staff here--in my experience they are all friendly and helpful.

Dumplings and noodles are both decent: nothing to rave about but nothing specific to complain about either. I tried a few bites of someone else&apos;s rice bowl, and I think the best thing I ate was the beef in that dish. Overall I&apos;d say the best feature of this restaurant is its capacity for big groups. You should definitely make a reservation if you&apos;re going to come with a group at peak dinner hours, but they do handle large parties well","This place is in the heart of South Lake Union so it&apos;s no surprise it&apos;s kinda pricey. The food was good and I got the Kalbi streak bowl which was $19. If I worked at one of the giant tech companies I guess it makes sense to spend more than $20 for lunch, but I&apos;m not about that life. 

I wouldn&apos;t go by myself and it&apos;s pretty nice and everything, but if I was going for a nice sit down lunch this would be a great option. Lots of better grab and go choices around here though. 

The food was great and I really liked the mix of everything. The rice was cooked great which is honestly all I can ask for and I really liked their little spice tray deal. 

Anyway it&apos;s not a cheap option, but Seattle isn&apos;t cheap so this is still a place I would recommend!","We went there for the holiday lunch of our group. It was located close to South Lake Union and I liked their holiday decorations. We did not make an reservation and were seated along the table without waiting. Simple menu featuring Asian and Korean style foods. I had the rice bowl with tuna. Although it was not full when we were there, it took at least half an hour before our foods were ready. The rice bowl with tuna came with green veggies and kimchi. Liked the seasoning of the tuna as well as the veggies. But the rice was really disappointing being really hard to chew. I guess a little bit more water  when steaming the rice would be much better. And when we were ready to go, we found soda that we did not consume appeared on our check. We were lucky to have someone in our group who had sharp eyes.","This was a recommended lunch place by a coworker. Got the pork belly pancake and the dungeoness crab noodles for lunch a few weeks back. These are my notes. 

Crab noodle was nice. Could have used more of the white sauce

Pancake was okay. Nothing overly special

As for the accoutrements:
-Nice sweet Korean sauce
-miso paste was really salty
-the fish sauce was touted as being spicy. There were quite a few jalape√±os in there but it took a lot to get the intended intensity imho.","They had a new spring/summer menu! The portions were pretty good! The experience was good and the ambience was also classy! It was pretty busy for lunch on a mid weekday! They had enough dishes for a vegetarian/vegan person! I tried the sesame pancakes and the grilled tofu rice bowl! The flavors were very rich and delicious! I loved the ginger flavor powering the dishes! It was definitely fresh!
They add a default gratuity to the check irrespective of the size of the party and the service.","A bit hard to judge exactly, since it&apos;s COVID and they&apos;re offering a modified menu with outdoor seating and service only. We ordered the crab noodle bowl and it was pretty good, smallish portion size but good flavor. Mike really liked it. I&apos;d like to come back sometime and try this place for real (sit inside, non plastic utensils, etc.).","We came from out of town to spend some time in the big city.  We knew Anthony Bourdain ate at this restaurant and wanted to give it a whirl. It was really good! The crab noodles was amazing, the half chicken was amazing. Thanks guys.","Been going to Revel for 10 years and unfortunately they have really lost their spark. Not only is the food basically the same as 10 years ago but smaller portions and higher prices. The rice bowls don&apos;t come with a selection of sauces like they used to. The kimchi pancake is $10 and the size of a pita bread. If you go to standard Korean restaurant in Shoreline or Federal Way, the same $10 kimchi pancake would be loaded with seafood and bigger than your head. Service is always great but if the food isn&apos;t great then what&apos;s the point? They really need revamp the menu and consider lowering their prices or offering more at that price point. 

In addition they have a 4% service charge that doesn&apos;t go to the wait staff who you still have to tip on top of their service charge. I asked the waitress who handed me a pamphlet from Rachel Yang about the service charge and solicited feedback about he charge. I wrote her an email suggesting the surcharge felt misleading and all I received was a copy and paste of what was written on the pamphlet as a reply from Rachel Yang. 

Sorry but I think I&apos;m not going going to Revel anymore. Plenty of family run Korean restaurants that offer delicious food at reasonable price.","5 stars to the view, customer service, timeliness of food, and how well they uphold COVID standards.

The food? 3 stars on average (lower if the main entree is given more weight).

- Clam chowder? 4 stars. Has bacon, so salty is expected.
- Bread? 3 stars. Reminded me of stale bread or cooled dry toast, but let&apos;s be real here: the bar for free bread is set pretty low.
- Blacked salmon Caesar salad? 2 stars. Salmon was decent, salad was not (almost no flavor, and watery at best).

Will I go again? Yes, but I&apos;ll order something different.

Note: my waiter mentioned that the Salmon House is temporarily closed as of 9/28/2020. Not sure when they&apos;ll reopen, so be sure to call in advance if you&apos;re hoping to dine in or order out at this location.","Nothing much better than pulling up dockside and putting a take out order at Ivars on a sunny day.

Today&apos;s weather hit the 90s and luckily we found an open spot dockside to pull up and place an order. We grabbed a variety including the Cajun fish and chips which are a must if you prefer some spice.

You are able to place an order ahead which is recommended if the dockside is crowded. We wore masks to go out and place the order and we were able to take it to go and enjoy it on Lake Union.",Came here with my husband for a evening snack. Food was good. But they kept switching our orders. We tried the classic fish and chips but Cajun style. And also the salmon fish and chips. Nice staff. Only dining out or take out. They are following CDC guidelines.,"My hubby and I stopped there yesterday. It is one of my favorite Ivar&apos;s! It&apos;s not a dine in restaurant, you call out your order and someone will ring you up. Social distance isn&apos;t in effect here. The outside tables are put away to discourage gatherings. The place seems clean and the people are efficient and friendly. 

The food is always so good!  I had my usual clam chowder bowl and fish/chips Cajun seasoning. I was so full and satisfied my craving. 

I love this area!!","Salmon lovers rejoice! Ivar&apos;s is dedicated to all things salmon, the best fish - change my mind. They have a great patio right next to Lake Union with breathtaking views and a lovely atmosphere. The restaurant is huge and on the pricey side, but it was the perfect place to go to relax after a tiring day of hiking and driving! My sister had the entree that came with three different types of salmon and all of them were so good ( i obviously had to sneak a bite of each )","Now this was a real treat! The chowders pretty salty so it&apos;s a once in a while only kind of lunch but it was pretty neat. Due to all the new safety guidelines, you are served soup and the bread bowl separately in your to-go bag and make it at home as you wish. Loved the flexibility of this and totally did my own thing with the bread. I warmed some of it and ate it on the side and had the leftovers later. I was super impressed at the packaging of everything though!","I dropped by for happy hour. I was visiting Seattle and heard the Salmon Chowder was delicious. It did not disappoint ME. It was so flavorful and delicious. The Salmon pieces and potatoes made it so hearty and rich. It was yummy to my tummy. It was refreshing not to have to eat clam chowder. I want more salmon chowder. I also tried the mango wings. They were ok nothing special. Another appetizer I sampled was salmon kabobs. The sauce was heavenly, but the salmon wasn&apos;t seasoned enough. 

For my drink I had a blood orange martini. It was perfectly made. The bartender was great and was able to give me food information as a tourist. 
I left happy and full. The salmon chowder was definitely tasty and the highlight of my happy hour.","I came here about 5 years ago for prom, because of the waterfront view. At the time we were on a tight budget so we only had the fish and chips. Now that I have a little more income I was able to enjoy the main entrees. Starting off with the appetizers, we had fried calamari. It was very large enough to serve 6 people. I came here with 4 other people and there was a lot left over. I got the seafood linguine and the portion was giant. There was a mix of clams, muscles, scallops and various fish. Over green linguine pasta. My friends got the salmon, halibut and chowder. They said the salmon needed sauce, like a white garlic butter or soy sauce. Over all the servers are very nice and attentive. We were also able to sample some of the wine before ordering. Which I didn&apos;t know you could do. 

This place is kinda expensive. So I wouldn&apos;t come here without an occasion. Very nice for date nights, birthdays or anniversaries.","Ivar&apos;s is essentially a fast food fish and chips restaurant. Their fish is decent, fries are a little on the salty side, and clam chowder is DEFINITELY on the salty side.",Enjoyed a lovely meal for the first time with family and friend...the view was amazing. I definitely plan on returning to this restaurant the next time I come to Seattle.,"Came here for happy hour recently on a busy Saturday night and it was great. The hubs and I enjoyed our fish and chips, and also tried the salmon sliders which were surprisingly good. Our waiter (I think Seth was his name) was friendly and attentive, and we got our food in record time. Hats off to the staff and chefs! Also, the view of the city scape and water can&apos;t be beat!","KEEP CLAM at Ivar&apos;s.

Perfect lake views from the outdoor patio at Ivar&apos;s Salmon House. So much fun to sit outside on a sunny weekday for lunch and watch the seaplanes take off or the water taxis drop off patrons at the dock to eat here. 

The restaurant itself is also charming. As you enter the beautiful cedar replica of a Northwest Native American longhouse, you are surrounded by old photos, artwork, canoes suspended from the ceiling and historical photos. Beautiful totem poles grace the property, too. 

For lunch, try the wild Alaskan smoked salmon chowder. Such a delicious bite. They are also famous for the Keep Clam, Clam chowder which we did not try. 

The alder grilled wild salmon sandwich was delicious. Served with a side of waffle sweet potato fries on a brioche bun with a pesto-basil aioli, this was a great choice for lunch. Surprisingly, the Alaskan cod fish and chips were just okay. 

Plenty of free parking made this an easy last stop before our flight back home. It would also be a great place to come at sunset.","Our date night was near perfection!
My wife, Jana, and I enjoyed lakeside dining inside of one of Seattle&apos;s most unique restaurant interiors. Originally built in 1971, Ivar&apos;s has respectfully managed northwest native culture masterfully.

I love the menu at Ivar&apos;s Salmon House. It is straight to the point, it focuses on salmon and a couple of other dishes ensuring quality at every turn.  I enjoyed the halibut from the fresh page of the menu, it was smoked perfectly, maintaining moisture throughout. My wife had the medley, her meal too was wonderful. The $37 priced meals were generous.

One minor beef.......really, $4 for a basket of bread? I just dropped $200 for a meal for two (drinks, apps, dinner, dessert) and you want to charge me for a measly basket of bread?

Everything is 5 stars but the bread.","Wow, oh wow! Lunch here was an absolute treat.

Picture this--a sunshiny, spring day in Seattle, sitting on a patio that looks out over Lake Union, drinking an Arnold Palmer and eating king salmon caught from the Copper River just a week ago. 

I told my aunt I was going to be in Seattle for a few days and asked if she wanted to go to lunch. Right away she asked me if I liked salmon and said she knew a great place. She wasn&apos;t wrong. Everything from the ambiance to the kind service and delicious food was a hit in my opinion.

I don&apos;t know the exact name of the dish I ordered, because my aunt took the liberty to order for me--she said she knew what I wanted lol. Again, she wasn&apos;t wrong. The dish came with a filet of king salmon over a bed of mashed potatoes with asparagus, crispy onions, and a red wine reduction sauce of some sort. Absolutely wonderful. The only reason for four stars instead of five was that once I got to the bottom layer of salmon it was pretty close to raw. The majority of it (like 75% was fully cooke and perfect) but there was a big chunk on the bottom that was a little too rare, in my opinion. By the time I got to this, I thought it would be silly to send it back to get cooked more, so I just gave it to my aunt to take home and heat up later.

Service was friendly, food came out in a decent amount of time, the view is beautiful, and the food was very good! A bit spendy (I think my dish was $40), but if you&apos;re in the mood for fresh caught salmon, it is SO worth it.","This place is AMAZING we stumbled upon this place and decided to try it out! 

The food: fresh and delicious! Need I say more? But seriously! I haven&apos;t had such good seafood in a LONG time as it can be hard to find. We started the meal with a Caesar and mixed green salad (both $7.50) as well as the mussels ($15). The salads were yummy (not much to say about salad) and the mussels were fantastic. The sauce they were in is great! Super fresh and delicious! For our main we got the northwest fish plates ($37), the coho salmon ($36) and the halibut ($38). All of the dishes were fantastic! I got the northwest fish plate and it was great - it came with potatoes, broccolini, scallops, salmon, and halibut. It was the perfect dish to try several items. The salmon and halibut entrees were great too! The salmon had more of a Mexican and Asian flair as it was served with a ginger and mango salsa. The halibut was topped with a DELICIOUS fig salsa! 

We devoured our food! I totally recommend this place!! The food was fresh and really good! 

The atmosphere: we chose to sit outside which was AWESOME! we got to see boats passing by in all shapes and sizes as well as the draw bridge opening and closing. They have a nice indoor seating selection as well as a &quot;Togo/takeout&quot; section.

Our waiter was fantastic and gave us great recommendations! 

Would I come back? Most definitely!!","Wow! I&apos;ve been living in the area for 3 yrs and passed by this place a few times but never realized it was here! My friend invited us out to dinner here and I was shocked and amazed! The outside is hidden, plain and unassuming but once you walk through the doors. The interior is beautiful full of Native American wood carvings (not sure if they&apos;re real or reproductions), photos of Native Peoples from the Pacific Northwest and the VIEW!!! They have situated the building in such a way that it maximizes the view of the water, which makes for  a beautiful dining experience. 
Our server was decent and the food was delicious. I had the classic pan fried oysters and a side salad. The overall experience was worth the price of the meal.","So I&apos;m being considerate here 
Food was ok , in our party of five there were numerous menu sampling and here&apos;s the quick and dirty 
Clam chowder tasted and looked like onion dip in consistency and whether there were clams there at all 
Coconut shrimp looked like the fry chef went out for a cigarette break as it was almost dark brown and a little dry
The combo fish and chips combo had one of two piece of cod under cooked 
Good side 
Blackened salmon salad was good as was the salmon sandwich 

Now the service : server was terrible in attitude seems like he did not want to be there 
When you serve appetizer to several people you should offer small plates for sharing . When it was not offered we asked for some and by the time the plates arrived so was our entrees ( about 10 mins later ) 
The rest of the meal was an attitude Of someone that may have been asked to work for a living 
Oh well good luck to them","I think we will stick to the walk up window. Ate in the main restaurant this week for the first time. Very nice staff and they were patient taking family photos. I got the halibut and my husband a trio of fish plate and halibut was one of the fish. Both were over cooked which made them dry. His salmon was also over cooked. They weren&apos;t ruined but for $37 it should be prepared properly. My husband cooks halibut at home all the time and doesn&apos;t over cook except when it was frozen before and not fully thawed. This is fresh halibut so no excuses. 

Since we were with out of town guests we didn&apos;t say anything. 

We have gotten fish and chips and a salmon dinner at the walk up window and it&apos;s always been great at a much reduced price. 5 stars for the walk up window.","Our first sit down restaurant with a waiter since the start of COVID! Exciting stuff. I ordered the blackened salmon Caesar and he got a platter with a few different things, plus the chowder (which was the best dish). I also had wine and there were bread rolls (soft and yummy). Everything was pretty tasty, though the main courses were nothing spectacular. Four stars due to the ambiance and the big windows right on the water.","Always go for happy hour! I haven&apos;t visited this place in many years but after going a few months ago, I think I&apos;ve gone here at least twice a month since! And I always order their calamari! It&apos;s to die for! And the cornbread and their special butter is a definite can&apos;t miss! I should try other items off the menu but I can&apos;t skip on the calamari and I can only eat so much! The view is icing on the cake and the staff are friendly!

Now, can you guys bring back the Sunday Brunch?","This place is EVERYTHING!! It may not look like it from the outside, but this is the best sandwich shop in town. I went on a Sunday afternoon when it wasn&apos;t too crowded, so I took my sweet time picking out what I wanted to order. The man at the front helped me with the menu and was super welcoming. 

I ended up getting the Crown and the Chicken Pesto sandwich (to save for later). Both were out of this world. I know these sound basic, but let me tell you what...these are not basic sandwiches. The combination of meat and toppings is incredible. I always hate when I get a sandwich and the bread scrapes the roof of my mouth. This bread is delicious and doesn&apos;t hurt your mouth! It is soft while also having a bit of a crunch. Absolutely amazing.

Will be back a million more times to satisfy my many sandwich cravings!","Don&apos;t let the no-frills look of this place fool you. These are the some of the best sandwiches you can get in Seattle. Hippies rejoice: it&apos;s not only located behind the huge statue of Lenin, but it&apos;s super vegan/vegetarian friendly too.

My favorites are the Pesto Veggie grilled sandwich and the Field Roast Italian Veggie Sausage. They are scrumptious, the portions are good, and the prices are so reasonable.

The people who work here are the nicest, too!  They let me bring my dog in while I&apos;m waiting for a sandwich. Good vibes all around.","This is a fantastic sandwich shop.  Great staff and conveniently located near the Fremont Troll and Lenin Statue.  Lots of breweries not too far away either, but they surprisingly had a nice can selection inside!  There is some seating inside, but there is a lot of seating outside too.

With so many options, I settled on a classic.  The Italian grinder.","A great sandwich spot tucked in behind the Statue of Lenin. I ordered a custom vegetarian &quot;Build Your Own&quot; sandwich consisting of gluten-free multi-grain bread, seasoned tofu, Swiss cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, jalape√±os, basil, chipotle mayo sauce, and Grinders sauce. The sandwich tasted so good! I&apos;m not vegetarian nor am I gluten intolerant but sometimes I get in the mood for a meatless meal, and Royal Grinders sure hit the spot for me. 

The seasoned tofu is tasty, and this place uses the best gluten-free bread I have tried, which is something you can&apos;t say about other variations of the kind. My partner ordered a chicken pesto sandwich and asked me to take a bite from his sandwich, and it tasted great too. 

The wait for all sandwich orders take about ten minutes, but it&apos;s worth it if you want a well-made, hot, delicious sandwich.","The sandwiches pack a punch of flavor and are affordable and worth the price. Parking can be a little difficult and the sandwiches takes time to make, so don&apos;t be in a rush. Had the Italian and it was meaty, salty, warm and everything I wanted.

5% cash discount on everything.","One of the best sandwiches I&apos;ve ever had! Agree with everyone, Italian and Chicken Pesto are delicious! What makes it amazing though is that bread, so crunchy but still soft, full of garlic herb flavor, and the bite is just nothing like I&apos;ve ever had. Both are a must try!","The bun was excellent - toasted to perfection and nicely flavored with some (Italian ?) herbs. The meat was pretty good - not like at a really high-end deli but good; certainly better than some.

The veggies on the sandwich were fresh and tasty. 

Very traditional grinder - lots of options.",A grinder fit for a king. These grinders are delicious with an olive oil herb infused bread and you can taste it. Lots of meat do you aren&apos;t going to go hungry. A half a sandwich and chips was more than enough for me but of course my boys are a whole one. We all really enjoyed our lunch. The have some tables and umbrellas outside so you can enjoy your meal if the weather is good. The interior is very small but there is a tiny bar you could eat at but only about 3 people will fit.,"The sandwiches here take a little bit of time to make so beware and there are only few stools to sit inside. I suggest eating on the terrace outside but be on the look out for bees! 
We got the Italian grinder it was $11 no drink or chips, sandwich only. The bread is very flavorful and did not get soggy. It goes well with the generous amount of meats inside that were not too salty unlike some over places. The veggies included only really red onions and tomatoes but you can customize that to how you like. Overall you get very full off this sandwich and so the price makes sense.","Ordered Uber Eats from here, as you can see from my Picture my &quot;Grilled&quot; Meat and Cheese wasn&apos;t Grilled at all. Meat had  good taste and it was a decent sized portion but that is not a grilled sandwich. It felt like it was microwaved and then thrown on a panini press for  like 2 Seconds. I won&apos;t be ordering again, too many better options for my money! It&apos;s sad because I feel like it could be really good but this is my second  attempt to eat there and neither trip left me impressed. 2 Stars simply because it was a decent sized sandwich and the meat was pretty good.","My manager recommended this to me last Friday - I was craving a good sandwich and she said I had to this place! I was not disappointed at all! I got the Chicken Pesto Grinder. The sandwiches are freshly made, with various ingredients (lots of vegetarian options too!) AND they&apos;re for a good price! I took one star off because though I loved my sandwich, I found that it was missing some flavor (maybe I didn&apos;t get enough dressing in mine?), and the wait was also 20 min. But I am definitely returning and will recommend to my friends :)",I ordered the Italian Grinder and it was absolutely delicious except that it was SO salty!!!! I had to drink like 8 cups of water after eating that sandwich. I&apos;ll probably order the Royal Grinder next time. I would highly recommend to go ordering since they barely have any seating inside unless it&apos;s a sunny day (they have seating outside).,"We decided to try this place for lunch, based on the high reviews.  We ordered 1 grinder and 1 panini...I don&apos;t remember the names, but they both had salami in them.  We both had stomach aches after for the rest of the day. Not fun.  Won&apos;t be back.","I am surprised I have never had sandwiches from this spot and feel like I have been missing out. I did some Caviar deliveries for this spot and figured I&apos;d give it a try since everyone else was and I have some major FOMO.

Their Italian grinder was amazing and definitely something I&apos;ll be getting again. I also got the chicken pesto but maybe I eat way too much chicken as a part of my routine diet to truly think this stood out. The combination of meats and peppers and olives really make the Italian grinder a mouth watering contest. I got both sandwiches and tried half of each and was super full...saved the rest for dinner and still just as good.

The bread is warm, not hard, or burned. Sandwiches are one of my favorite things about Seattle and this confirmed it for me once again.","Place is solid.  Whenever I am downtown and need a good sub, I go here.  Staff is very friendly, professional, recommends and fast.  They are just very down to earth and always giving off positive energy.  I always get the chicken pesto sandwich with a side of the combination sauce.  The quality is consistent.  The vibe is consistent.  The shop looks like a &quot;hole in the wall&quot; but don&apos;t let that fool you into thinking this place is not good.  They still have an excellent food rating.  Giving them 5 because there are other sandwich places that I could try, but I don&apos;t want to because this place has consistent high quality all around.",The royal grinder is hauntingly good. Perfect balance of salty goodness. Hard to make a sandwich that really stands out among great sandwiches but they did it.,"Truly royal. Best (and cheapest!) meal I had on my trip to Seattle. Vegan options totally kick butt here!

Would definitely go here all the time if I lived in the neighborhood.","I may fight you to the death if you say there is a better sandwich in Seattle. This little spot in Fremont knows how to do it right. Bread was nice and toasty, chicken was moist, and pesto sauce gave me a warm fuzzy feelin on the inside. Tried to replicate it at home but I&apos;ll probably just leave it to the Pros here for next time.","I have been going to this place for years and they are hands down the best sandwich in Seattle.  

I was originally drawn to this place by the intoxicating aroma that came from the shop.  Turns out, their food is even better than it smells!

I loved the teriyaki chicken grinder but hadn&apos;t been back in a while since going vegan a few years back.  Figured I would go back and see if they could possibly make something vegan and it turns out, they had TWO regular vegan options!  I told the owner how excited I was to learn they had added vegan options to the menu.  He laughed and responded by saying, &quot;Yeah, figured it was time to grow up and learn how to eat my vegetables.&quot;","I&apos;m a good person. But my biggest fault is impatience. After a few minutes, I begin to resemble the cartoon character with steam coming out of their ears and red cheeks.

That being said, if food is good, I don&apos;t mind waiting. And Royal Grinders? Well, it&apos;s so good I lose track of time, lost in the revelry that their sandwiches bring. Am I pouring it on a little thick? Too bad, it&apos;s deserved.

Royal Grinders is one of the best sandwiches I&apos;ve ever eaten. And I been a few places.
I recently ate the &quot;Field Roast Smoked Tomato &amp; Tempeh Bacon w/ guacamole, Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Carrots, Cucumbers, and Red Sauce.&quot; They do us, vegetarians, right, no skimping on the flavor.
Just typing that a little drool came out of my mouth.

My boo consumed the &quot;chicken pesto grinder&quot; a sandwich that made him speechless, speechless I tell you!
So yes, the wait is a little long, the storefront is tiny and the line can be offputting. But get over it, your mouth and belly will thank you.

p.s. A+ customer service!"
