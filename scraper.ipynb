You always need bites with your beer; and when she found out that Off the Rez was here, she was excited to try their fry bread.  I had never eaten fry bread before, but was down to try something new. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the Powwow Burger, a bacon cheeseburger with fry bread for buns, while I had two Indian tacos, one with pork and the other with chicken.  Menu was pretty standard with taco and burger combinations, with sides like kale salad and fries. \\n\\nMy Indian tacos were A-OK.  Don&apos;t get me wrong - the fry bread was awesome!  It was soft and fluffy and had crispy edges.  I would&apos;ve happily just eaten it by itself.  But getting it as a taco, to sandwich the meat and toppings seemed to distract from the real winner of Off The Rez, the fry bread.  Both of my meats, chicken and pork were bland.  You&apos;d think that with the toppings it wouldn&apos;t be so, but they were.  My chicken taco included shredded cheese and slaw in a crema sauce while the pork one had a BBQ sauce with slaw and was supposed to have jalapenos, but sadly, they must&apos;ve forgot to put it on.  The sauces did help to add some flavor to the tacos, but meat just never came through.  My friend felt the same way about her Powwow Burger, saying that the beef patty tasted like it wasn&apos;t seasoned.  \\n\\nI advise getting a sweet fry bread item instead of a savory dish, in hopes that it fares much better.  The fry bread was really good, so the simpler the toppings, the better.',\n",

Unfortunately for me, I started with the carnitas, and the flavor just blows everything else out of the water.

       " 'I love this place and love the consistency of quality each time! Both food truck and museum locations have been satisfactory. It is packaged well and the customer service is great!',\n",
       " 'This review is for the brick and mortar location, not the truck. Off the Rez is so delicious and their fry bread is made fresh, with high-quality ingredients, at extremely reasonable prices.  I have nothing bad to say about anything we ate at this restaurant and wish it was open later or had another location so we could here more often!\\n\\nThe chili taco is the play here - I went with the classic beef but have heard good things about the others ones as well.  There was a generous amount of chili on the bread and it was flavorful and spiced well but wasn&apos;t spicy hot.  We also got the seasonal cranberry fry bread which was so good our group of 6 ended up getting 3 to share (we initially all naively thought we could just share bites of 1 - wrong).  \\n\\nThe sides here are good as well if you&apos;re trying to get some veggies in alongside the deep-fried goodness - the Kale salad was fresh and the dressing was pretty tasty and the coleslaw was solid, though not as memorable as the other things we ate.\\n\\nAlso be sure to check out the various beverage options they&apos;ve got up by the register - we were happy to see a variety of both beers and non-alcoholic beverages.',\n",
       " 'The only thing better that my top 5 food truck experiences is to have a sit down option too. Today we checked out the new location inside of the Burke Museum after attending a great play at the UW School of Drama (plug for them too!). Even though they are open until 5 on Sundays (same hours as the museum, although they have their own separate entrance) they seemed eager to close early when we arrived as the only customers at 4:35. No matter, they were friendly, took our order and in no time we were enjoying two savory fry bread tacos along with one sweet one to share. The chili verde chicken and pulled pork selections were both great, as was the honey soaked dessert. Prices were very reasonable for what amounts to a museum cafe. I can&apos;t wait to come back and try other items.',\n",
       " 'One of my favorite trucks in Seattle:\\n\\nQuality: the veggie tacos are good. The fry bread is fresh and the chili is well seasoned. I would like more veggies on the veggie tacos, but they are delicious nevertheless.\\n\\nQuantity: the fry bread is thick and the put enough chilli on it to make it filling. I usually buy 3, but 2 is still plenty.\\n\\nService: classic food truck service, nothing to rave or complain about\\n\\nPrice: $5 per taco is steep, so I get it once per month only. They are pretty pricey, so be prepared to splurge.',\n",
       " 'I&apos;m glad Off The Rez specializes in fry bread because damn, it was good and there really aren&apos;t many places that do it.  But the savory dishes seemed to be amiss. \\n\\nMy friend and I spotted this food truck, as it was the truck that was parked outside of Optimism Brewery when we visited.  You always need bites with your beer; and when she found out that Off the Rez was here, she was excited to try their fry bread.  I had never eaten fry bread before, but was down to try something new. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the Powwow Burger, a bacon cheeseburger with fry bread for buns, while I had two Indian tacos, one with pork and the other with chicken.  Menu was pretty standard with taco and burger combinations, with sides like kale salad and fries. \\n\\nMy Indian tacos were A-OK.  Don&apos;t get me wrong - the fry bread was awesome!  It was soft and fluffy and had crispy edges.  I would&apos;ve happily just eaten it by itself.  But getting it as a taco, to sandwich the meat and toppings seemed to distract from the real winner of Off The Rez, the fry bread.  Both of my meats, chicken and pork were bland.  You&apos;d think that with the toppings it wouldn&apos;t be so, but they were.  My chicken taco included shredded cheese and slaw in a crema sauce while the pork one had a BBQ sauce with slaw and was supposed to have jalapenos, but sadly, they must&apos;ve forgot to put it on.  The sauces did help to add some flavor to the tacos, but meat just never came through.  My friend felt the same way about her Powwow Burger, saying that the beef patty tasted like it wasn&apos;t seasoned.  \\n\\nI advise getting a sweet fry bread item instead of a savory dish, in hopes that it fares much better.  The fry bread was really good, so the simpler the toppings, the better.',\n",
       " 'Food was great here and service was also nice! Their Fry-bread is crispy on the outside and soft inside. Their tacos were flavorful and i highly recommend the bison tacos. My girlfriend had the rice bowl and that was also delicious. I would definitely come back here again.',\n",
       " 'YUM! I got the carnitas, and that is some of the best meat I&apos;ve had in a long time. The slaw on top was fresh, crunchy, and matched the meats well. The chicken that my partner got was less than spectacular... but still good. I think if I started with the chicken, it would have been a lot better. Unfortunately for me, I started with the carnitas, and the flavor just blows everything else out of the water. My partner also got a lemon curd dessert fry bread and he enjoyed it. \\n\\nI want to try their burgers next! Thanks for making delicious food! It&apos;s awesome to sneak a little taste of your delicious world!',\n",
       " 'The chili is delicious. It&apos;s a bit more tomato-y than tex mex chili and has such a strong flavor profile, very well seasoned. Their fries are golden. My family adored their sweet fry bread. They have a range  from burgers to kale and quinoa salads. They also offer &quot;Indian tacos&quot; made with frybread. Check &apos;em out',\n",
       " 'The food in this cafe is remarkably delicious compared to most place you find inside of art instillations.  Usually food inside of museums etc. is overpriced and processed. I ordered the beef chili Indian taco. It was hand-crafted and well-conceived. Plus the orders came up quickly!  I rarely get over to the he UW. Campus, but now I have another reason to go.',\n",
       " 'I had the Spicy Chicken Frybread Grilled Cheese at the Grilled Cheese Grand Prix. It was very good! Such a good combination of flavors.',\n",
       " 'This place absolutely blew me . My only disappointment was not being able to eat even more beyond my stomach capacity! 10/10 on everything we are.',\n",
       " 'Good food, good service, just needs more bison sauce on the wild rice. Fry bread is super comfort food. Got half strawberry jam and nutella. Tacos were tasty too. They should open another location with a more expansive menu and execute similar to Tocabe.',\n",
       " 'They usually sell tacos in different spots over Seattle. It&apos;s inconvenient for me to go around but luckily, they have fixed located right Burke museum in UW campus !!! Their tacos is superior. No errors in their tacos . Cooked to perfection!!',\n",
       " 'Ordered for a company&apos;s party and it was delicious! We got savory and sweet version. We got cinnamon sugar, honey, and berries jam. \\nSavory we got chicken, beef, and vegetarian (beans and corn).\\nThe pickled onions were quite good as well. \\nWould recommend as a big party tray event.',\n",
       " 'I&apos;ve been a fan of Off the Rez and their delicious frybread tacos for years now. I really don&apos;t like the chicken one at all, and the beef one is okay, but the pulled pork taco is where it&apos;s at. I don&apos;t usually like barbecue sauce, but their combination of sauce and toppings is sublime.\\n\\nI always felt like there was too high of a filling to bread ratio (what a problem to have, right?), but the last time I was there, they actually fixed it. It seemed like the piece of frybread was a lot bigger, and now it&apos;s absolutely perfect.\\n\\nIf you haven&apos;t tried their tacos yet, you need to - just make sure you get the pork.']"
