       "['Note that El Camion IS OPEN during COVID for TAKEOUT, DELIVERY, &amp; DINE OUTSIDE!\\n\\nWow wow wow idk why I never came here in college, but El Camion is definitely my new favorite spot for Mexican food in U-District!\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I came here yesterday for dinner and were pleased by the quality of food and quality of service here. They&apos;re menu is expansive and includes everything from tacos to mole to burritos to camarones a la diabla (spicy shrimp). I ordered a chicken burrito ($9.42) and my boyfriend ordered chicken enchiladas ($12.75) to go. \\n\\nThe chicken burrito weighed at least a pound and was stuffed with moist chicken, cheese, cilantro, rice, black beans, sour cream, and tomatoes. I poured some salsa verde and salsa rojo on top, and it was BOMB. Every bite was just bursting with flavor! I was a happy camper with lots of yummy leftovers for breakfast the next day. Next time, I hope to order the same burrito smothered in verde sauce (+$1.50). My boyfriend also enjoyed his chicken enchiladas with molé sauce and was very full and satisfied after dinner.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is pleasant, considering that it&apos;s a food truck right off the main interstate street. They have string lights above and five outdoor tables spaces out, three of which are under a tarp if you&apos;re interested in sitting outside.\\n\\nService was good. We only had to wait 15-20 minutes after ordering and the lady handing out orders gave us extra sauce after asking. \\n\\nAll employees were wearing masks (over their mouths and noses!) and there is a big bottle of hand sanitizer right by the register. People were also good at social distancing, and it&apos;s much easier to spread out since it&apos;s outdoors.\\n\\nOverall: 5/5 for food, 5/5 for service, 5/5 for health and safety measures',\n",
       " 'I have heard legend of the burritos and other food here, but have had less opportunity to venture out since the onset of COVID. Thankfully, El Camion is available on DoorDash to help make things feel a little more normal. I had the steak quesadilla and trust and believe this was the fattest quesadilla I ever did see and it was incredible. Even a clean plate club like me couldn&apos;t finish this; it reheated pretty well the next day but I&apos;d recommend splitting something.',\n",
       " 'I love this location of El Camion!! They are consistently amazing. I have tried a number of things on the menu bust mostly tacos. Their chicken tacos and shrimp tacos are by far my favorite. The shrimp tacos come with fresh avocado that is always perfectly ripe. Their salsas are also super tasty. They can be a bit slow, but I don&apos;t mind as they are usually busy and it&apos;s only a few people working because it&apos;s a food truck.\\n\\nThe best thing about this location for me is the employees. My husband is usually the one who goes and picks it up, sometimes I will go. ONE time we brought our daughter with us and they gave her a free strawberry pastry that she loved. Now every time my husband has been back (months from them meeting our daughter) they ALWAYS ask about her. How kind! With the amount of people that eat at this location, I am so impressed and touched that they remember our kiddo. If the business survives the pandemic, they have a fan for life!!',\n",
       " 'Love love love their tamales!! Most bang for your buck food truck! \\n\\nHighly recommend their tamales - cheap, delicious and wholesome! They have a variety so I would go with any and you&apos;d be good. I think it&apos;s good for people who are on a budget and don&apos;t really feel like cooking during a week where you have so much work to do. \\n\\nI&apos;m sure their other dishes are just as amazing because I&apos;ve seen people line up near the Northeast Seattle food truck location during lunch and it gets busy. I&apos;ve also tried the one in Ballard but that location appears to be closed which is too bad because that&apos;s where the variety of tamales are based.',\n",
       " 'El Camion is probably the best Mexican food in Seattle proper, although that may be the equivalent to being the smartest idiot. That being said, the food here is real good and these people are not dumb. That was just an analogy. \\n\\n\\nIf you are looking to pay $16 plus a tip for some mediocre Mexican food like a lot of places in Seattle, you should go somewhere else. They serve up food of the people, you&apos;re able to get a filling, delicious meal for less than $11 and fast.\\n\\nThey offer an excellent variety of different Mexican food but you can never go wrong with the burritos here. I went in this evening and got a hearty carne asada burrito weighing in at over a pound and a half. \\n\\nI&apos;ve lived in Seattle a few years now and El Camion has always been a reliable staple of mine. Very good!',\n",
       " 'This place is a great bang for your buck. Lots a good food for a decent price! Be aware that the wait might be a little long depending on what time you go. If you are in lunch hours I&apos;d recommend ordering online. I get the Plato Mexicano. Its flavorful and juicy. They also have an assortment of sauces you can request. With the Carne Asada, the lady recommended the Avocado or Chipotle. Went along perfectly. Great for if you&apos;re feeling hungry and want a warm meal.',\n",
       " 'I have never had one of their burritos without having a slight stomach ache afterwards. Not because there&apos;s anything wrong with the burritos I just eat twice what I reasonably should here. Their burritos are rich, delicious, just sloppy enough, and enormous. I hit this place up at least like once every two months. Very crave-able, very satisfying, and I would 100% recommend.',\n",
       " 'El camion is Spanish for &apos;the truck&apos;. As in food truck. Located in the university area this is one of several locations and it has a permanent spot plus parking and  covered tables. \\n\\nFood: we tried the veggie burrito, pork enchiladas,fish tacos and shrimp quesadilla. Everything was completely awesome and flavorful. \\n\\nService: Friendly and efficient. Doesn&apos;t get any better than this. \\n\\nWe are going back.',\n",
       " 'I didn&apos;t expect to find mexican food this good in Seattle. We had burritos and they were fantastic, we were already thinking about when we could come back as we were pulling out of the parking lot. I tried the adobado, per the dude working there&apos;s request, and it was super flavorful and delicious. I also tried a couple of bites of the asada burrito and the asada was amazing! The chipotle salsa was to die for, I wish they bottled it. The guy taking our order was also super nice. I&apos;ll be back very soon!',\n",
       " 'Good tacos and location. This food truck is open often and is easy to get to. There&apos;s a big parking lot and it&apos;s right off sand point. There&apos;s some picnic benches for outdoor eating. The staff are friendly and fairly fast.\\nI&apos;ve gotten tacos and burritos here and enjoyed both. They have good flavor and a nice salsa to go with it. \\n\\nIt would be nice if the staff put their masks over their nose and not just their mouth.',\n",
       " 'Amazing!!! clean facility and fresh food you won&apos;t believe it came from a truck!!! The people were super friendly and took the time to explain things to me and answer all my questions the location was easy to find the parking was great there are times they are super busy as long as you don&apos;t go in a hurry but they do their best to get you in and out in a timely manner I will definitely be going back to this place several times over and over you can never get too much good Mexican food.',\n",
       " 'El Camion has been a favorite or ours for well over a decade. When the Sand Point truck arrived we were thrilled and have eaten there plenty of times. Last night was the first time things were totally off. Picked up our online order around 6:30 and the carne asada was super dry, some burnt. The preparation appeared rushed and things looked sloppy. Flavors weren&apos;t as savory and authentic.  Not sure what went wrong but it was saddening. Hope things return to normal soon.',\n",
       " 'I had to increase the overall rating here because while I wasn&apos;t thrilled about what I ordered, my friend who is a very hard to please carne asada person loved their carne asada burrito, saying it was the best in the PNW!',\n",
       " 'I really want to like this place, however I&apos;ve been here twice and both times my order was incorrect. Disappointing.',\n",
       " 'These MF tacos S-L-A-P!!!\\n\\nThe chicken tacos, the steak joints, the shrimp ones and shoooot even the pork ones are all delectable. \\n\\nThe quesadillas make my mouth water and they have a plethora of different sauces, I recommend trying every singe one. \\n\\nI&apos;ve never had a bad experience, they always give me an overwhelming amount of meat and rice and of course I love that. AND it&apos;s affordable. \\n\\nThe fact that they support Black Lives Matter is just another overall plus. Support this business they&apos;re tasty. \\n\\n***Pro-tip: If you&apos;re a tad bit impatient call in 10-15 min before you arrive and it&apos;ll be done upon arrival',\n",
       " 'First time visiting this El Camion taco truck. It was pretty darn good. \\nAlso first time getting their burritos. Normally just go with the &quot;street tacos&quot;. But may now be a convert to burritos. Especially when they weigh over 2lbs each. And yes I weighed them at home on my food scale. \\n\\nHubby had the fish burrito. He loves the El Chupacabra version and wanted to compare. I think he prefers El Chupacabra but that&apos;s based on dine in and not to go. I guess we will have to get takeout from El Chupacabra soon. (Oh rats) I had the carne asada burrito and while it was good I wish I would have got chicken instead. \\n\\n When hubby arrived for pickup there were at least 5 people in line in front of him including one person ordering for at least 8 people. . Hubby was smart &amp; went &amp; sat in his truck til he saw that large order filled. \\n\\nGreat staff went on an ingredient run to the nearest grocery store to keep supplies in stock to meet order demand. \\n\\nWill return again!',\n",
       " 'Forget your lunch plans because you have new ones!  \\nEl Camión is the best authentic Mexican food I&apos;ve had in Seattle, period.  I used to live in Oaxaca and worked in Mexico City so though I am blonde, I consider myself to be an excellent judge and tough critic when it comes to Mexican food.\\nI was hungry after tennis so I ordered a lot, little did I know the servings were so big, yeah :)  We ended up having Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos for lunch with four different kinds of salsa.  \\nFor dinner we had the special of the day, Chile Rellenos with black beans and rice. DIOS MÍO, que rico!  \\nMy boyfriend and I are officially full now smiling on the couch.  \\nGracias a Él Camion, Bien Hecho y Buen Provencho!',\n",
       " 'Closest spot to the Mexican food I miss in SoCal, these guys are great. Gorditas are great and the tripas is really good (some places do them terribly)',\n",
       " 'Everytime I come to this truck my order gets messed up in a different way. I asked for a burrito with asada and no rice. I ended up with dry shredded beef that tastes like it&apos;s been in a crock pot for two days it&apos;s so dry.\\nAnd full Of rice. So I got nothing but a tortilla filled with rice a couple couple shreds of horribly dry beef. And the second burrito I got was also supposed to be asada and they gave me pork!!!\\nThis is the last time I got to el camion!!!!',\n",
       " 'It&apos;s an okay spot for tacos. Good bonus points because it&apos;s a decent spot to pick up food if you&apos;re hungry and going to the Burke-Gilman brewing next door (you can bring food inside). \\n\\nWe picked up tacos. Overall tacos were decent but they were average. Adobada - spicy grilled pork was decent. Juicy but a little salty.  Chorizo - I didn&apos;t like it. A little too moist kind of like a sloppy joe more than the dryer spiced chorizo. Not my favorite. Carne - probably the best of the tacos I had. Good! Shrimp - decent but the shrimp itself lacked flavors to make it special. \\n\\nService was great and friendly. \\n\\nIf you&apos;re hungry and need an option, it&apos;s a good place. I heard their burritos are way better so will have try their burritos next time. But it didn&apos;t knock it out of the park for me. It simply fed me and I was satisfied.',\n",

I ordered a chicken burrito ($9.42) and my boyfriend ordered chicken enchiladas ($12.75) to go. \\n\\nThe chicken burrito weighed at least a pound and was stuffed with moist chicken, cheese, cilantro, rice, black beans, sour cream, and tomatoes. I poured some salsa verde and salsa rojo on top, and it was BOMB. Every bite was just bursting with flavor! I was a happy camper with lots of yummy leftovers for breakfast the next day. Next time, I hope to order the same burrito smothered in verde sauce (+$1.50). My boyfriend also enjoyed his chicken enchiladas with molé sauce and was very full and satisfied after dinner.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is pleasant, considering that it&apos;s a food truck right off the main interstate street. They have string lights above and five outdoor tables spaces out, three of which are under a tarp if you&apos;re interested in sitting outside.\\n\\nService was good. We only had to wait 15-20 minutes after ordering and the lady handing out orders gave us extra sauce after asking. \\n\\nAll employees were wearing masks (over their mouths and noses!) and there is a big bottle of hand sanitizer right by the register. People were also good at social distancing, and it&apos;s much easier to spread out since it&apos;s outdoors.\\n\\nOverall: 5/5 for food, 5/5 for service, 5/5 for health and safety measures',\n",
       " 'I have heard legend of the burritos and other food here, but have had less opportunity to venture out since the onset of COVID. Thankfully, El Camion is available on DoorDash to help make things feel a little more normal. I had the steak quesadilla and trust and believe this was the fattest quesadilla I ever did see and it was incredible. Even a clean plate club like me couldn&apos;t finish this; it reheated pretty well the next day but I&apos;d recommend splitting something.',\n",
       " 'I love this location of El Camion!! They are consistently amazing. I have tried a number of things on the menu bust mostly tacos. Their chicken tacos and shrimp tacos are by far my favorite. The shrimp tacos come with fresh avocado that is always perfectly ripe. Their salsas are also super tasty. They can be a bit slow, but I don&apos;t mind as they are usually busy and it&apos;s only a few people working because it&apos;s a food truck.\\n\\nThe best thing about this location for me is the employees. My husband is usually the one who goes and picks it up, sometimes I will go. ONE time we brought our daughter with us and they gave her a free strawberry pastry that she loved. Now every time my husband has been back (months from them meeting our daughter) they ALWAYS ask about her. How kind! With the amount of people that eat at this location, I am so impressed and touched that they remember our kiddo. If the business survives the pandemic, they have a fan for life!!',\n",
       " 'Love love love their tamales!! Most bang for your buck food truck! \\n\\nHighly recommend their tamales - cheap, delicious and wholesome! They have a variety so I would go with any and you&apos;d be good. I think it&apos;s good for people who are on a budget and don&apos;t really feel like cooking during a week where you have so much work to do. \\n\\nI&apos;m sure their other dishes are just as amazing because I&apos;ve seen people line up near the Northeast Seattle food truck location during lunch and it gets busy. I&apos;ve also tried the one in Ballard but that location appears to be closed which is too bad because that&apos;s where the variety of tamales are based.',\n",
       " 'El Camion is probably the best Mexican food in Seattle proper, although that may be the equivalent to being the smartest idiot. That being said, the food here is real good and these people are not dumb. That was just an analogy. \\n\\n\\nIf you are looking to pay $16 plus a tip for some mediocre Mexican food like a lot of places in Seattle, you should go somewhere else. They serve up food of the people, you&apos;re able to get a filling, delicious meal for less than $11 and fast.\\n\\nThey offer an excellent variety of different Mexican food but you can never go wrong with the burritos here. I went in this evening and got a hearty carne asada burrito weighing in at over a pound and a half. \\n\\nI&apos;ve lived in Seattle a few years now and El Camion has always been a reliable staple of mine. Very good!',\n",
       " 'This place is a great bang for your buck. Lots a good food for a decent price! Be aware that the wait might be a little long depending on what time you go. If you are in lunch hours I&apos;d recommend ordering online. I get the Plato Mexicano. Its flavorful and juicy. They also have an assortment of sauces you can request. With the Carne Asada, the lady recommended the Avocado or Chipotle. Went along perfectly. Great for if you&apos;re feeling hungry and want a warm meal.',\n",
       " 'I have never had one of their burritos without having a slight stomach ache afterwards. Not because there&apos;s anything wrong with the burritos I just eat twice what I reasonably should here. Their burritos are rich, delicious, just sloppy enough, and enormous. I hit this place up at least like once every two months. Very crave-able, very satisfying, and I would 100% recommend.',\n",
       " 'El camion is Spanish for &apos;the truck&apos;. As in food truck. Located in the university area this is one of several locations and it has a permanent spot plus parking and  covered tables. \\n\\nFood: we tried the veggie burrito, pork enchiladas,fish tacos and shrimp quesadilla. Everything was completely awesome and flavorful. \\n\\nService: Friendly and efficient. Doesn&apos;t get any better than this. \\n\\nWe are going back.',\n",
       " 'I didn&apos;t expect to find mexican food this good in Seattle. We had burritos and they were fantastic, we were already thinking about when we could come back as we were pulling out of the parking lot. I tried the adobado, per the dude working there&apos;s request, and it was super flavorful and delicious. I also tried a couple of bites of the asada burrito and the asada was amazing! The chipotle salsa was to die for, I wish they bottled it. The guy taking our order was also super nice. I&apos;ll be back very soon!',\n",
       " 'Good tacos and location. This food truck is open often and is easy to get to. There&apos;s a big parking lot and it&apos;s right off sand point. There&apos;s some picnic benches for outdoor eating. The staff are friendly and fairly fast.\\nI&apos;ve gotten tacos and burritos here and enjoyed both. They have good flavor and a nice salsa to go with it. \\n\\nIt would be nice if the staff put their masks over their nose and not just their mouth.',\n",
       " 'Amazing!!! clean facility and fresh food you won&apos;t believe it came from a truck!!! The people were super friendly and took the time to explain things to me and answer all my questions the location was easy to find the parking was great there are times they are super busy as long as you don&apos;t go in a hurry but they do their best to get you in and out in a timely manner I will definitely be going back to this place several times over and over you can never get too much good Mexican food.',\n",
       " 'El Camion has been a favorite or ours for well over a decade. When the Sand Point truck arrived we were thrilled and have eaten there plenty of times. Last night was the first time things were totally off. Picked up our online order around 6:30 and the carne asada was super dry, some burnt. The preparation appeared rushed and things looked sloppy. Flavors weren&apos;t as savory and authentic.  Not sure what went wrong but it was saddening. Hope things return to normal soon.',\n",
       " 'I had to increase the overall rating here because while I wasn&apos;t thrilled about what I ordered, my friend who is a very hard to please carne asada person loved their carne asada burrito, saying it was the best in the PNW!',\n",
       " 'I really want to like this place, however I&apos;ve been here twice and both times my order was incorrect. Disappointing.',\n",
       " 'These MF tacos S-L-A-P!!!\\n\\nThe chicken tacos, the steak joints, the shrimp ones and shoooot even the pork ones are all delectable. \\n\\nThe quesadillas make my mouth water and they have a plethora of different sauces, I recommend trying every singe one. \\n\\nI&apos;ve never had a bad experience, they always give me an overwhelming amount of meat and rice and of course I love that. AND it&apos;s affordable. \\n\\nThe fact that they support Black Lives Matter is just another overall plus. Support this business they&apos;re tasty. \\n\\n***Pro-tip: If you&apos;re a tad bit impatient call in 10-15 min before you arrive and it&apos;ll be done upon arrival',\n",
       " 'First time visiting this El Camion taco truck. It was pretty darn good. \\nAlso first time getting their burritos. Normally just go with the &quot;street tacos&quot;. But may now be a convert to burritos. Especially when they weigh over 2lbs each. And yes I weighed them at home on my food scale. \\n\\nHubby had the fish burrito. He loves the El Chupacabra version and wanted to compare. I think he prefers El Chupacabra but that&apos;s based on dine in and not to go. I guess we will have to get takeout from El Chupacabra soon. (Oh rats) I had the carne asada burrito and while it was good I wish I would have got chicken instead. \\n\\n When hubby arrived for pickup there were at least 5 people in line in front of him including one person ordering for at least 8 people. . Hubby was smart &amp; went &amp; sat in his truck til he saw that large order filled. \\n\\nGreat staff went on an ingredient run to the nearest grocery store to keep supplies in stock to meet order demand. \\n\\nWill return again!',\n",
       " 'Forget your lunch plans because you have new ones!  \\nEl Camión is the best authentic Mexican food I&apos;ve had in Seattle, period.  I used to live in Oaxaca and worked in Mexico City so though I am blonde, I consider myself to be an excellent judge and tough critic when it comes to Mexican food.\\nI was hungry after tennis so I ordered a lot, little did I know the servings were so big, yeah :)  We ended up having Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos for lunch with four different kinds of salsa.  \\nFor dinner we had the special of the day, Chile Rellenos with black beans and rice. DIOS MÍO, que rico!  \\nMy boyfriend and I are officially full now smiling on the couch.  \\nGracias a Él Camion, Bien Hecho y Buen Provencho!',\n",
       " 'Closest spot to the Mexican food I miss in SoCal, these guys are great. Gorditas are great and the tripas is really good (some places do them terribly)',\n",
       " 'Everytime I come to this truck my order gets messed up in a different way. I asked for a burrito with asada and no rice. I ended up with dry shredded beef that tastes like it&apos;s been in a crock pot for two days it&apos;s so dry.\\nAnd full Of rice. So I got nothing but a tortilla filled with rice a couple couple shreds of horribly dry beef. And the second burrito I got was also supposed to be asada and they gave me pork!!!\\nThis is the last time I got to el camion!!!!',\n",
       " 'It&apos;s an okay spot for tacos. Good bonus points because it&apos;s a decent spot to pick up food if you&apos;re hungry and going to the Burke-Gilman brewing next door (you can bring food inside). \\n\\nWe picked up tacos. Overall tacos were decent but they were average. Adobada - spicy grilled pork was decent. Juicy but a little salty.  Chorizo - I didn&apos;t like it. A little too moist kind of like a sloppy joe more than the dryer spiced chorizo. Not my favorite. Carne - probably the best of the tacos I had. Good! Shrimp - decent but the shrimp itself lacked flavors to make it special. \\n\\nService was great and friendly. \\n\\nIf you&apos;re hungry and need an option, it&apos;s a good place. I heard their burritos are way better so will have try their burritos next time. But it didn&apos;t knock it out of the park for me. It simply fed me and I was satisfied.']"
